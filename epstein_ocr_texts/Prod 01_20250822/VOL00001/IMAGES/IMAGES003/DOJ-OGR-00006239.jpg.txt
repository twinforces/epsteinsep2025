such an opinion is irrelevant and should be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,
e.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 209 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 21 (“expert testimony
should be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal

To the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not
reliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue
relationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and

disclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative
frequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such
opinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s own writings on grooming; if he truly
believes that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing
provided by their abusers, it would be hard to see how he could express surprise that “even today,
far too many people, including many who should know better, have difficulty grasping the
possibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their
preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allow them to
accept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allowing things that others find
abhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29
(2018), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .

To the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense
has clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer
this uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have attained
