such an opinion is irrelevant and:should. be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,
eg, LVL XH Brands, Iné., 209 F. Supp. 3d.at 6422 Boucher, 73, F.3d at 21 (“expert testimony’
should. be:excluded. if iit is. [inter alia] in essence an. apples. and oranges. comparison” (internal
quotation.marks'and cllipsis omitted)).

To the extent:Dr. Dictz intends instead to opine. on.the. former category, that opinion is not’
reliable. Such an, opinion—essentially that: it. is highly unlikely for abuse: victims to continue
relationships, ‘with their: abusers after the first: act of sexual assault=is ‘patently. implausible and
inconsistent with the extensive literature: on grooming,, the pimp-prostitute ‘relationship, delayed
disclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset. of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative
frequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact’with their abusers. Indeed, such
‘opinions would:scem in great tension. even with. Dr. Dictz’s own writings on grooming; if he truly
believes that abused, children are unlikely to continue contact with, their abusers or wear clothing:
provided by their abusers, it'would be hard to see. how he could express surprise that “even ‘today,
far too many: people, including many who should ‘know: better, have difficulty’ grasping the:
possibility of ‘nonforceful, nonthreatening, and. nonviolent: acquaintance molestation, as their
preconceptions: of childhood innocence and predatory: molesters are too strong to allow them. to
accept, that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allowing things that. others find.
abhorrent.” (See Park, Dictz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal. Violence 28, 29
(2018), Ex. D;.see also Ex. A.at.3 (citing id). .

To the extent:Dr. Dictz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense:
has clearly‘not'to date-carried the burden of cstablishing'that the methods‘that'léd-Dr. Dictz'to offer

thisuncited. and implausible: opinion arc subject to peer review and publication, have attained.
