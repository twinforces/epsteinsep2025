1 can't you just have put that in a binder, a paper binder, in

2 advance? And as I said, if there's something that comes up or
3 you realize you neglected to put it in, we could deal with

4 that. But by and large, you're directing them to a tab ina

5 binder, just like you would direct your paralegal to show a

6 particular document on the screen. What am I missing?

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, we can try that, your Honor. And
8 we'll see how it goes. I mean, we'll be prepared to do it both
9 ways.

10 THE COURT: And I assure you, if for some reason

11 there's something you want to show that's not in the binder, we
12 will work that out and you won't be precluded from showing it.
13 But to the extent you've prepared your cross outline and you

14 know what you're going to ask about, just like you would call
15 it up, just have that in a tabbed binder so they can turn to

16 it.

17 And, again, to be completely clear, should there be

18 anything you need to do that wasn't in the binder, you'll be

19 able to do it and we'll either hand up paper in those few
20 instances or we'll turn off the table monitors and show it on
al the screen.
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: OK, your Honor. Thank you.
23 THE COURT: Thank you.
24 What else?
25 No? OK.
