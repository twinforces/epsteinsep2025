Can't yot’ just. have put that in a binder, a paper binder, in
advance? And as I said, if there's something that comes up or
you réealizé you neglected ‘to put Tt in, we could déal with
that. But by and large, you're directing them to a tab in a
binder, just! like ‘you would direct yotir paralegal 'to Show a
particular document on the screen. What am L missing?

MR. PAGEIUCA: Well, we can try that, yotir Honor. And
we'll see how it goes. I mean, we'll be prepared to do it both
ways.

THE COURT: And I assure ‘you, Jf for some reason
there's something you want to show that's not ih the binder, we
will work that. out and you, won't. be precluded from showing it.
But to thé extént you've prepared your ero6ss d6utline and you
know what you're going to ask about, just Like you, would call
it up, just have that. in a tabbed binder so they Gan turn to
Lt.

And, again; to be completely clear, should there be
anything you need to do that wasn't in, the binder, you'll be
able to dé it. and we'll either hand up paper in those few
instances or we'll turn off the table monitors and show it on
the screen:

MR. PAGLIUCA: OK, your Honor. Thank, you,

THE COURT: Thank. you.

What, el'se?

No? “ORK.
