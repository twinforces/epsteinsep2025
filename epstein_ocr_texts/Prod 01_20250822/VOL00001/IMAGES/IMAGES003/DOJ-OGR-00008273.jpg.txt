Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter renewing its application for the admission
of Government Exhibit 52, the contact book. At trial on December 2, the Court reserved its
decision on whether to admit the book during the testimony of Juan Alessi. 12/02/21 Tr. at 876.
At the time, the Government anticipated calling Employee-1, who was expected to provide
additional authentication testimony. The Government no longer intends to call Employee-1 to
testify at trial, but additional corroboration of Government Exhibit 52’s authenticity has been
received in evidence. The Government therefore submits that the issue is ripe for resolution, and
that the exhibit should be admitted.

The lone issue before the Court is whether the Government has established the authenticity
