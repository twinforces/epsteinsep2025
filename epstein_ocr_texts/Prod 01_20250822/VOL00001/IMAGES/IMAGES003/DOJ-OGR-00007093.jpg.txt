Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 465 Filed 11/15/21 Page 42 of 127 42
LB15MAX2

1 voluntary dismissal of civil litigation pursuant to a

2 settlement agreement, and after the dismissal the defendant

3 sought costs as a prevailing party under Federal Rule of Civil
4 Procedure 54(d)(1), and at least as described in the papers the
a alleged victims opted to pay the fairly minimal amount sought

6 rather than burden the court and other resources with continued
7 litigation.

8 The fact that the defendant received costs pursuant to
9 civil procedure 54(d) after a civil settlement just has no

10 relevance to the charges at hand as far as I can tell and there
11 is substantial danger of confusing the issues and misleading

12 the jury. If the defense elicited that the defendant was the
13 prevailing party, a layjuror would almost certainly assume that
14 that was some kind of adjudication on the merits relevant to

15 this case but there is no evidence that there was any relevance
16 adjudication on the merits and certainly none relevant to the
17 case. Any probative value gained by the introduction would be
18 substantially outweighed by juror confusion and the waste of

19 time needed to explain the differing postures of the current
20 case and the prior civil litigation. So on those 401/403
al balancing grounds the government's motion in this regard is
22 granted.
23 Any questions before I turn to the defense motions?
24 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank
25 you.
