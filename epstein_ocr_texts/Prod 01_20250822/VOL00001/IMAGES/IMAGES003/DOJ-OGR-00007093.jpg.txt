Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.465 Filed 11/15/21. Page 42 of 127 42

LB1 5MAX 2:

voluntary dismissal of Cimil litigation pursuant t6 4
settlement. agreement, and after the dismissal the defendant
sought, Costs as a prevailing party under Fédéral Rule of Civil
Procedure 54(d) (1), and at least as described in the papers the
alleged victims opted 'to pay the fairly minimal dmount sotight
rather than burden. the court and other resources with continued
litigation.

The fact that the defendant received costs pursuant to

civil procéedtire 54(d) after a Civil settlement just has no

relevance to the charges at hand as far as I can tell and there

1s Substantial danger of confusing the issues ahd misleading

the juny. If the defense elicited that the defendant was. the
prevailing party, a layjuror would almost. certainly assume that
that, was some kind of adjudicat:ion, on the merits relevant ‘to
this Gase but there is no evidence that there was ahy relevance
adjudication on the merits and certainly none melevant to ‘the
case. Any probative value gained by the intréduction would be
substantially outweighed by jurner confusion and, the waste of
time needed to explain the differing postures of the Current
case and the prior civil litigation. So on those 401/403
balancing grounds. the. goverhment's motion ih this. regard is
granted,

Any questions before I turh to the défense métions?

MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank.
you.
