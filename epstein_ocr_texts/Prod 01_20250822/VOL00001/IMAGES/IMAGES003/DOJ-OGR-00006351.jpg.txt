Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 435 Filed 11/11/21 Page10of11

United States v2 Duncan, 42 F.3d.97, 101 (2d Cir. 1994)).. For the reasons already provided, the
Court finds that fit is satisfied here.

‘Lhird, the probative valuc.of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is. not:substantially outweighed by
403 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. ‘The: Court:finds that.Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would:not unduly
“simplify” an otherwise. complex case” or mislead jurors by'a supposedly’ infallible expert. Dkt.
No., 386 at]... Dr. Rocchio’s opinions speak,only to concepts and-will not. (and indeed may:not)
suggest that. the jury find any alleged victim:witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty.
The:more general nature of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which the Court heard:in detail at the
Daubert hearing, therefore:mitigates its prejudicial effect. Velles,.6'F.4th at 1097. Itis the jury’s
‘role to, determine whether and. how Dr. Rocchio’s opinions apply to the facts of this case and. the:
eredibility:of the witnesses.

Last, as'previously‘mentioned, the Court will grant in part:the Defense’s Danherf motion.
The Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion. that’ grooming ‘can, be donc to facilitate sexual
abuse by a third-party: or thatthe presence of'a third party can ‘otherwise facilitate: grooming is
unreliable. The Defense calls this,““grooming-by-proxy.” /:2:, Dkt. No. 386 at.9. Terminology:
aside, the Court agrecs’with this narrower. objection to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. As:discusscd at
the hearing, this phenomenon. is ‘not identificd.in the relevant literature regarding child. sexual
abuse and.has not been subjected, to, peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to
bean extrapolation. of the'broader principle of how grooming functions. through the development.
of trust: That extrapolation may’be logical, and ‘follow common, sense, but it is. forthe: jury to
maké on the facts, of this case. The.Court'therefore excludes Dr. Roéchio’s, opinion: that the
presence: of a-third party can facilitate grooming. Dr, Rocchio’s:core opinions about grooming,

however, remain, admissible under the Rule 702 and Danbert:standard and remain. relevant
