1 Instruction No. 15: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — First
2 Element
3 The first element of Count Two which the government must prove beyond a reasonable
4 doubt is that Ms. Maxwell knowingly persuaded or induced or enticed or coerced an individual
5 to travel in interstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment. The terms “persuaded,” “induced,”
6 “enticed,” and “coerced” have their ordinary, everyday meanings.
7 The term “interstate commerce” simply means movement from one state to another. The
8 term “State” includes a State of the United States and the District of Columbia.
9 “Knowingly” Defined
10 Ms. Maxwell must have acted knowingly. An act is done knowingly when it is done
11 voluntarily and intentionally and not because of accident, mistake, or some other innocent reason.
12 Now, knowledge is a matter of inference from the proven facts. Science has not yet
13. devised a manner of looking into a person’s mind and knowing what that person is thinking.
14. Whether Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly may be proven by Ms. Maxwell’s conduct and by all of
15 the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.
