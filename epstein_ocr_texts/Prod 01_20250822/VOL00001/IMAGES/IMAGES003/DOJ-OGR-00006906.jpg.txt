situation here, in which the alleged “groomer” was not the person who perpetrated
the alleged abuse.

e Even where the “groomer” and “perpetrator” are the same person, courts have
recognized the unreliability of grooming testimony. United States v. Gonyer, No.
1:12-CR-00021-JAW, 2012 WL 3043020, at *2-3 (D. Me. July 24, 2012); United
States v. Raymond, 700 F. Supp. 2d 142, 146-47 (D. Me. 2010); United States v.
Schneider, No. CRIM.A. 10-29, 2010 WL 3734055, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 22,
2010); see also United States v. Raniere, No. 18-CR-2041-NGG-VMS, 2019 WL

grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic settings as it does not
meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard.” Resp., Ex. A, p 19.

e The government says Rocchio’s opinions are not “anecdotal.” But that’s not right
either, as her endorsement makes clear: Rocchio’s opinions are based “on her

violence, and sexual abuse /and her] extensive clinical experience treating
individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in childhood and adolescence,
