The very case the government cites in support of their position, United States v. Curley,
639 F.3d 50 (2d.Cir. 2011), affirmed’the district court’s decision to admit “other'act” evidence of
prior spousal abuse to:prove “intent” and “pattern” under-Rule 404(b) “with.an appropriate
instruction, on this, cvidence’s limited purpose,” not as direct evidence, of the conspiracy. See
Curley, 639 F.3d at'S9 (citing United States, ¥. Von Foelkel, 136 F.3d 339, 340-41 (2d Cir. 1998)
prove defendant’s, intent-under Rule 404(b)). Indeed, the evidence could not have been admitted
as direct evidence ofa conspiracy because: Curley: was not charged with a conspiracy. See
United States v» Curley, No. 81, 08 Cr. 404 (SCR), 2009 WL 10688209, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 15,
2009) (defendant was convicted of two counts of stalking and one: count of interstate violation of
a:protection.order). Curley therefore supports the defense’s position that the admissibility of[_]
CL_____]evidence ‘must be evaluated under Rule 404(b).

Second, ‘the. government does not confront. the defense’s. point that simply including
conspiracy. Seé Mot. at.9=10. Instead, the government cngages'‘in circular‘rcasoning by.
effectively:arguing that (i) allegations in.an indictment are:not 404(b) evidence, (ii) _]
| allegations arc’ in the indictment, (iii) therefore they are’ not 404(b) evidence. See
Reésp. at 46-47. But'as the defense pointed. out in its Motion, “other acts” are only admissible as
evidence ofa conspiracy “as long as'they are within. the scope of the conspiracy. ” United States
vi, Cummings, 60. F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.DIN.Y. 2014), vacated on other.grounds 858 F.3d, 763
(2d Cir. 201.7) (quoting United. States v. Baguric, 106 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. 1983)). The

government has not explained why [___] evidence:provides any proof that Ms.

Maxwell “furthered” an.alleged conspiracy’to, cause minors (she did not)'to, raxel (she did not)
