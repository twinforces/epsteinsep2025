LB1LTMAX3:

Victims' Rights Act, S56 we want to confer with victims' counsel

on. that issue as well before we reach a conclusion. ‘on that.

The définition set forth in the restitution Sstattite,
which is 18 USC 3663(a) (2), for purposes of the section, the
term "Victim" means a person diréctly and proximately Harméd as
a cesult of the commission. of an offense for which restitution
tiay be ordered.

So that's the particular issue that we just want. to

think ‘through before we réach a conclusion, on in particular

because we're mindful of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. So L

apologize, it's nét my intehtioh, certainly, to fight the

hypothetical, we wanted, to be ‘thoughtful about that issue.
THE COURT: You will get. me your views on that
question with respect to nestatutaon, but as I understand ‘your
initial point, for purposes; as you said, of the elements of
establishing any of the offenses, the government."s view is that
this individudl is not a victim in the sénse == granting that.

restitution's definition of "victim" could be broader ‘than,
those for whom the government.'s proof of elements as to the
charged account would show to be victims, I think that's the
distinetion you're trying to draw:

MS. MOE: Your Honor, our position is that we
recognize Minor Victam=3's testimény aloné would not satisfy
the elements of the conspiracy count in which the overt acts

appear, our view is nonetheless that it's ‘direct evidence.
