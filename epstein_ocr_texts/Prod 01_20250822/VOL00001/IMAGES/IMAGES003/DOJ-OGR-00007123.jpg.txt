1 Victims' Rights Act, so we want to confer with victims' counsel
2 on that issue as well before we reach a conclusion on that.

3 The definition set forth in the restitution statute,

4 which is 18 USC 3663(a) (2), for purposes of the section, the

5 term "victim" means a person directly and proximately harmed as
6 a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution
7 may be ordered.

8 So that's the particular issue that we just want to

9 think through before we reach a conclusion on in particular

10 because we're mindful of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. So lI
11 apologize, it's not my intention, certainly, to fight the

12 hypothetical, we wanted to be thoughtful about that issue.

13 THE COURT: You will get me your views on that

14 question with respect to restitution, but as I understand your
15 initial point, for purposes, as you said, of the elements of

16 establishing any of the offenses, the government's view is that
17 this individual is not a victim in the sense -- granting that
18 restitution's definition of "victim" could be broader than

19 those for whom the government's proof of elements as to the
20 charged account would show to be victims, I think that's the
21 distinction you're trying to draw.
22 MS. MOE: Your Honor, our position is that we
23 recognize Minor Victim-3's testimony alone would not satisfy
24 the elements of the conspiracy count in which the overt acts
25 appear, our view is nonetheless that it's direct evidence.
