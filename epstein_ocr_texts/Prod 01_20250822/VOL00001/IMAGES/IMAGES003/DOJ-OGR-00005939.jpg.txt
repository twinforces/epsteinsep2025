first tio" of children who participated in forensic/investigative interviews where
Irst ume children are interviewed by professionals due to concerns that the child has
been sexually abused. The issue of partial disclosures was highlighted by
earlier studies such as those by DeVoe and Faller (1999) of five- to ten-year
olds (i.e. making detailed informal disclosures that were not replicated in
formal interviews) and Elliott and Briere (1994) of children aged eight to
15 years (i.e. disclosing only partial information until confronted with external
evidence that led to more complete disclosures).

More recently, investigators have examined the role of the interviewer and
questioning styles in the forensic interview and how this impacts on children’s
disclosures and the level of detail provided in interview. Hershkowitz ef al.
(2006) compared tapes of interviews with children who disclosed sexual abuse
and those who did not (but about whom there was ‘substantial’ reason to
believe that they had been abused). They found that interviewers behaved

‘They found that differently with the two groups, using different types of prompts with children
interviewers behaved who presented as somewhat uncooperative, offered fewer details and gave
diff tl ith th more uninformative responses at the beginning of the interview. It would
Perea wl e appear that interviewers responded to less communicative children by
two groups’ increasing the proportion of closed questions which in turn led to children
being less forthcoming. Lamb ef al, (2002) have found that the use of a
protocol that emphasises the use of prompts that elicit free narrative (e.g. ‘tell
me about that’) as compared with closed questions (those requiring a yes/no
response) has resulted in more detail and more accuracy in children’s

accounts.

Although few studies exist that examine the phenomenon of disclosure in
informal settings (when disclosure is made to a friend or family member),
some qualitative studies have described this process. McElvaney (2008) quoted
one teenage girl who described hinting to her mother prior to disclosing the
experience: ‘I didn’t tell her what happened but I was saying things that made

‘A parent described her think it made her think that it happened but I didn’t tell her’ (p. 127). A

how her teenage son parent described how her teenage son told her over a period of days, keeping
‘ the most difficult parts of the story until last:

told her over a period of

days’ “He came out with like it came out over two or three days so you know. ...he’d say well

[ve something else to tell you... the bad stuff last... what hurt him most and what he’s

saying what hurt him most’ (p. 92)

And finally, one young person described how she told her social worker:

‘Tcouldn’t tell her most things but I just gave things to her to read. . . [told her at first I told
her bits of it and em then just the others. I finished writing and then I gave them to her. . . later

I told her that it was the father as well. (p. 93)

This young person had been abused by both a father and son in a family with
whom she was staying.
