high.nuiibers of respondents disclosing to researchers forthe first-time.
Patterns of Disclosure: — Partial Disclosure
Information. on how children disclose over time can be obtained. from studies

of children. who participated an. forensic/investigative interviews ‘where
children are. interviewed by: professionals ‘due to: concerns ‘that the child has

‘been Sexually ablised. ‘The isstie of partial, disclosures ' was: highlighted by

earlier studies such as those by: DeVoe: and Faller (1999) of five- to ten-year
olds (i.c, making: detailed. informal disclosures that ‘were not. ‘replicated. in
formal. interviews). and, Elliott and Briere:(1994) of children aged eight to.
1S years (i.e. disclosing only partial information, until.confrontéd with external
evidence'that: led to ‘more complete disclosures).

More ‘recently, investigators have: examined the role of the interviewer and
questioning styles in the forensic interview and.how‘this’ impacts on.children’s
disclosures and the level of detail. provided in. interview. Hershkowitz: et al.
(2006) compared tapes of interviews with children who disclosed.sex tial abuse.
and. those who did not (but about whom there was ‘substantial’ reason: to

‘believe: that they: had ‘been abused). They: found that: interviewers ‘behaved

differently withthe two groups, using different types of prompts with children:
who, presented. .as. somewhat uncooperative, offered ‘fewer details and. gave.

‘more uninformative responses atthe beginning of the interview. It would

appear that interviewers’ responded to less communicative children. by
increasing the proportion.:of closed questions: which in. turn led to.:childreny
Lamb: ef al. (2002) Have foufid ‘that: the use Of a

response) has resulted in. more’ detail and .more accuracy’ in. children’s
accounts.

Although, few studiés. exist that examine ‘the phenomenon, of disclosure in
informal settings (when disclosure ‘is ‘made to ‘a friend or family member),
some qualitative studies have described this process: McElvancy (2008) quoted
one teenage girl who described ‘hinting to her mother ‘prior to, disclosing ‘the
experience: “I didn’t, tell her what happened but I was saying me that made.
her: think it ‘made her think that: it happened but. I didn’t: tell. her” (p. 127). A.

‘parent described how her'teenage son told her over'a period of aye keeping,
‘the most difficult:parts :of the story. until, last:

‘lathe he’d say*well
t and what he’s

And, finally, one: young person, described how she: told her social worker:

“Lcotildi’ trell herinostthings but Ljustgave things.to her‘to.read. .. Ptold herarcfirse Ltold
her bits of ittand.em then just'the.others. [finished writing and ‘then.T gave them.to her. . . later
I told her, that it was:the; father as well? (p. 93)

This young. person had-been.abused by both a father and son in.a-family with.
whom she was staying.
