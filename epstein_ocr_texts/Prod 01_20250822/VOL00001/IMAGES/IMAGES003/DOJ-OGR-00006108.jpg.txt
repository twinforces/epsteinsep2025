| charged, and that Ms. Maxwellthe defendant aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced or
procured that person to commit the crime.

As you can see, the first requirement is that another person has committed the crime
charged. Obviously, no one can be convicted of aiding and abetting the criminal acts of another
if no crime was committed by the other person. But if you do find that a crime was committed,

| then you must consider whether Ms. Maxwell the defendant aided or abetted the commission of
the crime.

To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that the Government prove that
the defendant willfully and knowingly associated herself in some way with the crime committed
by the other person and willfully and knowingly sought by some act to help the crime succeed.

However, let me caution you that the mere presence of the defendant where a crime is
being committed, even when coupled with knowledge by the defendant that a crime is being
committed, or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the criminal conduct of others, even with
guilty knowledge, is not sufficient to make the defendant guilty under this approach of aiding
and abetting. Such a defendant would be guilty under this approach of aiding and abetting only
if, in addition to knowing of the criminal activity, she actually took actions intended to help it
succeed.

An aider and abettor must know that the crime is being committed and act in a way that is
intended to bring about the success of the criminal venture.

| To determine whether Ms. Maxwell adeferndantaided or abetted the commission of the
crime with which she is charged, ask yourself these questions:
| 1. Did Ms. Maxwell the-defendantparticipate in the crime charged as something she
wished to bring about?
