LBAAMAX1ps Rocchio â€” Direct

1 techniques to arrive at the -- my professional opinion.

2 Q. What if any licenses do you have?

3 A. I'm Licensed to practice psychology currently in the states
4 of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York.

S Q. In your career, for approximately how many years --

6 THE COURT: Sorry. May I ask, Dr. Rocchio, that point
7 you made about not taking what someone says at face value, you
8 distinguish that as part of your forensic practice?

9 THE WITNESS: Yes.

10 THE COURT: And what about in your clinical practice?
11 THE WITNESS: In my clinical practice, it's not -- I
12 have to deal with what the patients tell me in the room. It's
13 not my job to go out and verify any part of what's being told
14 in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear what they're telling
15 me and then relate that back to my other skills-training

16 experience, the scientific literature. Someone, for example,
17 might report to me symptoms of depression. I could ask them

18 how that's manifesting in their life, but I don't go to their
19 house to see if they're actually staying in bed all day. That
20 kind of thing.
21 THE COURT: Thank you.
