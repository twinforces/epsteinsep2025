2. Commonsense Principles Within the Ken of the Jury

The following opinions by Dr. Loftus are commonsense opinions within the ken of the
jury:

e How memory fades and weakens over time, as described in Paragraph | above.

e How memory may become vulnerable to contamination, as described in Paragraph 2 above.

e How an individual with a false memory may believe that their memory is accurate, as
described in Paragraph 5(b) above.

e Examples of suggestive activities, such as news and media reports and
discussions/conversations with others, as listed in Paragraph 6 above.

Any testimony from Dr. Loftus with respect to these commonsense principles of memory
and perception should be excluded under Rules 703 and 403 because such testimony would not
aid the jury. “It is common knowledge that memory fades with time.” Labansat, 94 F.3d at 530
(affirming district court denial of defendant’s motion to retain an eyewitness expert). An expert
is simply not needed to “point out that memory decreases over time.” United States v. Welch, 368
F.3d 970, 973-75 (7th Cir. 2004) (excluding eyewitness memory and perception expert). In
excluding a memory and perception expert in Libby, the court explained:

[O]n a daily basis the average juror is personally faced with innumerable

questions of memory and cognition, as everyone in their daily lives is called

upon to store, encode, and retrieve information he or she has been subjected

to. Although the average juror may not understand the scientific basis and

labels attached to causes for memory errors, jurors inevitably encounter the

frailties of memory as a commonplace matter of course.
Libby, 461 F. Supp. 2d at 12-13. It is similarly common knowledge that memories can be
contaminated, including through exposure to news media. Jurors, like all individuals, may be
asked to remember something, and may become confused as to the source of the memory. And it
