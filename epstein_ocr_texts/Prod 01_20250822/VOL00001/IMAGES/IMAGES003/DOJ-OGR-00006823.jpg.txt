Abstract The current review aims to outline the existing understanding of sexual grooming. Issues
of poor definition, the adoption of the term “grooming” and the prevalence of sexual grooming will be
discussed. Consideration will be given to how prominent theories of child sexual abuse often neglect
sexual grooming. This will be followed by a detailed account of the existing knowledge within the
literature. Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the
environment and significant others and grooming the child. Based on these findings, a new definition
of sexual grooming is suggested. Furthermore, the findings correspond well with current models of the
sexual offence process. A more comprehensive understanding of sexual grooming 1s required to facilitate
a preventative approach to child protection.

behaviour. Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still little
understanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,
which will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will
consider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual
grooming” behaviour, and further determines what knowledge has already been established
about the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is
presented and consideration is given to how current knowledge of sexual grooming relate to
models of the sexual offence process.

Previous literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming. The strengths and
