ropriate Limiting Instruction

by Epstéin, and Give the Jury an Apj

If the Court determines that:the evidence: rclated to.Accuser-3:is admissible, cither as
direct evidence: of the charged conspiracies or'as 404(b) evidence, the: Court should (1) preclude:
the government and Accuser-3 from referring. to Accuscr-3 as a “minor” orasserting that she was
a.“minor” at the time.of the alleged sex. acts, (2)’preelude: the government.and Accuser-3 from
representing that: she was.“sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an
appropriate limiting instruction. related.to Accuser-3’s testimony.

was “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase. “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even

conduct that (1): is #//egal, (2) involves. sexual. activity, and.(3) is directed.at a: person younger than 18

):(quoting government's brief): (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s

years old.

“subjective experience” of these ‘incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual.abuse” should not. be

allowed because it will mislead the jury into thinking that:Accuser-3 efigaged in “criminal. sexual
