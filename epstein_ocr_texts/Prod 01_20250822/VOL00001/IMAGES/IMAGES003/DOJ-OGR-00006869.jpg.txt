Disclosure Patterns in Child Sexual Abuse

pressure’ for young people by:providing, opportunities to. tell-may: be. needed to
help young people tell more promptly: However; the lack of control that-young
people: experience: following disclosure ‘remains an issue (Ungar-ét a/., 2009b;
Quayle efal., 2012), This highlights the need. for dissemination of information
directly to young people about the legal. process, the possible consequences of
disclosure, as well. as ongoing developments in legal. proceedings when:young
people. and theit families: interface ‘with the legal system.

The ‘more’ recent ‘focus on; inyestigating those strategies that: children; use dn
making: disclosures ‘rather’ than solely ‘on identifying. barriers to disclosure is
perhaps ‘more helpful in) informing awareness-raising campaigns and.
professional interventions. ‘The: author’ is involved in 4 large-scale review of
children’s files in an assessment service to ascertain those factors that helped.
children tell about their experiences of sexual abuse. A. pilot study’ has
suggesicd that this is an. appropriate methodology: for gathering data, on.
children’s expériences of informal disclosure, acknowledging the limitations
of such an approach. Ungar er al: (2009a) describe: the: optimal, conditions for:
disclosure: as follows: being directly asked about experiences ofabuse; haying
access to someone who will listen, believe and respond appropriately; ‘having
knowledge and language about what constitutes abuse and-how-to-access ‘help;
having a sense 6f control, over the: process of disclosure both, in, terms of their:
anonymity (not being identified until they are:ready“for this) and confidentiality
(the right to control. who knows); and. effective responses by adults both.in
informal and ‘formal contexts.

Ungar ét al. (2009b) stipport:recent developments.in prevention programmes
that target supportive formal, and ‘informal, caregivers’ in, being better able to
‘detect the: possibility of abuse and ‘support disclosures. rather than. focusing
on, empowering, children themselves in. making disclosures. Their findings: in
relation 16 the importance of bridge building for young-people to access formal
supports are supported by Jensen er al.'s (2005) emphasis’ on: the: dialogical
nature of disclosure, and the: important role that ‘trusted. adults ‘and peers play
in the disclosure’ process ‘through noticing signs ofpsychological. distress and
asking, young, people. about their psychological wellbeing (Collings et al.,
2005;.Jensen ét.al.; 2005; McElvaney ér-al.; 2012). More cmphasi is therefore
needed ‘on, ‘providing opportunities for children and. young people’ to disclose.
The: challenge: for professionals and those who. care for. children. is how to: do
this ina way: that protects children and promotes their wellbeing.
