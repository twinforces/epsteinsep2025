an order will likely permit the Government to interpose a Daubert challenge now. Absent rapid
supplemental notice along these lines, the Court should preclude the forensic document specialists.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Government respectfully requests that the Court
preclude the testimony of Dr. Ryan Hall and Bennett Gershman; preclude any expert testimony
(as opposed to fact testimony) by Robert Kelso or John Lopez; and preclude any testimony at all
from the forensic document specialists, unless and until the defendant provides supplemental
expert notice, which the Court should order the defense to provide forthwith.
