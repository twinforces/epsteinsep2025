United States v. Graham, No. 14 Cr. 500 (NSR), 2015 WL 6161292, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20,
2015) (same).

Finally, whatever minimal probative value the rape allegation might have would be
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading
the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 403. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, rape is highly
emotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2
Indictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admitting testimony of an alleged rape would pose a serious risk
that the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will
convict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 519
U.S. 172, 181 (1997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 681 F.2d 61, 63 (1st Cir. 1982) (Breyer,
J.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and
mislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged
offense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.
See United States v. Stein, 521 F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (excluding other-act
evidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 403 because of the “risk that this evidence would
confuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should
therefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.

XI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS "VICTIMS" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING
Without explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the
government disagrees that use of the term "victim" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial

amounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the
word will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.
Rocchio's testimony concerning her patients. Resp. at 77. The government's legal analysis and
