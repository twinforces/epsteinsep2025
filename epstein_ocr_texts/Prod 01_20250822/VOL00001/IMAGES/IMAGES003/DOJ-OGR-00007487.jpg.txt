Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 499 _ Filed 11/23/21 Page 22 of 28
Sciences was asked to conduct a thorough study of scientific research relating to eyewitness
testimony and memory. In response, the National Research Council formed a committee, co-
chaired by the Honorable Jed Rakoff and Thomas Albright, a prominent cognitive scientist at the
Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In 2014, the committee published its report: /dentifying the
Culprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification (Natl. Res. Counc. 2014): “Human visual perception
and memory are changeable, the ability to recognize individuals is imperfect, and policies
governing law enforcement procedures are not standard—and any of these limitations can
produce mistaken identifications with serious consequences” Jd. The committee recommended
that judges admit expert testimony as a way of educating juries on the science of memory. An
alternative recommendation, having the court deliver a carefully crafted jury instructions that
could accomplish this same educational goal, requires the daunting task of devising the right
instructions. See Rakoff J & Loftus EF, The intractability of inaccurate eyewitness identification
(2018).
eyewitness identification, expert testimony regarding the accuracy of that identification is
admissible and properly may be encouraged ...”); United States v. Downing, 753 F.2d 1224,
1232 (3d Cir. 1985) (reasoning that “expert testimony on eyewitness perception and memory
[should] be admitted at least in some circumstances”); United States v. Smith, 736 F.2d 1103,
1107 (6th Cir. 1984) (“The day may have arrived, therefore, when Dr. Fulero’s testimony can be
said to conform to a generally accepted explanatory theory.”)). As also noted by the court in
Smithers, “[s|tate court decisions also reflect this trend.” (citing State v. Buell, 22 Ohio St.3d
124, 489 N.E.2d 795 (1986) (overruling per se rule and holding expert testimony admissible to
inform jury about factors generally affecting memory process)). Moreover, the court noted that
“several courts have held that it is an abuse of discretion to exclude such expert testimony.”
(citing United States v. Stevens, 935 F.2d 1380, 1400-01 (3d Cir. 1991) (reversing and
remanding for new trial); Smith, 736 F.2d at 1107 (holding error harmless in light of other
inculpatory evidence); Downing, 753 F.2d at 1232 (holding error harmless in light of other
inculpatory evidence); State v. Chapple, 135 Ariz. 281, 660 P.2d 1208 (1983) (reversing and
remanding for new trial)).
