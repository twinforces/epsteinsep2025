Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government, with consent of defense counsel, respectfully requests that the
Court allow the parties to arrange for the provision of secure high-speed wired Internet
access in the courtroom in connection with trial in the above-captioned matter. The secure
Internet connection will enable the trial teams in the courtroom to stay connected to their
online case repositories and resources during critical moments of the proceedings. This
will facilitate the effective and efficient presentation of evidence. In addition, the parties
will be able to reduce the files they bring into the courtroom, as well as the traffic to and
from the courtroom during proceedings. Although the parties understand that the
courtroom also has Wi-Fi access, which is available for use, a high-speed wired connection
ensures a faster internet connection and will avoid connectivity issues.

Subject to the Court’s approval, the parties will retain Courtroom Connect to
provide these services. Courtroom Connect does not require any court resources to provide
service and currently maintains a network in the courthouse that is 100% independent of
the Court’s internal network. Set up, installation and service fees will be paid for by the
parties at no cost to the Court.

Other trials in federal courts have utilized a high-speed connection to the Internet
in the courtroom, including United States v. Gatto, 17 Cr. 686 (LAK). The following
describes how Courtroom Connect restricts access to the network and ensures compliance
with court security and directives:

¢ The network will be a hard-wired, secure physical network connection
utilizing a firewall and other security provisions.
