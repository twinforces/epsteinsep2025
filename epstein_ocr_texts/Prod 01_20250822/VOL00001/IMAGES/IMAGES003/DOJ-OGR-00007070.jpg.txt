1 the other individual. Watson, 640 F.3d, 511-12.

2 Other courts in this Circuit have described challenges
3 to the thoroughness of the investigation as a "common method of
4 undermining a prosecution" by, for example, cross-examining

5 officers on which leads they followed and which they did not.

6 See, for example, Gray v. Ercole —-— I don't have that full

19 289, 2019 WL 2210663 (S.D.N.Y. 2019); see also, United States
20 V. Aleynikov, 785 F.Supp.2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).
21 The other two cases the defense cites, neither of
22 which is binding on the Court, don't suggest anything different
23 than the law I just referred to. In Bowen v. Maynard, the 10th
24 Circuit held that Brady evidence in the government's possession
25 was material because it suggested that another likely suspect
