Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document528 Filed 12/06/21 Page5of8

to divulge their conversations with counsel about: how'significant their attorneys assess the benefits
In such cases, it is not:that:these issues are irrelevant to the Government. or to the defense.
They are: highly relevant. But the: attorney-client communications are privileged, and. the
attorney’s advice is not. presumptively expected, to be shared with the Government, because. the
witness ‘will testify for the Goverriment. Instead, the client :makes factual statements about the:
issuc—not: about: the attorney-client. communications—which the: Government. turns over to the
defense. See, ¢.g..Jn re General Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litig.,. 80 F. Supp. 30.521, 528
(S.D.N-Y. 2015) (“It is well established, however, that the attorncy-clicnt privilege. protects
disclosed to others: docs ‘not, by: itself, create the factual. inference that the communications were
not intended to: be:confidential. at the time they were made.” Jd. at 529 (emphasis in original,
internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, it, would have been, improper for the Government.
to ask. Jane how Glassman. had advised, her regarding her decision whether to assist the
Government.”
Second, Glassman did, not waive any ‘privilege over Janc’s communications with him,
through his comments’ to the Govertiment. The. reason is that Jane, not Glassman, was. holder of

the privilege, and it:was not Glassman’s to‘waive. See Jn re von Bulow, 828 F.2d.at 100. And.

United States v. Bergonzi, 216 F:R.D.487 (N.D. Cal. 2003), on. which the defendant relies (Def.
Letter at 3), is,inapposite. In that case, a Company agreed to turn over certain documents to the
Government “before the documents had been. prepared.” Jd. at 493. Accordingly, the company
could:not assert privilege over the documents, because they:were made “for the purpose of'relaying
communication. to a third. party. » Jd. There is no reason to believe that: Glassman’s legal advice:
to Jane was ‘made'with the intent to turn over thai legal: advice to the Government.
