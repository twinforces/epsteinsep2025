enforcement officers identified by the defense as experts and will not elicit expert testimony from
them. Those witnesses are being called as fact witnesses to describe, for instance, the execution

partner in the narcotics distribution conspiracy. Garcia, 413 F.3d at 216. That is distinguishable
from cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in
certain investigative steps.
4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case
agents (Def. Mot. 10 at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”
(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony. The Government has moved to
preclude the defense from offering such evidence, including by calling the case agents identified
in its Touhy notice. (See Gov’t Motions in Limine Section III). Accordingly, if the defense plans
to call case agents for such testimony—which the Court should preclude—the defense must
provide expert notice of such testimony.
