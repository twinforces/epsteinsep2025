the package did not match the item. Simply stated, the evidence collection and retention in this
matter is an unreliable mess.

A. Message Pads

The Government contends that various message pads were seized from different locations
by the Palm Beach Police Department and appears to intend to offer hundreds of the messages as
evidence at trial. See, e.g., Government Exhibits 1 through 4-K. Many of the alleged messages
are undated, un-signed, contain various hearsay statements that do not appear to be relevant to
this case, are outside the applicable time frame alleged in the indictment.

B. “CPU’s,” “Zip CD’s,” “CD’s,” and “Flash Cards”

The search warrant inventory identifies numerous electronic storage devices as having
been seized. However, no actual inventory of the alleged contents of these drives appears to have
been prepared by anyone in the Palm Beach Police Department. The items were not identified by
hard drive name or number or photo. Accordingly, there exists no way for anyone to accurately
identify what content may have been on any particular device and how that device may or may
not relate to any issue in this case.

C. Photos

The inventory also lists the seizure of “Photos.” Many of the photos are not identified
with any particularity.

and Personal Knowledge

Evidence may be authenticated through direct or circumstantial proof. United States v.
Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d 139, 172 (2d Cir. 2008)). “The chain of custody is ordinarily a method of
authentication for physical evidence.” United States v. Gelzer, 50 F.3d 1133, 1140 (2d Cir.
