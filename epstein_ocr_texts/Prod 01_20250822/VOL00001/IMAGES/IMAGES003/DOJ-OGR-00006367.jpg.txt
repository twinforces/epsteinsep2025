Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 438 Filed 11/12/21 Page 7 of54

“TT here is no absolute right of an accused to have a jury hear a witness’s true name and
address.” Clark v. Ricketts, 958 F.2d 851, 855 (9th Cir. 1991). Strong public interests support
limiting public disclosure of victim identities and other sensitive information. The Crime
Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, requires district courts to implement procedures to
ensure that crime victims are accorded, among other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably
protected from the accused,” and “[t]he right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the
victim’s dignity and privacy.” Jd. §§ (a)(1), (a)(8). Moreover, the public “has a strong interest in
protecting the identities of sexual assault victims so that other victims will not be deterred from
reporting such crimes.” Doe on behalf of Doe No. 1 v. Nygard, No. 20 Civ. 6501 (ER), 2020 WL
4890427, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2020) (quoting Doe No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 195
(E.D.N.Y. 2006)).

These interests are particularly salient in sex abuse cases. Victims in such cases often
testify or are referred to only using pseudonyms or without using their last names. See Aug. 3,
2021 Tr. at 53:13-55:2, United States v. Kelly, No. 19 Cr. 286 (E.D.N.Y.); Oct. 17, 2019 Tr. at
32:1-36:6, United States v. Dupigny, No. 18 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.) Dkt. No. 198 (permitting
use of real first names and fake last names); Order at 10-11, United States v. Kidd, No. 18 Cr.
872 (VM) (S.D.N.Y. July 1, 2019), Dkt. No. 60 (“The Court is persuaded that, to protect the
minor victims, they should be permitted to testify under pseudonyms and that such anonymous
testimony does not violate Kidd’s Sixth Amendment rights.”); May 8, 2019 Tr. at 6:20-21,
United States v. Benjamin, No. 18 Cr. 874 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 53; Order at 29-35, United
States v. Raniere, No. 18 Cr. 204 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y. May 6, 2019), Dkt. No. 622; United States v.
