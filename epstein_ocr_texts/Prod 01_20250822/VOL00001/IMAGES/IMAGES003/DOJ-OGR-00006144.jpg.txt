Indictment.
as repetitive
Let me remind you that #he-defesdantMs. Maxwell is on trial only for committing acts
alleged in the Indictment. Accordingly, you may not consider this evidence of similar acts as a
substitute for proof that the-defeadentMs. Maxwell committed the crimes charged. Nor may you
| consider this evidence as proof that adefeadentMs. Maxwell has a criminal personality or bad
character. The evidence of the other, similar acts was admitted for a much more limited purpose
and you may consider it only for that limited purpose.
| If you determine that the defendantMs. Maxwell committed the acts charged in the
Indictment and the similar acts as well, then you may, but you need not draw an inference that in
| doing the acts charged in the Indictment, that defendant Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly and
intentionally and not because of some mistake, accident, or other innocent reasons. You may
| also consider this evidence in determining whether +he-defendentMs. Maxwell utilized a
common scheme or plan in committing both the crimes charged in the Indictment and the similar
acts introduced by the Government.
Evidence of similar acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose.
| Specifically, you may not consider it as evidence that the-defendentMs. Maxwell is of bad
character or has the propensity to commit crimes.
