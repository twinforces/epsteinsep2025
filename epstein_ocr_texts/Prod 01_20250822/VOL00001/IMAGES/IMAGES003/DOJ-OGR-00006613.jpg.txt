and forensic psychology. She has written, presented, and taught about the assessment and

board of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is

Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,
and research to the following: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by
perpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of
manipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,
rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic pattern
of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the
victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and attachment
with their abuser. The relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from being aware
that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may
not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the
consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the
likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological
consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other
individuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that
nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for
a variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted
by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not
evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer
Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.

Dr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological
trauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s
extensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in
childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological
evaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is
producing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.

notice under Rule 16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert
witness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that
