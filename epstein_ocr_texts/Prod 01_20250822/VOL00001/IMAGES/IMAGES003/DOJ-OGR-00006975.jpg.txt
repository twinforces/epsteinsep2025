9 Another preliminary matter, as I indicated in my
10 order, Dkt. No. 344, I will ensure access to this proceeding
11 and all proceedings in the case for alleged victims as well as
12 for family members of Ms. Maxwell, and the District Executive's

15 coordinated with the victim coordinator unit in the U.S.
16 Attorney's Office to ensure access for any alleged victims who
17 wish to be present.
18 My thanks to the D.E.'S Office for facilitating those

25 been working hard with the folks in the clerk's office, the
