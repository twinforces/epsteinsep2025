Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 441 Filed 11/12/21 Page10of12
willfully violated the Order and has refused to produce statements that it obviously (1) is aware
of and (2) could be easily identified by referring to a discovery page number or simply providing
the statement.

Ms. Maxwell had a very narrow window of time to review and consider any alleged co-
conspirator statements which has expired. Counsel for Ms. Maxwell are concurrently preparing
multiple motions in limine, reviewing thousands of pages of newly provided discovery material,
addressing other pretrial deadlines, and preparing for trial. At this stage the failure of the
government to address a very simple disclosure requirement has prejudiced Ms. Maxwellâ€™s
ability to prepare for trial and impacts her statutory and constitutional rights to a fair and speedy
trial, due process, and effective assistance of counsel. The appropriate remedy is preclusion of
the purported statements.
