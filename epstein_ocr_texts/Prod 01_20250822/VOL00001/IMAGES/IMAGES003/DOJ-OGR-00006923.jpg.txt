Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 453 Filed 11/12/21 Page 43 of 52

(S.D:N.Y. May 1, 2007) (defendant's prior narcotics and firearm transactions with the same
confidential informant not “inextricably intertwined” with the charged, narcotics Conspiracy; even
though the conduct:was “generally similar to the conduct-underlying the offenses charged in.the:
indictment”); Whited.States'v:, Nektalov, 825 F. Supp. 2d.367, 369-70 (S.D:N-Y.. 2004) (prior
similat moncy' laundering transactions between defendant and.cooperating:witiess not.
“inextricably-intertwined” with the charged.money laundering ‘offense ‘or “necessary to complete
the story” of the charged conspiracy. (emphasis in original)).

Testimony concerning’ the alleged rape. should also be excluded because the S2
Indictment contains no allegations of rape and such testimony is therefore ‘irrelevant to the
charged. crimes. The government dismisses this:point arguing that. indictments do ‘not. need to
include all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual. activity” and.“commercial sex
act” are broad ecnough.to cover rape. See Resp. at 80. But;this misses thepoint. ‘The rape
illegal because the alleged:victims were under the age of consent. The indictment:does not
charge any crimes that are ‘premised. on, sex acts, that; involve the use of force, like rape. For:
example, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See: S2' Ind. 44 22-27. But.they
do not.charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was cffeeted by
means of force, threats of force, ‘fraud, or coercion.” 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1). The government is
therefore off base when its:states that. “evidence of rape, where it occurs. ... is the core: conduct in.
the case.” Resp.'at 81; Itis only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges
jorcible scx acts. Indeed, the cases, cited by the government prove'this point: See Ex. E,

with sex trafficking conspiracy “effected by means of force” under ‘18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1))5
