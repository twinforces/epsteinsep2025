1 well take that up at sidebar in a moment. And as I said, only
2 if the jurors indicated a specific wish to speak not in public
3 because the answer would embarrass them or otherwise seriously
4 compromise their privacy, other than that, we'll proceed in

5 open court. But with respect to those, I'm doing that to

6 ensure juror candor and honesty and ultimately ensure the

7 selection of a fair and impartial jury.

8 Process-wise, during the questioning, as the juror is
9 answering my questions in the voir dire, if I think a juror

10 answers in away that would require striking for cause, I'll

11 ask counsel whether they have any objection. Meaning do you

12 have any objection to me striking for cause. Assuming no

13 objection, then I will strike that juror for cause, and they'll
14 be excused and we'll give them instructions.

15 If I don't think that any answer requires a striking
16 for cause before we get to the individual questions at the end
17 of the voir dire, I'll ask counsel if they have specific

18 followup. If you have specific followup, I'll hear you at

19 sidebar, that is, outside the hearing of the juror, consider
20 your request for followup, and then either engage in that
21 followup or not, and proceed apace.
22 If we have a juror for whom there is no basis to
23 strike for cause, at that point, we'll proceed to have them
24 respond to the individual questions in the voir dire. And then
25 they won't be struck, so they'll be given instructions on
