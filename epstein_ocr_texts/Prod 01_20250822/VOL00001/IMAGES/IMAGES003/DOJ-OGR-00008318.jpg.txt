1 opening.

2 MS. COMEY: Precisely, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: OK.

4 Defense, any objection to me including, in pre-opening
5 preliminary instructions, what I determine is an appropriate

6 instruction regarding witnesses testifying under pseudonyms?

7 MS. STERNHEIM: No.

8 THE COURT: Thank you.

9 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. There was just one
10 more issue that I believe Ms. Moe was going to address.

11 THE COURT: Thank you. Ms. Moe.

12 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. I'm going to bring
13 to the Court's attention an issue that came to our attention

14 regarding prospective Juror No. 93. We learned, following voir
15 dire, based on publicly available information, that that

16 prospective juror is an attorney at a financial institution.

17 At trial, there will be a witness from that financial

18 institution. He is more than a records custodian in the sense
19 that he is an executive director at that financial institution.
20 And he'll be talking about certain financial transactions.
al During our meetings with this witness, an attorney for
22 the financial institution had been present along with outside
23 counsel for the financial institution.
24 So we want to just bring that to the Court's
25 attention. We flagged that for the defense as well.
