Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document398 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 24 of 52

But that’s not what the government does. Instead, right after claiming that “[c]linical
psychologists are not so credulous,” the government essentially says to Ms. Maxwell, “How dare
you?” In the government’s words, “The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim
that Dr. Rocchio has been misled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for
traumatic events that did not occur.” Resp. at 16.

In this way, and in one breath, the government attests that Rocchio is “not so credulous.”
But in the next breath, the government asks this Court to assume that Rocchio “has [not] been
misled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did
not occur.” In other words, the government asks this Court to assume Rocchio’s patients are
telling the truth, just as Rocchio does. Apparently Rocchio is “so credulous.” But there is no
reason this Court should be.

The government next notes that the term “grooming-by-proxy” “appears nowhere in the
Government’s expert notice.” Resp. at 26. That’s hardly surprising, though, because there is no
reliable way to assess or analyze if one individual “grooming” a minor to facilitate abuse by
someone else, even though that is exactly what the government says Ms. Maxwell did.

As detailed today is Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 412 motion, the Indictment alleges “grooming”
or “normalization” of sexual behavior by Ms. Maxwell over a dozen times. The government does
not, however, contend that Ms. Maxwell “groomed” anyone for her own benefit; instead, the
government contends that she “groomed” them for Epstein’s benefit. But as the government does
not dispute, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study, nothing—to validate
Rocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy (even if she doesn’t use that phrase).°

° The articles and cases the government cites involve alleged grooming behavior by the preparator
of the abuse, not alleged grooming behavior by a third party.
