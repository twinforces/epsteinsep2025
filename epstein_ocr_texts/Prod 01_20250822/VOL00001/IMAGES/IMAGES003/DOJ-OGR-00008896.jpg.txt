obviously’ will be readirig, the Defense Motion prior to any hearing. The defendant has cited iio
pre-trial, Ict alone ‘post-trial, bricfing."

In sum, L:ugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in.seeret until all
factfinding in a, case is completed. Were that, true, cases in, this District would frequently be
litigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relicf sought by the defendant—sealing
of a document with. significant publicly available information—is ‘not narrowly tailored and,
therefore, is inconsistent with'the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in. Lugosch.”

The Government additionally notes that ‘the. same arguments. apply ‘with equal force-to the
Government’s opposition ‘bricf, in, which the only items marked for redaction are references to
sealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding ‘portions of the juror questionnaires.
These. proposed redactions arc :narrowly tailored to protect the. privacy interests of prospective
jurors and are consistent ‘with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered. in, scaling the
transcripts, they'contain private information of thosejurors. Sée, ¢.g...Press-Enter. Co.'v. Superior
Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. S01, 511-12 (1984). Accordingly, the Government
respectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions, to the Government’s opposition,
bricf:

' The defendant’s attempt.to cquate its: post-trial motion. with. a eriminal, investigation. in which it
serves as the prosecutor is: meritless. This is not a.criminal investigation, as this Court has already
made clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (foting that any‘ inquiry is under the strict supervision and
control of the court). And. the:defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings ‘merely
serves to highlight the ‘Second Circuit?s concern, about ‘how such, inquiries ‘have the “evil
consequences” of, ‘among’ other ‘things, “subjecting jurics to harassment.” United. States vy:
Tanniéllo, 866 F.2d 540, 543 (2d Cir. 1989).

* While, thie defendant. claims, that it would be “too difficult. or itnpractical” to redact the Defense

Motion (Def. Letter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout me course of this

Motion 4 is ‘not. ‘exceptional.
