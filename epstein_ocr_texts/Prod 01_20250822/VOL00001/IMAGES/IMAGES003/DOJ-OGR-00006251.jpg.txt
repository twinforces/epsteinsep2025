Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 _ Filed 11/08/21 Page 40of41

docs not share the defense’s view of the law, to the’ extent the Court, accepts that view. Dr. Loftus
and Dr. Dietz should be exéluded.as well.

This point is valid in.a number of respects, but three in particular. bear noting. -First, the:
defense.criticizes Dr. Rocchio in, the strongest terms, ‘for opining about principles that. “have no
associated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 1, 7,.8, 12, 15; SeéEx..A.at 3-4), Neither Dit Loftus nor
Dr. Dictz identify an error rate for a.single one of their opinions, much, less all. of'them. Second,
the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot: be reliably. applied bya jury because she
describes phenomena that occur reliably: in.her practice and the literature, but she:does:not specify
how often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, 10, 16 (“Roechio claims grooming ‘often,’ or ‘frequently occurs”
without providing the jury any explanation of howto, decide whether grooming: actually occurred.
inthis case.”)). The same could.be:said for Dr. Loftus-and:Dr. Dictz. (See-Ex. A atl. (“[Dr.:Loftus]
will, describe scientific rescarch ‘showing that: false :memorics. can. be: described, with, confidence,
detail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at'7 (“False allegations of
sexual.assault do occur .....”)). Third, the defense argues that‘Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory:
and disclosure of traumatic and ‘abusive, events is impacted by a number of factors, including the
circumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so: gencric:as to'be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3:at 17).
That opinion is no morc gencric than the opinion that false memories can be “ercated.as.a:result of
post-event information and. occurrences, suggestion, influence, orthe like.” (Ex..A.at.2).

In. the Government’s view, the defense’s view jin. its Dawhert motion is unnecessarily
cramped, and cach expert; opinion’s reliability can, be tested individually. But given the defense’s
view of Daihert and. its progeny, if'Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are .cxcluded based on, the defense’s

arguments, Dr. Loftus and. Dr. Dictz'should'be excluded as well.
