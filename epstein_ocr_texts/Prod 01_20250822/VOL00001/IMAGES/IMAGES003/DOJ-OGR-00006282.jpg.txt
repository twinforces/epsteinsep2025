that occurred while he or she was under the influence or while experienc-
ing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may attempt to make
sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events
that occurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize
what memories are intact, a person may confabulate or fill in the memory
lapses with events that seem probable or which for some reason they come
to believe “must have” taken place. For example, waking up naked but not
remembering how his or her clothes were removed, a person may conclude
that someone else removed the clothes without his or her consent, even
if the individual had, while intoxicated, actually removed his or her own
clothes without remembering having done so. In addition, some drugs can
artificially affect sexual interest (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine) or modify the indi-
vidual’s normal disinhibitions regarding sexuality that can affect the analysis
of sexual consent. Thus, an individual may not normally have been sexually
interested or may typically have been more sexually inhibited and not given
consent. She may come to be puzzled after a sexual interaction and con-
clude that she was sexually assaulted because her behavior did not fit with
her expectations.
Antisocial Personality Disorder (or Conduct Disorder
in Adolescents)
The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) explains the essen-
tial feature of antisocial personality disorder as “a pervasive pattern or
disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in early child-
hood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.” Diagnostic criteria
consist of the following:
1. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as
indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;
2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning
others for personal profit or pleasure;
3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;
4, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or
assaults;
5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;
6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain
consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations; and
7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing
having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.
Diagnostic criteria 1, 2, 4, and 7 are of particular importance in this
pathway. If an individual with antisocial personality disorder is likely to lie
