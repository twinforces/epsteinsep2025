Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 452 Filed 11/12/21 Page 60 of 84

The defense errs when it suggests that the Court ordered the Government to specifically
itemize any co-conspirator statements contained in its disclosures. When the Court first set a
disclosure schedule for Jencks Act material, it adopted the “Government’s proposal,” which
opposed any requirement that the Government isolate co-conspirator statements from other witness
statements. (Order at 1, Dkt. No. 297). When the Court ordered the Government to produce the
identities of co-conspirators, it again ordered the Government to “disclose” all co-conspirator
statements, citing the Court’s earlier order. (Order at 2, Dkt. No. 335). Neither order expressly
directed the Government to produce a set of co-conspirator statements it would offer at trial
separately from the other evidence it would offer at trial.

A requirement to “disclose statements” is not a requirement to isolate statements. For one,
the Court denied the defense request for effectively that relief in the first round of pretrial motions.
(Op. & Order at 30-31, Dkt. No. 207). For another, in the defense’s many rounds of briefing on
this issue, it has cited no case—not from this District, nor any other—in which a Court ordered the
Government to segregate and itemize co-conspirator statements from other statements for the
convenience of the defense. The Government is aware of no such case—likely because such an
order would be in considerable tension with Circuit precedent, see In re U.S., 834 F.2d at 286. For
a third, the guiding principle of the defense’s justification for its request is to facilitate litigation
of those statements’ admissibility pre-trial. But the law of the Second Circuit is that such
statements can be conditionally admitted during the trial, and their admissibility litigated
thereafter. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, 676 F.3d 260, 273 n.8 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing United
States v. Geaney, 417 F.2d 1116, 1120 (2d Cir. 1969)); Op. & Order at 30, Dkt. No. 207. As much
