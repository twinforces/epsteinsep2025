(i) the item is within the defendant’s possession, custody, or control;
and

(ii) the defendant intends'to use the item in the defendant’s case-in-
chief at trial.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).

Under subsection (b)(1,)(A)(ii), a.defendant’s reciprocal, discovery’ obligations arc limited
‘to matcrial=spcecifically books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects,
buildings or places, or copies. or portions of:any of these items—that she intends to use in her
“case-in-chief.”

In. turn, a'party’s “case-in-chicf” includes only “(t]he evidence presented at trial by a
party between the time the party:calls the: first witness and the time the party rests.” Black’s Law
Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)..By definition, therefore, a defendant’s “‘case-in-chief” does not
inéludé her cross-cxamination of'a prosecution Witness during the government’s “casé-in-chicf.”

Here, Ms. Maxwell has not:called her first witness. Only the government has called

‘witnesses. The case is currently inthe governments “case-in-chicf,” and Ms. Maxwell’s “case-
‘in-chicf” has not.yct started. Because. Ms.. Maxwell. has:not begun her case-in-chicf, she had no
obligation under Rule 16(b)(1)(A) to disclose the’photograph. she offered in evidence while
cross-examining Jane.

There is no doubt-Rule 16(b)(1)(A) does not-apply to material a defendant offers into
evidence, while :cross-examining witnesses during the government’s case-in-chicf. The 1974
Committee: Notes.to Rule 16 say this expressly: “Subdivision (b)(1)(A) provides that the
defendant:shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he‘has in his‘possession,
custody, or control and:which he intends to introduce in evidence in-his case in chief.’ Fed. R.

Crim. P. 16, Committee Notes:to 1974 Amendment.
