LB1 5MAX2:

MR. PAGLIUCA: Yés, your Honor. That's fine.

THE COURT: Thank. you.,

Defendants 2 is the admission, of Gertdin evidence
outlined in the government's 404(b) letter dated October 11,

2021. First, as to the défense argument that ‘there has been arn

inadequate notice under 404(b), IL disagree because the

government.'s letter and briefing between the government's

letter and the briefing here, the defendant has “reasonable

notice" of any 404(b) evidence so 'the question is, whether 'the

evidence can be properly admitted. IL think there is two

categories of evidence, the first goes to e=mails, and I will

appropriate. The government may Have, attempted to redact some
general description and, to. the extent that you, have, I disagree
with that. but. I will speak génerally == I'm sdérry, the defense

requested redaction as to some general description, but I don't

think it'S appropriate. So I''m going to ask the government, if
this understanding is correct, that the e-mails reflect
instances of the defendant setting up dates that involve women
over the age of consent.

MS. MOE: Your Hénor, I think as we noted in our
briefing, for some of the documents it ds unclear what the age
range 15.

THE COURT: So you wouldn't be able to prove that it,
was under the age of comsent?
