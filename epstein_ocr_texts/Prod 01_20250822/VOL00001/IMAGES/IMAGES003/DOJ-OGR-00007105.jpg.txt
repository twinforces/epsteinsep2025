1 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. That's fine.

2 THE COURT: Thank you.

3 Defendants 2 is the admission of certain evidence

4 outlined in the government's 404(b) letter dated October 11,

S 2021. First, as to the defense argument that there has been an
6 inadequate notice under 404(b), I disagree because the

7 government's letter and briefing between the government's

8 letter and the briefing here, the defendant has "reasonable

9 notice" of any 404(b) evidence so the question is whether the
10 evidence can be properly admitted. I think there is two

11 categories of evidence, the first goes to e-mails, and I will
12 speak in the just general description which I think is

13 appropriate. The government may have attempted to redact some
14 general description and to the extent that you have, I disagree
15 with that but I will speak generally -- I'm sorry, the defense
16 requested redaction as to some general description but I don't
17 think it's appropriate. So I'm going to ask the government, if
18 this understanding is correct, that the e-mails reflect

19 instances of the defendant setting up dates that involve women
20 over the age of consent.
21 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think as we noted in our
22 briefing, for some of the documents it is unclear what the age
23 range is.
24 THE COURT: So you wouldn't be able to prove that it
25 was under the age of consent?
