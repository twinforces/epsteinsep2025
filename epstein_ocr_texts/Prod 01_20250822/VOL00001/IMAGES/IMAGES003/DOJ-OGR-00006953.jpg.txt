Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in support of the admission of certain
statements by the defendant’s co-conspirators at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence
801(d)(2)(E). Consistent with the Court’s directives at the November 1, 2021 conference in this
case, the Government has provided the defense with categories of co-conspirator statements it
intends to offer at trial, as well as examples of particular statements within each category. After
conferral, the defense indicated that, subject to certain clarifications, it would not object to the
majority of the proffered statements. The defense further indicated that it objected to a particular
subset of the Government’s proffered statements. For the reasons set forth below, the Court should
admit these statements at trial.

A. The Proffered Statements

The Government identified four categories of statements by co-conspirators of the
defendant that the Government may seek to admit at trial: (1) statements made by Epstein to friends
and family of Minor Victims; (2) statements made by Epstein to his employees; (3) statements
made by a co-conspirator to the Minor Victims or their families; and (4) statements made by
