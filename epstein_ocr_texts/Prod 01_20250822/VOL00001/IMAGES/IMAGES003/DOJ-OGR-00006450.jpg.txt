the Second Court explained, was to allow for such statements to be admitted "substantively as
well," rather than as non-substantive rehabilitation. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,
705-06 (2d. Cir. 2019) (amendment "extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that
rebut other attacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory")
(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2014 cases, prior consistent
statements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any
such evidence will now be admitted substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of
admitting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain applicable post-2014.

B. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements

The question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are
admissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at 19
(government "intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'
prior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein")
(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or
the specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the
defense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the
admissibility pre-trial. Rule 801(d)(1)(B)'s amendment in 2014 did not alter the landscape so
much that any attack on the accusers’ credibility will allow any prior consistent statement.
Important limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.

If the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent
fabrication or improper motive under Rule 801(d)(1)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the
evidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 156 (1995), still apply.
In particular, the government must show proof that the motive for fabrication or improper
purpose arose after the purported statement. In Zome, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the
