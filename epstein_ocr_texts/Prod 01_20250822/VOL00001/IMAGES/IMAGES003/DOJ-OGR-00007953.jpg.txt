1 talking about any event, there are general principles of

2 memory, and those would apply to memory, general well-accepted
3 principles of memory, that would apply to experiences of sexual
4 abuse as well.

5) So to the extent that we know everybody pays attention
6 to and attaches significance to some aspects of an event more

7 so than others, what a sexual abuse survivor discloses and the
8 pieces of the story that they -- or their experiences, I'm

9 sorry -- that they remember are going to be those things that
10 were central details. They are going to have relatively good
11 memory most of the time for the gist of the event and for the
12 details that they attended to and were most significant to

13 them. But their memory for peripheral details, we know, can

14 fade away and weaken or change with time.

15 Q. You just mentioned peripheral details. What do you mean by
16 that?

17 A. So in the memory literature, again, there is often a

18 distinction made between what are considered to be central

19 details and peripheral details. So the central details are
20 subjectively defined as whatever it is an individual is paying
21 attention to and attaching significance to at the time of an
22 event. And those are the details that get encoded in memory
23 and are then later available for retrieval at the time of
24 recall.
25 Q. Can you give an example.
