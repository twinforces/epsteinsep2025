Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

The government contends that Ms. Maxwell should be precluded from admitting into
evidence a photograph offered while cross-examining Jane during the government’s case-in-
chief. The government says that Ms. Maxwell did not disclose the photograph as part of her
reciprocal discovery obligations, thereby violating Rule 16(b)(1)(A). The government is wrong.

The language of Rule 16(b)(1)(A) is plain and unambiguous: Its reciprocal discovery
obligations apply only to material Ms. Maxwell intends to use during her “case-in-chief.” The
Rule says:

(b) Defendant’s Disclosure.

(1) Information Subject to Disclosure.
(A) Documents and Objects. If a defendant requests disclosure
under Rule 16(a)(1)(E) and the government complies, then the
defendant must permit the government, upon request, to inspect and
to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs,
tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of
these items if:
