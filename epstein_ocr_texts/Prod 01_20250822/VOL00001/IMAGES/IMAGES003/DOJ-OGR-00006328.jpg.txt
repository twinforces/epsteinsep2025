Dear Judge Nathan:

The government’s opposition to releasing Ghislaine Maxwell from. pretrial detention
(Dkt. 423) is a long-winded regurgitation of prior writings and rulings and,tnderscores its
determination-to ignore:the: presumption. of innocence and. punish Ms. Maxwell pretrial. for her
association. with Jeffrey Epstein. The ‘indictment against her federalizes a,New York State B
misdemeanor which:carrics,a maximum penalty of 90 days. ‘Ms. Maxwell, who awaits trial, has
served that five times over. Ms. Maxwell is not, and has:never been, a flight risk. At ‘every
opportunity, Ms. Maxwell_has vigorously asserted her innocence and her cagerness to face these
‘unsubstantiated charges ‘in court. She should be allowed to do so outside of the confines of the
MDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial,
negatively impact:her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.

The Court now:has the:3500 material. and Giglio material. which.scriously undermine the
strength of the goyvernment’s, case ‘and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the
government cannot and. doés. not ¢ven,attcmpt to refuté. ‘Rather, the government urges the Court
recent disclosures. The Court. and defense now: have the! witness statements, and they’ scriously

‘call into question prior rulings based'on the purported strength of'the government’s case.
