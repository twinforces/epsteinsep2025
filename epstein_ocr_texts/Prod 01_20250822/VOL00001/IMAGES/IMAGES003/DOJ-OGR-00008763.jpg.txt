Instruction No. 40: Venue

‘With-respect, to ‘each of the ‘counts jin, the indictment, you:must also consider the issue of

‘vente, namely, whether any act:in furtherance of the unlawful activity charged ‘in'that: count

occurred within the Southern District.of New: York. The: Southern District of New York:
encompasses the following counties: New’ York; County (i.e., Manhattan), Bronx, Westchester,
Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties. Anything-that.occurs in any of
those places occurs :in the Southern District: of New: York.

‘Venue must be examined separately for each count.in the Indictment. Venue on one:
count does not establish venue on.another count, though. if applicable, you may: rely:on the same.
evidence to establish venue on, multiple counts.

‘On: the issue of venue=and this alone=the Government need not, prove venue beyond a
reasonable doubt, but only by:a mere preponderance of the evidence. A.“preponderance: of the:

evidence” means more likely than not. Thus, the Government, which.does bear the burden of

‘proving venue, has, satisfied that burden as:to venue if you conclude that it is moré likely than not

that:some act in. furtherance of each.charged offense occurred inthe Southern District of New

‘York. If, on, the other hand, you find that the Government has failed. to prove the venue:

‘Tequirement.as to a particular offense, then you must acquit Ms. Maxwell ofthat offense, even if

all the other elements of the offense are proven.
