THE COURT: ‘WHO am I) Hearing from on this one?
MR, EVERDELL: Me, your Honor, Thank. you, your Honor.
I think your Honor hitt it right on the head right ‘from

the outset, which is if all we had were allegations related to

this particular ‘individual, we wotild not have a charged crime

here because there was no criminal activity at all.
THe only basis for which -- I thimk the government has

tried to articulate some basis for its relevance as direct

evidence of thé charged crimes is, her subjective experience of

what happened to her. She was ‘of legal age in every single

jurisdiction where these events allegedly took place. So the

Lssue of consent, while we may have moral. objections to this,

it was entirely legal and the government Gan't prove S6therwise,

So. all she's going to ‘testify to, presumably, is how she felt.
about. these instances, and that is hot proof that is probative
of the defendant's guilt of these charges.

Moreover, your Hénor, it 1S quite inflammatory and
misleads the jury to hear when, someone feels a certain, way what
happened to hér, even though legally it ddéésn't make a
difference, that is going to encourage them to feel sympathy

for her and convict the defendant potentially on a false grourid

because there is no illegal conduct hene.
Your Honor, I think the government has articulated or

ak least tried to articulate at the Court,'s urging a basis why

this may be direct evidence of the sex trafficking conspiracy.
