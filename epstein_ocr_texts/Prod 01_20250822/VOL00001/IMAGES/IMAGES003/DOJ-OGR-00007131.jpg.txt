1 THE COURT: Who am I hearing from on this one?

2 MR. EVERDELL: Me, your Honor. Thank you, your Honor.
3 I think your Honor hit it right on the head right from
4 the outset, which is if all we had were allegations related to
iy this particular individual, we would not have a charged crime

6 here because there was no criminal activity at all.

7 The only basis for which -â€”- I think the government has
8 tried to articulate some basis for its relevance as direct

9 evidence of the charged crimes is her subjective experience of
10 what happened to her. She was of legal age in every single

11 jurisdiction where these events allegedly took place. So the
12 issue of consent, while we may have moral objections to this,
13 it was entirely legal and the government can't prove otherwise.
14 So all she's going to testify to, presumably, is how she felt
15 about those instances, and that is not proof that is probative
16 of the defendant's guilt of these charges.

17 Moreover, your Honor, it is quite inflammatory and

18 misleads the jury to hear when someone feels a certain way what
19 happened to her, even though legally it doesn't make a
20 difference, that is going to encourage them to feel sympathy
21 for her and convict the defendant potentially on a false ground
22 because there is no illegal conduct here.
23 Your Honor, I think the government has articulated or
24 at least tried to articulate at the Court's urging a basis why
25 this may be direct evidence of the sex trafficking conspiracy.
