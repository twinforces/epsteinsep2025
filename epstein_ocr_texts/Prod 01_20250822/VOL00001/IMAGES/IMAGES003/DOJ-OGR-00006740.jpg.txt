Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 452 Filed 11/12/21 Page 32 of 84
(Def. Mot. 3 at 16). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked
merely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some
Minor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility
of those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,
including their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor
Victims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio
about various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the
totality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.

The defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed
reporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must
make for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 17). It is unclear how the defendant can simultaneously argue
that (1) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed
reporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would
only help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary
consequence of child sexual abuse (id. at 15-16).

Finally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the
defendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknowledges,
however, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not
evaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at 16 (citing United States v. Charley, 189
F.3d 1251, 1266-67 (10th Cir. 1999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact
abused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).
