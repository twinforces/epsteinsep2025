(Def. Mot. 3 at 16). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury., Jurors are not tasked.
merely ‘with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some:
Minor Victims did. not immediately disclose: their sexual. abuse: ‘When. evaluating the credibility
of those delayed disclosures, they will have, the benefit-of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,
including their cross-cxamination’whieh:is sure to address their-delayed disclosure, and the Minor
Victims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio
about; Various circumstances’ that: may’ lead victims of scxual ‘abuse to, dclay disclosure. In, the
totality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds. credible.

The defendant, also argucs it is prejudicial to her that. Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed.
reporting:is more consistent:with truthfulness than fabrication, a.determination which'the jury must:
make for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 1.7). Jt is unclear how the defendant can simultancously argue:
that (1): Dr. Roechio’s testimony improperly assumes the role ofthe jury by suggesting that delayed,
reporting.is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (/d.); and (2).Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would
consequence of child sexual abuse’ (fd: at.'15=16).

Finally,, according to. the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments ‘will only prejudice the
defendant, because it'will scrve to bolster thewitnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknowledges,
however, Dr. Rocchio will not offer.an opinion régarding any. specific victim, and she has not.
evaluated. any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3. at.16 (citing United Statesv. Charley, 189
F.3d 1251, 1266-67 (10th Cir. 1999), in, which the expert: opined that: the victims were im fact:

abused based “largely on, crediting ‘the. girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).
