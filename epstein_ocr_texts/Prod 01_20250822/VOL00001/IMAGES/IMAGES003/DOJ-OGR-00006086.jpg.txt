Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — First Element

The first element of Count Two which the government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt is that the-defendantMs. Maxwell knowingly persuaded or induced or enticed er-ceerced-
andndividual[Jane Doe-1 pseudonym] to travel in interstate or foreign-commerce; namely from
Florida to New York, as alleged in the Indictment. The terms “persuaded,” “induced,” and_
“enticed,” and“coerced” have their ordinary, everyday meanings.

The term “interstate commerce” simply means movement from one state to another. The
term “State” includes a State of the United States and the District of Columbia.

“Knowingly” Defined

| ThedefendantMs. Maxwell must have acted knowingly. An act is done knowingly when it
is done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of accident, mistake, or some other innocent
reason.

Now, knowledge is a matter of inference from the proven facts. Science has not yet
devised a manner of looking into a person’s mind and knowing what that person is thinking.
Whether the defendantMs. Maxwell acted knowingly may be proven by the defendant’sMs.
Maxwell’s conduct and by all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.
