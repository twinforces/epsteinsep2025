Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 452 Filed 11/12/21 Page 77 of 84

consistent. with the rules ‘in, this. exhibit.!? The relevanee of the document, is self-evident: among
other things, it directs cniployées to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 606, at 4): It is
not:prejudicial.as to her “lifestyle”\(Def. Mot. .13 at-3), because the jury will already hear testimony
about her and ‘Epstcin’s various properties, private jet, and,cmployces. And the document is not:
hearsay, becatise the statements are being offered a§ instructions to staff, not’ for the ‘truth of the
matter asserted,

As described above, cach of these exhibits, is highly: relevant, not hearsay: or subject to a.
hearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion.
regarding relevance and Rule 403, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to
‘renew it at trial.

‘VII. ‘There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape

Citing no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants
from referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant:also moves to preclude testimony:
concerning a rape committed, by Jeffrey, Epstcin against.onc of the Minor Victims. ‘Both of these
motions lack merit, and they should be denied.

A. References to Victims

! Hore, and .clsewhere, (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), ‘the, defense, argues that.cvidence that post-
dates the time period of the conspiracy is:irrelevant. That.is incorrect. ‘What. matters is whether
the evidence tends to. make a fact of consequence more or less’probable. If, for instance, there: is
evidence showing'that Epstein’and the defendant were extremely close partners in.2005, that tends
‘to make it more: probable that:they had such a. relationship in 2004, during the time: period : of the
conspiracy. It.is therefore highly’ relevant.
