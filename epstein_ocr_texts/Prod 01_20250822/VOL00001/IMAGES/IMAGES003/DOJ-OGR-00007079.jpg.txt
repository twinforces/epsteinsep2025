Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 465 Filed 11/15/21 Page 28 of 127 28

1 law enforcement is exactly the kind of attack on the

2 thoroughness of the government's investigation that the Fifth
3 Circuit approved in Lindsey v. King. Provided that the rules
4 for admitting prior inconsistent statements are satisfied, the
5 Court concludes that this line of evidence is relevant and

6 admissible.

7 The defense may also cross-examine about witnesses'

8 motives or biases for testifying, including, for example, the
9 witnesses' motives for implicating Ms. Maxwell after Jeffrey
10 Epstein's death. Admitting prior statements on

11 cross-examination may require providing the jury some

12 background information about the prior investigations so that
13 the prior statements are understood in the proper context and
14 the jury is provided necessary background to understand that
15 evidence.
