assault. See Schneider, 2010 WL 3734055, at *2-3 (precluding “grooming” testimony from,
‘psychologist.in prosecution. for traveling in. foreign commerce forthe purpose of engaging in sex
with a minor because psychologist’s “experience in.the field of child.sexual abusers and their.
‘victims is, one-sided, as it is limited to ‘therapeutic sessions, with, victims. of sexual. abuse,” and,
because she did “not treat or diagnose adult abusers of children”). Any opinion Rocchio might

offer about the:psychology: of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is

outside’ heriexpertise and therefore unreliable. United Siates v. Raniereé, No. 18-CR-2041-NGG-
VMS, 2019 WL 2212639, at *7(E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2019); see also Celebrity Cruises Inc. v.
Essef Corp.,434 F.Supp. 24,169, 192 (S.D.N:Y. 2006) (expert. not “permitted.to testify
regarding” subjects “outside'the expertise of the witness”).

2. ‘Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have. no valid basis.

Rocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all:the reasons given. above.
But there is another reason. this ‘Court should,cxelude her grooming opinions; under Rule 702: and.
Daibert: Nothing establishes the reliability of het: opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”

Recall that:Ms. Maxwell is not:accused of soliciting or ‘enticing sexualized massages for
herself. Instead, the government claims that. Ms..Maxwell, recruited minors to provide sexualized,
massages ‘for Mr. Epstcin. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved. grooming
behavior by Ms. Maxwell.

Theré is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to, support
Rocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application. of the
Daubert test, because the theory‘has not gained any acceptance (Ict;alone general, acecptance): in
the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has. not:and Cannot be 'testéd;.and there
is no: known or potential.rate of error. See. Daubert, 509'U:S, at.594. Rocchio’s opinions are

grooming-by-proxy are nothing but-préjudicial speculation. See Wehling v. Sandoz Pharms..
