LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA

States District Court for the Western District of Virginia ordered a semi-anonymous jury (jurors
were publicly referred to by number only) and released the names of all potential jurors to
counsel, plus all pro se defendants (including Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell), who
are allegedly prominent white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the leaders of hate groups that
planned, promoted, and executed the violent acts in Charlottesville. (See Exhibit A, annexed.)
The defendants in Sines included factions of the Ku Klux Klan. The concerns for juror privacy in
Sines dwarf any conceivable concerns in this case and Sines is also the subject of extensive
ongoing publicity. We submit that withholding the names of 600 jurors until the day of jury
selection will deprive Ms. Maxwell of her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury and is a
procedure that would violate due process in this particular case.!

“An impartial jury is one in which all of its members, not just most of them, are free of
interest and bias.” United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83, 111 (2d Cir. 2015). In Parse, a case
before Judge Pauley sub nom United States v. Daugerdas, a jury convicted defendant Parse and
three of his co-defendants of numerous financial fraud and tax evasion charges. 789 F.3d at 86.
After trial, all defendants moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a) for a new trial on the ground
that one of the jurors, Juror No. 1 (Catherine M. Conrad), “had lied and withheld material
information during voir dire and was biased against defendants. Judge Pauley appointed Bobbi
C. Sternheim, Esq. to represent the juror and conducted an evidentiary hearing in which the juror
was examined, and in a detailed thorough opinion (see United States v. Daugerdas, 867
F.Supp.2d 445 (S.D.N.Y.2012) found it “undisputed that Conrad lied extensively during voir dire
and concealed important information about her background” (id. at 451), her level of education,
place of residence, criminal history, and other matters. Parse, 789 F.33 at 87-90.

' We are unaware of any other recent high-profile case in which a written juror questionnaire was
used and the Court withheld the names of the jurors from counsel following the completion of
the questionnaires.
