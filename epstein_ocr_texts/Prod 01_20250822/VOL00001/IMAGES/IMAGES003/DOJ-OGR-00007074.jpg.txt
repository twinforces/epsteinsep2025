1 is the relevant basis for the jury's determination of guilt or
2 innocence. Why and when the government conducted the

3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the

4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting

5 Ms. Maxwell or somehow fabricating evidence or suborning

6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the
7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.

8 See, Regan, 103 F.3d 1082. Absent that, the law is clear that
9 for purposes of the jury, "the government is not on trial."

10 United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 51, (2d Cir. 2017).

11 Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly

12 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it

13 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be
14 applied in the case. Indeed, the defense's outlined evidence
15 of improper motives is strongly suggestive of jury

16 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political

17 prosecution which is rightly a matter reserved to the Court.

18 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's

19 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely
20 likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what
21 motivated a particular investigative step or charging decision
22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense
23 would have one story and the government another, neither of
24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt
25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's
