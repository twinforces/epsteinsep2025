Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 _ Filed 11/08/21 Page 22 o0f41

Prop.,2012 WL 526722, at,*2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts to actias ...... vehicles for factual
narrative”). This “opinion” should be:précluded.

4. Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault”

The defense’s offer of Dr. Dictz’s opinions ‘regarding the existence of false; allegations of
sexual. assault and the “multiple pathways to-thesc false allegations of'scxual assault” (Ex. A.at 7)
‘1s a-remarkable departure from ‘permissible practice ‘in a criminal trial, The very form. and ‘nature
of all of these opinions ‘is highly prejudicial and. secks to invade 'the province of the jury and,
displace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which. are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a.
‘single journal article (attached as. Exhibit C), is not the product: of:reliable methods applied. to the
case? the opinions are well. within the. ken of the jury; and there is no showing. whatsoever of any’
“fit” between these opinions:and the evidence to. be presented at trial.

The form. of Dr: Dictz’s opinions=listing a. number of disparate circumstances and.
personality traits, with:no showing:of any:conncetion to the evidence ofthis case, and. conjecturing
inversion of proper expert opinion. To, appreciate the audacity of the deferise approach, consider
if'the Government attempted to do something similar. If the defense put.on witnesses. at trial, and.
the Government then, called, in, rebuttal, an, expert ‘psychiatrist to offer opinions. on ‘Pathways. to
False Exculpatory’ Testimony” who..opined that a varicty of. citcumstances or mental conditions
could hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a. defendant, it is
safe'to assume that the defense would object. What:the defense offers here'is no.less Inappropriate’

Beyond the obvious problems with the form.ofthe opinions, the opinions themselves are
plainly not. admissible under Rule 702. Dr. Dictz’s opinion, that “[f]alse allegations of sexual

assault do occur” (Ex. A at.7), is not helpful'to the jury. There ‘will be ‘no dispute that allegations
