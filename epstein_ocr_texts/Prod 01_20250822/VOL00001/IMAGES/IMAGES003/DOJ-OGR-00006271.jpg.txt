Not all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there

has been little work on understanding the prevalence of false alle-

gations or pathways to these. This paper proposes 11 pathways to

false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent,

(c) false memories, (da) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality dis-

order, (P) borderline personality disorder, (g) bistrionic personality

disorder, (b) delirium, () psychotic disorders, () dissociation, and

(k) intellectual disability. These patbways originate in the psycho-

logical diatheses of the individual. Further research is needed into

the frequency of these pathways, ways to accurately detect these,

and whether otber pathways exist.

In many sexual assault cases, there is little, if any, unequivocal physical
evidence of a crime and no third-party eyewitnesses to bring decisive tes-
timony to the event in question (Binder & McNeil, 2007), complicating the
task of discerning the truth of a claim. Without clear physical evidence, the
decisions of the legal system are based merely on the relative credibility of
the narratives of the persons involved. In addition, physical evidence can be
ambiguous: Medical evidence may allow a determination of whether inter-
course occurred, and perhaps whether the intercourse was “rough,” but not
whether that sexual contact was consensual. Thus, in cases such as these
