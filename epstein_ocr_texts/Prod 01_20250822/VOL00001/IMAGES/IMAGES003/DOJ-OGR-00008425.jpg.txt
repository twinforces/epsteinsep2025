Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20. Cr. 330 (AIN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

I-write in-response to this Court’s order.

As to the first, question, federal, law is clear. “No longer, when a lawyer asks a witness
Whether he made a certain statement, written. or'not, is the lawyer required.(as he: was at common
law, see Note:of Advisory Committce:to Fed -R. Evid. 613(a)) to show the statement. or'disclose
its. contents to the witness, though. he must;upon. request show it to opposing counsel.” United
States ¥. Marks, 81.6 F.2d.1207, 1210 (7th Cir. 1986) (Posner, J.).

As to the second question, a statement:provable by extrinsic cvidenee even though the
‘witness affirms that the 3500 material contains, the inconsistent statement. and.also, expresses
disagreement with the substance. By disagrecing’with the substance, the witness has logically
and necessarily denied making the statement (or failed to remember‘making the statement).
Thus, under Rule 613, the statement is inconsistent because it has “uridér any rational theory it
might.lead to any relevant conclusion. different from.any otherrelevant conclusion. resulting from

anything the witness said.” United. States, v:, Barile, 286 F3d.749, 755 (4th. Cir. 2002)
