Cases hold the same. /:.g., Wnited. States v:, Medearis, 380. F.3d.1,049, 1057 (8th Cir.
2004) (Rule.:16(b)(1)(A) docs not.require, defense to. disclose evidence he, does. “not seck to use . .
in his case-in-chief”); United States v: Moore, 208 F 34.577, 579 (7th. Cir. 2000) (Rule
16(b)C1)(A) docs ‘not require defense to disclose evidence ‘used to, impeach “the testimony of a
witness forthe: prosecution,” because that is: not evidence introduced in a defendant’s “‘case-in-
chicf”).!

As Judge Easterbrook recognized, the government’s contrary argument in this case
“sorely misunderstands what it means to offer ‘evidence in chicf” (or evidence:in one’s ‘case:in
chief’). Moore, 208 F.3d at-579. In. fact, 'so obviously wrong is the government’s interpretation
of Rule 16 that, when. the government offered the same argument in United. Sratés ¥.. Moore,
Judge Easterbrook concluded that the district.court committed a‘plain, error in, excluding. a ctter
the defense offered into evidence. while cross-examining a ‘prosecution witness during the
government’s case-in-chief. Jd

The government,is also wrong to suggest that even if Ms. Maxwell did not have to
disclose statements used as impéachnient while cross-cxamining a:prosccution witness during
the government’s casein-chief, she: did have to disclose: other exhibits used.as impeachment,

suchas the photograph'she offered, into evidence while eross-examining Jane. Under:Rule 1.6(b)

| Nor does Rule HOCK) apply tomaterial a. defendant t uses to refresh, a. witness's.
Gray: - BUF PISS, 79) E. F.3d. 50, 57-58 . n. 2 (D. c Cir. 2015) (using documents to refresh.
recollection of government’s Witnesses not covered by Rule 16); United States“. King, 703 F.2d
119,126 n.6 (Sth.Cir. 1983) (noting that “even though the ‘documents were excluded. from
evidence” because of defendant’s failure to make a Rule: 16 disclosure, “[dJefense counsel was
allowed. to use the documents to refresh the recollection of witnesses”).
