dismiss the severed perjury counts at the time of sentencing, in light of the victims’ significant
interests in bringing closure to this matter and avoiding the trauma of testifying again.

If any of the defendant’s post-trial motions are granted, the Government proposes that the
parties be directed to promptly confer and propose a schedule for further proceedings. That
schedule may depend on the manner in which the Court resolves such motions.

Defense Position

The defense requests that the Court delay setting a schedule for sentencing because there
is a compelling basis for the Court to overturn Ms. Maxwell’s conviction and grant her a new trial
based on the disclosures of Juror #50 during deliberations. The parties are currently briefing that
issue. The defense therefore objects to setting a schedule for sentencing until this motion is
resolved. For the same reason, the defense intends to set forth in its moving papers the reasons
why Ms. Maxwell should not be forced to expend resources to brief other post-trial motions until
after the Court decides this motion.

Furthermore, requiring Ms. Maxwell to participate in the preparation of the Presentence
Investigation Report, while she is awaiting a decision on her motion for a new trial, will adversely
impact her Fifth Amendment rights. Ms. Maxwell will be forced into the position of not
cooperating with the Probation Department’s investigation because any statement she makes to
Probation, and any documents she provides, may be used against her at her retrial.
