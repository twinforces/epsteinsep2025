specifically is inadmissible as.a-vchicle for factual narrative based on only limited written
‘records. Jé. at.'17.

The Court first concludes that Dr. Dictz’s gencral opinion on the existence ofa
phenomenon called “the:halo effect” is admissible. ‘The testimony may be relevant;to the jury’s
determination, of Ms. Maxwell’s, knowledge because it could explain.how, for example, Ms.
Maxwell took actions that resulted in sexual abuse butwithout any intent or knowledge ‘of that
result. The risk of improper sympathy or the suggestion.of nullification can. be addressed with a
limiting instruction.

The Court will, however, without a further showing by the Defense, likely preclude Dr.
Dictz from applying the halo, cffect to Epstein. In the notice, Dr. Dietz diagnoses Epstein with
“antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic-personality disorders” that “allowed him.to use
his. brilliance to manipulate, people.” Notice at:6—7. Dr. Dictz never met or'cxamined Epstein,
but instcad bases this. opinion:on documents that he revicwed, including media interviews of.
Epstein, evidence from,the Florida investigation ‘of Epstein, and materials’ produced in this:
litigation. Jd. at-6; Def. Br., Ex. 1 at: 166=68. But-neither Dr. Dictz nor the Defense has offered
support for the-claim that this is:a.rcliable means by which an.expert in Dr. Dictz’s ficld-would
diagnose an:individual., Typically, federal courts admit ‘an expert, diagnosis of a personality
disorder only if the expert:personally interviewed the diagnosed:individual. /.g:, 7éhatat. City
