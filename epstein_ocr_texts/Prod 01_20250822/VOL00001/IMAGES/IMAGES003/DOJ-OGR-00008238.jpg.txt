that a lawyer's assistance, can only be safely and readily availed of when, free, from the
‘consequences or the apprehension of disclosure” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The
privilege “protects communications (L) between a clicnt and his or her attorney (2) that are
intended to be, and in. fact were, kept confidential (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing:
legal, advice.” United. States v» Krug, 868 F.3d.82, 86 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks

The attorney-client privilege “belongs solely to the client-and may only be:waived by [her].
An, attorney may not waive the privilege without [her] clicnt’s consent.” Ji re'von Bulow, 828
F.2d 94, 100 (2d Cir. 1987); seé Chiraé ¥. Reinicker, 24 U.S.280, 294 (1826) (“The privilege,
indeed, is not’that of the attorney, but of the: client ....”). Absent such a.waiver, however, “the
publication of confidential, communications by. an. attorney docs not constitute.a relinquishment of
the privilege by the client.” Jn. re-von. Bulow, 828 F.2d at 100; see Hanson y. U.S. Agency for Intl
Dev., 372 F.3d 286, 294 (4th Cir. 2004) (“Roy as an attorney could not waive USAID's right.
without USAID’s consent.”).'' Courts have found that.clicnts have implicdly waived -the privilege:
“when_a. client: testifies concerning, portions of the attorney-client communication, when. a. client
places the attorney-client: relationship directly at issue, and when. a, client, asserts reliance on, an,
attorncy’s. advice as an, clement of a claim or defense.” Jn Fe Count} of Erie, 546 F.3d. 222, 228
(2d Cir. 2008) (alterations and. internal ‘quotation.marks omitted). The “quintessential example of’
‘an. implied waiver of the:privilege” occurs when a client: asserts an advicc-of-counsel defense. Jd:

(internal quotation marks omitted).

 In.“appropriate circumstances,” an. attorney “may: . . . possess an implicd. authority: to waive the
privilege on. behalf of: his client.” Jn re-von Bulow, 828 F.2d. at 101 (internal quotation marks
