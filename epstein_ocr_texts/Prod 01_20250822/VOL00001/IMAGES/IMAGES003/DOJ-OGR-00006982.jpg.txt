6 questions about what I've described so far.

7 Ms. Pomerantz.

8 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.

9 The government, I'm happy to raise certain questions
10 we have regarding the names and locations to be supplied in the
11 oral voir dire, as the government has certain proposals that it
12 would like to set forth for the Court. I'm happy to do that
13 now or at another point if the Court would like.

14 THE COURT: Do these proposals relate to the
15 government's motion that was just filed but not fully briefed,
16 or are those separate concerns?
17 MS. POMERANTZ: It relates to the government's motion
18 regarding privacy and dignity of certain minor victims in this
19 case, specifically relating to the request that victims and
20 witnesses, certain victims and witnesses testify under
al pseudonyms or their first names only.
22 THE COURT: Right. I think I have to get briefing on
23 that motion. Needless to say I'm not prepared to rule on that
24 yet, so to the extent that the proposals you want to suggest
25 had a resolution of that motion, I think we need to wait. But
