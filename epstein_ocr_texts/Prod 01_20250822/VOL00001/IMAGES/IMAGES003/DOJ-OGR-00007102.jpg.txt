1 co-conspirator statements that it intends to introduce at trial
2 pursuant to 801(d) (2) (E) and specifically representative

13 obviously fall into the law regarding conditional admission,

14 the government shall file a letter, by November 10, justifying
15 admission of exemplars and statements over which the parties

16 disagree. So that's the 10th, and then the defense could put

20 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

22 THE COURT: I think it is probably worth maybe just a
23 moment, because it impacts this issue and some other ones, to
24 just discuss one category of potential statements that's been
25 flagged and that's alleged co-conspirator statements that date
