positive: for COVID. We now have documentation of, his test results. As a result, he-cannot travel.
or attend. the trial. in person. In, licu. of responding’to, our request:to work out a stipulation based
on Mr. Hamilton’s deposition, the government has moved for preclusion of his testimony in.
toto. We are requesting permission to have Mr. Hamilton testify from his'home via ‘a WebEx link
to'the Courtroom. In United. States v.,. Khaled. Al Fawwaz, 98 Cr. 1023 (LAK); Judge Kaplan
ordered. live CGLV testimony ‘of a government witness who was:unable to travel from. London. to
SDNY due to a medical condition: Counsel for both. parties (then-AUSA.Nicholas Lewin, and,
defense counsel Bobbi C. Sternhcim, Esq.) traveled to London to conduct the examination. which
was transmitted yia CCTV to Judge Kaplan’s courtroom for real-time viewing’bythe jury. Mr,
Hamilton ‘is quarantined and highly. contagious. He should be permitted to testify. remotely.

KK:

Ms. Maxwell has a‘constitutional right confront her accusers, and:to present.a defense.
U:S. Const. amends. V, VI. Precluding Mr. Hamilton. from testifying, when his proposed,
testimony ‘is proper. under the Rules of-Evidence, would violate:these constitutional. guarantees.
This, Court should reject the government’s attempt to preclude Ms. Maxwell from exposing
Kate’s motive aid, bias tothe. jury.

This Court.should deny the.government’s motion.
