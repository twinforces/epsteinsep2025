the defendant knew that, when she arranged for a young girl—such as Minor Victim-1 or Minor
Victim-4— to give Epstein a massage, that massage involved sexual contact.

Second, the evidence is relevant to the defendant’s motive. The Government expects the
defense to argue that the defendant had no reason to assist Epstein in obtaining sexualized
massages, especially from young girls. Minor Victim-3 will testify that

Third, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is probative of her intent. “‘Where intent to
commit the crime charged is clearly at issue’—1.e., where it is an element of the crime—‘evidence
of prior similar acts may be introduced to prove that intent.’” United States v. Graham, No. 14 Cr.
500 (NSR), 2015 WL 6161292, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2015) (quoting United States v. Caputo,
808 F.2d 963, 968 (2d Cir. 1987)). The defendant is likely to argue that any steps taken to arrange
massages were purely innocent conduct. See id. (“Prior act evidence is admissible to demonstrate
intent ‘where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation.’” (quoting Zackson,
12 F.3d at 1182 (alterations omitted))). Evidence of the defendant’s knowledge that massages
were sexualized and the defendant’s motives described above is probative of her intent to entice
and transport minors for the purpose of sexual contact. Minor Victim-3’s sexualized massages
began around the time the conspiracy started, yet the massages continued—with the defendant’s
active involvement, as to Minor Victim-3 and other Minor Victims—for years. That is highly
probative evidence of her intent as to each of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. And
Minor Victim-3’s testimony contains additional evidence of the defendant’s intent. For instance,
