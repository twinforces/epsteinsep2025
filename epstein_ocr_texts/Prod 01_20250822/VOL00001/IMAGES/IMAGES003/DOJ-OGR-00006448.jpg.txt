I. SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-
ESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW

At this point, everyone associated withthis litigation.knows the: definition-of a “judicial.
document.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption, in favor of public inspection and, copying of
any item.cntered into evidence at.a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,
Inc., 635 F.2d.945, 952 (2d Cir. 1980). Morcover, after “the:evidence has become known. to the
members of the'public, including:representatives of the:press, through, their attendance at a public
Session of court, it*would take, the most’ extraordinary circumstances. to justify: restrictions on the
when it ‘is in.a form. that-rcadily permits sight.and sound:reproduction.” Jd. Where the requested
documents were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public:right of access to
judicial, documents was largely derived. from the role those documents playcd.in determining
litigants’ substantive rights -- conduct: at*the heart of Article III -- and. from the need for public:
monitoring of that conduct. United States 'v.. Graham, 257 F.3d.143, 151. (2d Cir. 2001).

Suppression of any exhibit that contains.an accuser’s name in, this case is doubly
problematic: -- many’ of the. anticipated cxhibits aré “judicial documents” from. other procecdings,
that have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There jis
nothing confidential about: the cxhibits:and. neither the exhibits ‘nor the names of the: witnesses
should. be redacted or-suppressed.

INAPPROPRIATE

The government sccks:a pre-trial. ruling that certain unspecified “prior:consistent
statements" of the accusers will’be admissible at trial if the defense "challenges the credibility of

the testimony” of the accusers iti some unspecified way. Mot. at 17. Under'the government's

apparent view, ay: credibility:challenge will permit amy prioristatement of the government's:
