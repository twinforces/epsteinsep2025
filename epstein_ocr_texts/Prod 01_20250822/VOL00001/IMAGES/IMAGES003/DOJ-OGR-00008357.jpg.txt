Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter seeking an order directing the defense to
provide the Government with the witnesses it anticipates calling next week by 10:00 a.m.
tomorrow, December 13, 2021.!

The Government previewed for several days prior to the close of the Government’s case
that it would rest sometime last week. Following the close of the Government’s case, the
Government requested that the defense provide the Government with Rule 26.2 material, along
with “a list of witnesses, and an order of the first witnesses.” Tr. 2276. The Court ordered the
defense to do so, stating, “Yes. You’ll do that.” Jd.

' The defense also made an untimely production of Rule 16 materials on Friday evening, following
the close of the Government’s case. The Government will file a motion to preclude later this
evening.
