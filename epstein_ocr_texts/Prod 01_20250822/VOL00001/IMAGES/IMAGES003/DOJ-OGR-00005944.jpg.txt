pressure for young people by providing opportunities to tell may be needed to
help young people tell more promptly. However, the lack of control that young
people experience following disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2009b;
Quayle et al., 2012). This highlights the need for dissemination of information
directly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of
disclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young
people and their families interface with the legal system.

of such an approach. Ungar et al. (2009a) describe the optimal conditions for

nature of disclosure, and the important role that trusted adults and peers play
in the disclosure process through noticing signs of psychological distress and
asking young people about their psychological wellbeing (Collings ef al.,

2005; Jensen ef al., 2005; McElvaney et al., 2012). More emphasis is therefore
needed on providing opportunities for children and young people to disclose.
The challenge for professionals and those who care for children is how to do
this in a way that protects children and promotes their wellbeing.
