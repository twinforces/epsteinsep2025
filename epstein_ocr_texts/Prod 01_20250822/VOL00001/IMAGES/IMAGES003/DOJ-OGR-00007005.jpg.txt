1 for or against any laws or regulations relating to sex

2 trafficking, sex crimes against minors, sex abuse, or sexual

3 harassment generally, or supported organizations that seek to
4 address sex abuse or sexual harassment generally?"

5 THE COURT: So you've changed the question beyond

6 inserting "protested."

7 MS. STERNHEIM: That's correct.

8 THE COURT: Let me ask you to give that to me again.
9 MS. STERNHEIM: Of course.
10 "Have you or any family member ever lobbied,
11 petitioned, protested, or worked in any other manner for or
12 against any laws or regulations relating to sex trafficking,
13 sex crimes against minors, sex abuse, or sexual harassment
14 generally, or supported organizations that seek to address sex
15 abuse or sexual harassment generally?"
16 THE COURT: Just a moment.
17 Ms. Pomerantz.
18 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.
19 The government doesn't have an issue with adding the
20 word "protested," but I would submit that the additional
al language proposed by the defense makes the question a bit
22 vague, and I think the Court's question, as framed, captures
23 sufficient information and should get, I think, several
24 responses from prospective jurors.
25 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, I will accept "protested";
