D. Bennett Gershman

Professor Gershman is a Distinguished Professor of Law at the Elisabeth Haub School of
Law of Pace University since its founding as the Pace Law School in 1976. He has also taught as
a visiting professor at Cornell Law School and Syracuse Law School. Prior to coming to Pace, he
was a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and the New York State Anti-
Corruption Office. Professor Gershman’s extensive scholarship has had an essential role in
establishing the study of prosecutorial misconduct, a subject at the intersection of criminal
procedure and professional ethics. He is a leading authority on prosecutorial misconduct and the
author of the treatise, Prosecutorial Misconduct, a preeminent resource for scholars and
practitioners.

We expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best practices to ensure the
integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,
neutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their
counsel, and case-related civil litigation. His extensive experience and credentials are recited in
his curriculum vitae, annexed as Exhibit G.
