1 is bought that day, it's direct evidence, if it's bought three
2 years earlier or three years later, at best it's 404(b)

3 evidence, not direct evidence.

4 MS. MOE: Well, here the pattern would be much

5 stronger, that the defendant participated -- again, to play out
6 the analogy -- in a robbery in 1994 involving ski masks, and

7 another robbery in 1995 involving ski masks, and again another
8 robbery in which the defendant bought ski masks, and then a

9 robbery years later in which the perpetrator was wearing a very
10 similar ski mask. That's the pattern here and why this is

11 direct evidence of the defendant's methods and her knowledge

12 and intent.

13 THE COURT: That's 404(b), evidence of methods, of MO.
14 MS. MOE: Here, your Honor, the government certainly
15 submits that this would otherwise be admissible under Rule

16 404(b), but here where the conduct is intertwined with the

17 conduct on trial, that it speaks to her knowledge about

18 preferences and the role that she played and the similarity,

19 and the fact this happened during the course of the charged
20 conspiracy the same time the defendant was involved in this
21 conduct with respect to other --
22 THE COURT: During the time of the Mann Act charged
23 conspiracy.
24 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Not the trafficking charged conspiracy.
