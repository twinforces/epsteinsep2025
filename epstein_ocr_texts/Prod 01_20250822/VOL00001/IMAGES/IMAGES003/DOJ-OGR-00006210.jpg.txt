compromised. (See, e.g., Dkt. 282 at 2 (finding “nothing in the record plausibly establishes that
current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with
her lawyers”)).

Finally, in a single paragraph, the defendant argues that the Jencks Act and Giglio material
she has received “contradict the purported ‘strength’ of the government’s case.” (Def. Mot. 6). But
that claim is supported by only the most conclusory of assertions that “there is no independent
corroboration” for the victims’ statements and that they “demonstrate contamination and collusion
from various sources.” (/d.). The defendant has made such arguments about the strength of the
Government’s case before (see, e.g., Dkt. 18 at 19; Dkt. 97 at 30-33; Dkt. 171 at 7-8), and each
time the Court has rejected the defendant’s bail application. (See, e.g., Second Order at 9-10
(rejecting the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of its case at the bail
hearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony”)). Moreover, since
the Court’s third detention order, the Court has also rejected the defendant’s pretrial motions to
dismiss the charges (Dkt. 207, 317), the pendency of which the defendant had also claimed
undermined the strength of the case (see, e.g., Dkt. 171 at 7-8), and a grand jury returned a
superseding indictment charging additional counts based on an additional victim, and the
Government intends to prove the existence of two additional victims at trial. Thus, the defendant’s
latest ipse dixit about the victims does not in fact “undermine the strength of the government’s
case.” (Def. Mot. 6). Quite the contrary, that the defendant is this close to trial and still cannot
make a more compelling argument about the strength of the case underscores what has been
apparent from the Government’s first proffer: the case is strong.

The defendant’s motion for reconsideration should be denied.
