Re: United States-v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this lctter:in reply to the defendant’s. motion to
exclude Government Exhibit 52. (See \Dkt. "No. 476). The ‘Court ordered the Government to
respond, in, particular to the defendant’s argument that “Employec-l cannot authenticate
Government Exhibit 52 because Mr. Rodriguez, a former employce, purportedly removed the
document.from the property before Employce-! began working for:Mr. Epstein.” «(7d:)

The Second Circuit.has “often:commented that the bar for-authentication.of evidence:is not.
particularly high.” United States v. Al-Moyad, 545 F.3d. 139, 172. (2d Cir. 2008) (alteration, and.
internal. quotation marks omitted). The “proponent of the evidence is ‘ot required. to rule out all
possibilitics.inconsistent- with authenticity, or to prove beyond a reasonable doubt:that the evidence

Is what it purports'to be.” United States 'vi Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658 (2d Cir..2001). All that is
