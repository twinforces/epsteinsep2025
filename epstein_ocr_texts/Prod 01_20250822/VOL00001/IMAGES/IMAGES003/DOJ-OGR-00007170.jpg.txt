1 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. We have not been asking to
2 do that mindful of their obligations towards all of the other

3 inmates at the facility but we appreciate the steps they have

4 taken to be responsive to our alerts and about the defense's

5 requests. For example, in some instances I think the defense

6 has been e-mailing legal counsel noting certain tracking

7 numbers and asking them to check at the particular warehouse.

8 So that process seems to be working. I don't think we can

9 create a system where the defendant is receiving, in jail, ona
10 24-hour basis, all disclosures. I don't think that is

11 practical but I think especially because, in some instances, we
12 may be uploading to the defense through a file sharing program
13 certain disclosures on one day and they may be meeting with the
14 defendant in person the very next day, they certainly have the
15 ability to talk about those materials with the defendant, to

16 provide her with paper copies if they wish, and I think that is
17 more than sufficient.

18 THE COURT: Well, you are not suggesting that instead
19 of government sending the materials to the facility and working
20 with the facility to facilitate timely movement of the
21 materials to Ms. Maxwell, are you?
22 MS. MOE: Of course, your Honor.
23 Our view is in combination of the fact that, in the
24 short-term, the defense has the opportunity to talk to the
25 defendant immediately about it if they wish to, and in longer
