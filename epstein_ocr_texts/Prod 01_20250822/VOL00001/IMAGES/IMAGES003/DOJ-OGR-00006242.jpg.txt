(affirming district court’s exclusion of expert testimony on memory and perception, including the
impact of stress on memory, in context of eyewitness reliability because proposed testimony would
not assist the jury); United States v. Labansat, 94 F.3d 527, 530 (9th Cir. 1996) (“It is common
knowledge that memory fades with time.”); United States v. Curry, 977 F.2d 1042, 1050-53 (7th
Cir. 1992) (“[S]uch testimony may be properly excluded where the testimony addresses an issue
of which the jury is generally aware.”); United States v. Shiraishi, No. 17 Cr. 582 (JMS) (RLP),
2019 WL 1386365, at *5 n.7 (D. Haw. Mar. 27, 2019) (where testimony “falls within the common

(excluding memory expert under Rules 702 and 403, and noting that “[w]hile in unique
circumstances expert testimony regarding memory and perception may be warranted, this is not
one of those cases”); United States v. Libby, 461 F. Supp. 2d 3, 12 (D.D.C. 2006) (‘“[JJurors
inevitably encounter the frailties of memory as a commonplace matter of course.”).

Federal courts—typically in the context of proposed expert testimony regarding witness
identifications—have historically evinced skepticism of so-called memory expert testimony and
