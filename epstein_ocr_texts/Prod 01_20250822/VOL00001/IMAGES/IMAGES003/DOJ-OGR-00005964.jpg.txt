Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 398 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page9of52

In United States v. Velez, No. 3:10CR147 JBA, 2010 WL 4929266, at *7 (D. Conn. Nov.
30, 2010), the defendant moved for disclosure of any co-conspirator statements in advance of
trial. In response, the government agreed to disclose “well in advance of trial, exactly which of
the intercepted telephone calls will be offered as full exhibits at trial and transcripts of those calls
will be provided in advance of trial.” Based on that representation the court denied the motion to
produce as moot, “without prejudice to renew if the Government fails to comply with its ongoing
disclosure obligations.” /d.

In United States v. Smalls, No. CR 06-2403 RB, 2008 WL 11361098, at *8—9 (D.N.M.
