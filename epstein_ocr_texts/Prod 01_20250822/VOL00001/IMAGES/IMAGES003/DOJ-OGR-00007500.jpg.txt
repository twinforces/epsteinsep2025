halo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental
disorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and
vice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2017).

Halo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a
state in which attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive
consistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2012), cognitive
consistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allow for
the predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted
psychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive
consistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2012, p. 652). But because the world is
often not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to
impose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follow
from evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift toward coherence with the emerging
decision” (Simon, Snow, & Read, 2004, p. 814; Greenspan & Scurich, 2016). As a result,
perceptions and decisions become highly skewed toward one interpretation while alternatives are
neglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs
unconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.

Halo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham

(2016):

Once unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can

easily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for how a target is

treated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may

selectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information

available (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn

lead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:

interpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even

for decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)
Like many people who achieve great power and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect
to surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his
wealth attracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated
level, others with halos of their own—through any combination of power, influence, fame,
brilliance, attractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein
for reasons of their own, and being seen in their company empowered him and made him look
above suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between
different kinds of power—such as Bill Clinton’s political power, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’
physical power, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual power—and acknowledged that he gravitated
to people of power. [CONFIDENTIAL] SDNY _GM_ SUPP _00219000.mov.

The materials reviewed reflect that Jeffrey Epstein was a brilliant man who was flawed
by enduring personality traits familiar to psychiatrists as “Cluster B personality traits,” found
among those with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders.
