Table 2. Factors Influencing Child, Sexual Abuse Disclosures.,

‘Barriers

Facilitators

Age: The'younger the.child victim, the less likely. they will purposefully
disclose.

Gender: Males may: be:less,likely to.disclose.in childhood/adolescence;
fear’of being seén.as: homosexiial and as a‘victim, femalés experiénce
more self blame and anticipation of being blamed and/or: not:

Relationship:to;perpetrator: If the perpetrator is.a family member‘or in
a family‘ like. role, disclosure is less’ likely'to happen

Internal: Shame; self blame, and fear are: psychological barriers: In
addition, ‘fear ‘of negative consequences on the family, and for self.
safety inhibits disclosure:

Family relations: Families’with a patriarchal structure; rigidly: fixed
géndet ‘réles, dysfuhctional communication, other forms of abuse
(ie; domestic violence); and isolation inhibit disclosure

‘Environmental and .cultural:context: Lack of. discussion-about sexuality;
passive:acceptance: that unwanted sexual experiences are inevitable;
not wanting‘to bring shame to ‘the’family by:admitting sexual abuse;
lack:of involvement from neighbors; school personnel; and stigma
perpetuated by ‘societal perceptions -

‘Age: Disclosures: increase*with age, especially, in adulthood.

‘Gender: Slight trend’toward:females who are older (adolescent) to,

disclose before adulthood

Relationship to perpetrator: If the: perpetrator jis: not:living with the
victim, disclosure rates increase

Dialogical context: Opportunities to disclose through discussion,
therapeutic relationship, information sessions on sexuality, and
sexual abuse prevention programs

Family: relations: Supportive: parent-child relationship.

Involvefment of others? Eyewitnesses coming forward and reporting,
detection through ‘community members; professionals

Environmental and cultural context: Promoticn: of open: discussion of:
sexuality; community’member involvement

‘as ‘children ‘gain more developmental. capacity, ‘understanding:
as: ‘victimization, and inereased independence.

SS likely to disclose, iit this’ 1s Often in
interaction “with other factors. in the environment such as soci-
‘etal ‘attitudes:that. promote hypermasculinity as desirable, atti-
tudes*that perpetuate negative views of. boys and men who. are
victims, and homophobic attitudes (Alaggia. 20.1.0: aston,
etals,2014; Gagnier & Collin: Vézina, 2016).

‘Victims of intrafamilial abuse-when the offender:is a ‘parent,
‘caregiver, ‘significant family member, orsomcone ‘in a. family-
like: rolé.are less likely to disclose mmediately’ or at all in,
childhood/adolescenee because of obvious power differentials
and dependency :needs (Collings ctal., 2005; Dumont ct al.,
20.1.4; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Kogan, 2004; Eeclere-& Wort-
ley, 20:15;, Paine & Hansen, 2002; Schacffer ct ‘al. 20.17)

Further, the pe petrator 1 résidiig with, ‘their victiin(s)
increases’ the likelihood of no, disclosure (Leclere: & Wortley,
2015).

Internalized victim-blaming.:mechanisms'to protect oneself
‘tal immaturity: atthe onset of abuse constituted internal ‘bar-
riers. Further, shame, self-blame,.and:fearhave been identified
as Significant factors-deterring disclosure (Collin-Vézina.et al.,
20.15; Grisma et al., 2004; Gioodman- Brown etal. 2003; Hiun-
ter, 20112: ) é rulhane, 201 a
vancy ct al... 2014). However, aspects of shame. seif:blame: and,
fear, and have not been fully explored in research. Since these
‘are ‘strong’ predictors ‘of disclosure ‘suppression, they’bear fur-
ther examination ih, futin carch té understand nor “fully
how: they: operate in: disclosure ‘processes.

‘In terms of interpersonal. and environmental ‘factors, ‘family:
dynamics:can playa‘part in:deterring:disclosure. As previously
mentioned, familics characterized. by ‘rigidly définied gender

(Collin Vezina et al.. 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010).
