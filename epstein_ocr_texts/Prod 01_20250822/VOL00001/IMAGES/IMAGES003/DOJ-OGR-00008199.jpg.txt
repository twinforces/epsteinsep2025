disclose his intended exhibits, “at,a minimum, potentially infringed on [his] right to duc ‘process
because: his compliance with the disclosure order ‘may help, the prosecution meéct:its burden of.
proof”). And it would compromise: her constitutional. right to confront the witnesses against her,
aright she is free to exercise without previewing her defense forthe government. U.S.'Const:
