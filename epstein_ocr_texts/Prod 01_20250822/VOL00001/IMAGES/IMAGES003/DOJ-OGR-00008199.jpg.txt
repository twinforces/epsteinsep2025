Here, there is no prejudice, and the government did not attempt to identify any.
Moreover, any conceivable prejudice can be remedied by giving the government additional time
to review the photograph before Ms. Maxwell again offers it into evidence. See, e.g., United
States v. Kessler, 926 F.3d 490, 491 (8th Cir. 2019) (concluding that court was correct not to
exclude government’s evidence of “the dollar value of the methamphetamine,” despite Rule 16
violation, because the court “provided a one-hour recess that allowed defense counsel to prepare
a response”).>

The government’s interpretation of Rule 16, if accepted, would violate Ms. Maxwell’s
constitutional rights to due process and the confrontation. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI.
Compelling Ms. Maxwell to disclose to the prosecution, in advance, evidence she intends to use
to impeach government witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief would
unconstitutionally force her to aid the government in meeting its burden of proof. U.S. Const.
amend. V. See People v. Kilgore, 455 P.3d 746, 751 (Colo. 2020) (compelling the defendant to
disclose his intended exhibits, “at a minimum, potentially infringed on [his] right to due process
because his compliance with the disclosure order may help the prosecution meet its burden of
proof’). And it would compromise her constitutional right to confront the witnesses against her,
a right she is free to exercise without previewing her defense for the government. U.S. Const.
amend. VI.

> Of course, come tomorrow, the government will have had more than twelve hours to
review the photograph.
