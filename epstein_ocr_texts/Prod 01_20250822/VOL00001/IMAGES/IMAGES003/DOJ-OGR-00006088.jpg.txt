Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — Third Element
The third element of Count Two which the government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt is that +he-defendentMs. Maxwell acted with the intent that heindiidual [Jane Doe-1_
pseudonym] would engage in sexual activity with Jeffrey Epstein for which any person can be
charged with a criminal offense under New York law.
“Intentionally” Defined
A person acts intentionally when the act is the product of her conscious objective, that is,
when she acts deliberately and purposefully and not because of a mistake or accident. Direct
proof of a person’s intent is almost never available. It would be a rare case where it could be
shown that a person wrote or stated that, as of a given time, she committed an act with a
particular intent. Such direct proof is not required. The ultimate fact of intent, though subjective,
may be established by circumstantial evidence, based upon the defendant’s outward
manifestations, her words, her conduct, her acts and all the surrounding circumstances disclosed
by the evidence and the rational or logical inferences that may be drawn from them.
