Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On November 1, 2021, the Defense noticed eight expert witnesses. Dkt. No. 418-1. On
November 15, 2021, the Government filed a motion to preclude the testimony of six of the
experts. See id. The Defense filed a response on November 19, 2021, and the Government filed
a motion for leave to file a reply on November 22, 2021.! The moving papers have been filed
temporarily under seal to permit the parties the opportunity to propose sealing or limited
redactions in accordance with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006).

In two Memorandum Opinions and Orders temporarily filed under seal, the Court
GRANTS the Government’s motion to preclude as to Dr. Ryan Hall’s testimony and GRANTS
the Government’s motion to preclude as to Bennett Gershman’s testimony.

The Court will send the temporarily sealed Memorandum Opinions and Orders to the
parties. By November 24, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to inform the Court whether either
seeks sealing or limited redactions of the Memorandum Opinions and Orders, justifying any such
request by reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

! The Court denies the Government’s request to file a reply because the Government’s motion to preclude
and the Defendant’s response are sufficient for this Court to rule on the motion.
