1 Section 3771(a) (8).

2 It is quite common for alleged victims, both in cases
3 that have garnered media attention and those involving

4 allegations of sex abuse, to testify or be referred to by

5 pseudonyms or first names. Courts have allowed this whether or
6 not the alleged victims are minors or adults or adults

7 testifying about abuse that allegedly occurred when they were

8 minors.

14 involving at least one adult testifying about sex abuse as
15 minor; United States v. Dupigny, No. 18 CR 528, involving sex
16 trafficking, United States v. Kelly, No. 7 CR 374, and that
17 could be found at 2008 WL 5068820, which is an Eastern District
18 case involving an adult testifying about sex abuse as a minor;
19 United States v. Graham, No. 14 CR 500, found at 2015 WL
20 6161292 (S.D.N.Y., October 2015), that involved adults
21 testifying about sex trafficking as minors; United States v.
22 Gardner, No. 16 CR 20135, found at 2016 WL 5404207, an Eastern
23 District case from 2016 involving adults and adults testifying
24 about sex abuse aS a minor, and collecting similar cases.
