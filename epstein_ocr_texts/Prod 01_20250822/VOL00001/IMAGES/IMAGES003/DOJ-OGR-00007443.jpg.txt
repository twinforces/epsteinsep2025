While some may find this morally reprehensible, or even repugnant, it is perfectly legal and does
not in any way establish a “sexual preference” for underage girls. Moreover, to the extent the
government is seeking to introduce Accuser-3’s evidence to show Epstein’s sexual preference for
“young girls”—which would include women who are young, but still above the age of consent like
Accuser-3—that would mislead the jury and invite them to convict Ms. Maxwell based on a moral
judgment of sexual activity which, in the case of Accuser-3, was entirely legal.

Second, Epstein’s “sexual preference” is impermissible propensity evidence that is
inadmissible under Rule 404(b). Epstein’s alleged “sexual preference” is evidence of his
character. By its own admission, the government wants to use Accuser-3’s testimony to prove this
aspect of Epstein’s character and argue that he acted in accordance with this character with the
other Accusers. That is classic propensity evidence that cannot be admitted under Rule 404(b).
See United States v. Buczkowski, No. 5:08-CR-159-F, 2009 WL 10681888, at *1 (E.D.N.C. Jan.
26, 2009) (testimony that the victim began having sex with the defendant as an adult at age 16 “is
relevant only to prove propensity of the Defendant’s sexual preference for young females” and is
inadmissible under Rule 404(b)).

The government’s proposed bases for admitting Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 404(b)
are also unavailing. As previously argued, Accuser-3’s evidence does not show that Ms. Maxwell
knew Epstein engaged in sexualized massages with underaged girls. See November 5 Ltr. at 7-8.
At most, it establishes that she allegedly knew that he engaged in sexualized massages with adult
women. Similarly, her evidence does not show that Ms. Maxwell had a motive to obtain
underaged girls to satisfy Epstein’s sexual desires. See id. at 8. At most, it shows that she
