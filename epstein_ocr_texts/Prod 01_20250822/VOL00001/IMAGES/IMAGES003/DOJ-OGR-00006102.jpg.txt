doubt is that the-defendantMs. Maxwell knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported,
provided, or obtained [Jane Doe-4 pseudonym|a-person. The terms “recruited,” “enticed,”
“harbored,” “transported,” “provided,” and “obtained” have their ordinary, everyday meanings.
Adapted from the charge given by the Hon. Kimba M. Wood in United
States v. Almonte, 16 Cr. 670 (KMW)); United States v. Wedd, 993 F.3d
104, 122 (2d Cir. 2021) (“In interpreting a statute, this Court gives the
statutory terms their ordinary or natural meaning.” (internal quotation
marks omitted)). See, e.g., Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F. Supp. 3d 504, 517
(S.D.N.Y. 2018) (explaining that, because the verb “entices” is “not
defined by Congress,” it bears its ordinary meaning).
