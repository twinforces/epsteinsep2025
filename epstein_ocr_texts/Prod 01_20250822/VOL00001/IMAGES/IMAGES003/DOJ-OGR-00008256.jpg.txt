1 that in advance of trial if I can't get to it by then.

2 From your perspective, other outstanding issues that
3 the Court hasn't addressed yet?

4 MS. COMEY: Nothing outstanding, your Honor. The

5) government did have a few small issues to alert your Honor to.
6 But I'll defer to the defense on these issues you already

7 raised.

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Late breaking, we requested subpoena

9 issue last evening.

10 THE COURT: Yes.

11 MR. PAGLIUCA: IT understand that's very new, but I'm
12 just flagging that as an outstanding issue.

13 THE COURT: Yes. And let me ask, has notice been

14 provided to the victim witnesses?

15 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor. We received it late last
16 night and had not had the opportunity to provide that notice,
17 but we will do that today.

18 THE COURT: So the government will provide notice?

19 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: So, I don't know that it matters. I can
21 issue the subpoena, if there is a motion to quash, we can deal
22 with it, or we can brief it in advance.
23 I think we need to move as expeditiously as possible,
24 so my inclination would be to issue the subpoena, and if there
25 is a basis to quash, the government can be heard.
