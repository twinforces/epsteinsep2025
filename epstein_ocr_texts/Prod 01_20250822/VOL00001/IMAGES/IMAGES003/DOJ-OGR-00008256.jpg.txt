From your perspective, other outstanding issues that
the Court hasn't? addressed yet?

MS, COMEY: Nothing outstanding, your Honor, The
government, did have a few small issues to alert your Honor to.
But I'll defer to the defense on these issues you already
raised.

MR, PAGLIUCA: Late breaking, we requested subpoena
issue last, evening.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand that.'s very new, but I'm
just flagging that as an outstanding issue.

THE COURT: Yess And let tie ask, has hotitce been
provided to the victim witnesses?

MS. GOMEY: “No; your Honér. We received it late last
night. and had not. had ‘the opportunity ‘to provide that. notace,
but we will dé that tdéday.

THE COURT: So the government will provide notice?

MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: So, I don't know that it matters. I can.
issue the subpoena, if there is a motion to quash, wé can déedl
wath 2t, em we can, brief it in, advance.

I think we need to mévé as expeditiously as possiblé,
so my inclination would be to issue the subpoena, and if, there
1s a basis to quash, the government can be heard.
