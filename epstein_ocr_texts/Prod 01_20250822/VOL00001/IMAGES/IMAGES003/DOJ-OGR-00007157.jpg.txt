1 hearsay grounds that I have already indicated I'm going to have
2 the parties address further, correct?

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: All right.

a Any questions about any of those rulings?

6 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank
7 you.

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor. Thank you.

9 THE COURT: And about the time frames I have set on

10 the different pieces that I require briefing on after everybody
11 has. And, you will get the transcript.

12 MS. MOE: Understood, your Honor. Thank you.

13 THE COURT: All right.

14 With that, I think we can pick up some outstanding

15 logistics issues and I will hear from counsel as to any issues
16 they want to raise.

17 So, we begin our questionnaire process on Thursday.

18 The government -- my chambers will produce the copies as an

19 original matter. The government will take the completed copies
20 from the jury department -- the completed questionnaires with
2l no identifying information and make copies for the defense and
22 for the Court. My request is to give both a paper copy and an
23 electronic copy. I think that will aid everybody's use of the
24 document since we have got multiple people looking at them, and
25 then of course return the originals to the Court.
