MS. MOE: Understood, youn Honer. Thank ‘you.

THE GOURT: All right.

With ‘that, I, think we can, pick up some outstanding
16gistits issues and I will hear from counsel as to any issués
they want to raise.

So, we begin our questionnaire protéss on Thursday.

The government. my chambers will produce the copies as an
original mattér. The government will take the completed copies
from the jury department -- the completed questionnaires with
no idéntifying information and make copies for the défense and
fon the Court. My request jis to give both a paper copy and, an,
electronic copy: I think that will aid éverybody's use of the
document since we Nave got multiple people looking at, them, and.
then of course return the origimals to the Court.
