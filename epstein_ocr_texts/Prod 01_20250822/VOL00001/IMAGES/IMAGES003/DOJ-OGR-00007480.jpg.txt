testimony.” (cleaned up)). The government’s speculative concern about the effect of Dr. Dietz’s
testimony is no reason to exclude it when the Court has ample tools at its disposal to address the
governments (ill-founded) worries.

Almost as an aside, the government disingenuously suggests that Dr. Dietz’s opinion is
inadmissible because “it appears” to be based “solely on one interview of Epstein with Steven
Bannon.” Mot. at 17. As the government well knows, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is based on much
more. To be sure, Dr. Dietz quoted the interview in his disclosure, Ex. 1, p 6, but he also
reviewed and considered thousands of pages of material before reaching his opinion, including
most significantly all the material available to him about the Palm Beach Investigations of Mr.
Epstein, Ex. 1, p 166-69.

D. Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault.

The government misses the mark in its hyperbolic objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinions about
the multiple pathways to false sex assault allegations. Mot. at 18-22. The government claims
these opinions invade the province of the jury are unreliable and unhelpful. Not so.

First, the opinions do not invade the province of the jury because Dr. Dietz is not offering
an opinion on the truthfulness of the accusers’ allegations in this case. See Nimely v. City of New
York, 414 F.3d 381, 395—96 (2d Cir. 2005) (expert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s]
directly, under the guise of expert opinion, on the credibility of trial testimony from” specific
fact witnesses.); cf Hygh v. Jacobs, 961 F.2d 359, 364 (2d Cir. 1992) (expert not permitted to
offer testimony that “merely [tells] the jury what result to reach’). Dr. Dietz’s opinions rely on
his clinical experience and the vast body of literature explaining how an accuser might come to
falsely allege sexual assault.

One point (but by no means the only one) of Dr. Dietz’s opinion is to challenge the
reliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which she bases on the untested assumption that her
