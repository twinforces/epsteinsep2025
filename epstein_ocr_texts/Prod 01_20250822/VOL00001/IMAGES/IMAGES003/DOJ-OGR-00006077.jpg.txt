Presumption of Innocence and Burden of Proof
The law presumes the defendant to be innocent of all charges against her. She-Ms.
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to the charges in the Indictment. As a result, the burden is on the
Government to prove Ms. Maxwell’s the defeadants-guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to each
charge. This burden never shifts to the defendant for the simple reason that the law never
imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of testifying, or calling any
