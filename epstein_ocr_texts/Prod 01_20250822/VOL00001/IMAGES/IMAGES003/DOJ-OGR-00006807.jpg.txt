Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 452-1 Filed 11/12/21 Page 15 of 43
970 N. Bennett and W. O’Donobue
4, Inappropriate touching of the child (e.g., excessive tickling, hugging,
wrestling, sitting on lap).
5. Bribes for inappropriate contact (e.g., bribes for nonsexual or sexual
touching or bribes to meet the adult secretly).
6. Threats related to not participating in inappropriate contact.
7. Inappropriate isolation of the child (e.g., trips where the offender and
victim are alone that are not part of the normal adult—child relationship.
It is permissible for a father to drive a child to schooD, or inappropriately
discouraging the child to play with friends or be with family. For parents
or other caretakers, the threshold for what is considered inappropriate
behavior is higher than for other adults.
8. Favoritism directed toward the child (e.g., the child is treated much better
than siblings or classmates, particularly when this is intimate or isolating).
9. Boundary violations such as inappropriately bathing the child, clothing the
child, sleeping with the child, the adult being in underwear around the
child, the adult acting like a child, or the adult sharing private information
with the child, particularly sexual or relationship information (e.g., “my
wife and I are not having sex”). Again, for parents, family members or
caregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation
than for others.
10. Asking the child to keep secrets, particularly about their contact (e.g.,
the mother’s Christmas present would not be regarded as a problematic
secret, whereas asking the child to not tell that she was with the offender
would be).
11. Providing the child drugs or alcohol (note: although this behavior is
already abusive, it is not sexually abusive; thus, it can be consid-
ered a grooming behavior as it is inappropriate and serves to facilitate
compliance with the intended sexual abuse).
12. Misstating moral standards regarding touching, contact, or sex, particularly
when these relate to adult—child sexual contact or sexualizing a situation.
13. Repeated violations of the child’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom
when child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).
The more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s
behavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it
may be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming
behaviors that may be misinterpreted:
1. Purchasing appropriate gifts for the child (e.g., for birthdays).
2. Engaging in appropriate hand-holding (e.g., to cross the street).
3. Bathing a young child by a legitimate caregiver without any inappropriate

touching.
