halo effects when, making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one:mental
disorder influence the interpretation. of other symptoms indicative of other ‘mental. disorders and
viée Versa (sec ¢.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2017).

Halo effects are a‘means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to.a,
‘state in. which. attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts arc ‘aligned. Cognitive.
consistency scrves many important. goals. As noted by Read and, Simon (2012), cognitive
consistency is, “essential. for:rcasons. of parsimonyand cconomy'of.cffort, as Well as to allow for
the predictability ‘of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted.
sonsisteney is is. as basic a as. hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2012; D: 652), But because the world. is
often, not ‘so ncat, orderly; or unequivocal, humans chgage in complicated reasoning processes to
impose. consisténéy. These:processes involve bi-dircetional. reasoning in Which. “decisions follow
from evidence, and. evaluations ofthe evidence shift toward coherence with the emerging
decision” (Simon, Snow, & Read, 2004, p. 814; Greenspan, & Scurich, 2016). A's a. result,
perceptions and decisions become highly. skewed, toward one interpretation ‘while alternatives are
neglected or dismissed, hcnce consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs
unconsciously, i.¢., outside conscious awareness, and is not.intentional self-deception.

Halo.cffects can have scrious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham
(2016):

Once. unjustified initial expeetations are formed about a person, they can.
casily become sclfperpetuating with serious implications for. how:a target is:
treated, If we expect | a person to have positive. characteristics, we may
available (a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’, and positive impressions may in turn
léad to preferential. treatment in a range of domains:

interpersonal | relations, the'work:placc, the health.and legal:systems, and:even.
for decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)

Like many people. who achicve. great power and‘wealth, Jeffery. Epstein. ¢xploitéd ‘the, Halo effect
to surround.himsclf with. people: who would serve his.needs. .At.the most. primitive level, his
wealth,attracted.those ; secking for themselves some of'what he had. At the most sophisticated.
level, others with halos. of their own—through any combination of power, influence, fame,
brilliance, attractiveness, social standing, or other:positive charactcristics=mingled with Epstcin
for reasons of their own, and, being seen. if their company empowered him.and ‘made him look
above suspicion. Ina videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstcin differentiated. between
different kinds .of power—such as Bill. Clinton’s political: power, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’
physical power, and Gerry Edelman;s intellectual power—and acknowledged that, he gravitated.

The materials. reviewed reflect that Jeffrey. Epstein was a brilliant man who ‘was: flawed

by enduring personality traits familiar to psychiatrists as “Cluster B personality traits,” .found.
among those with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and:histrionic personality disorders.
