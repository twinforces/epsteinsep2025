1 defense now wants to include in its the defense objects but the
2 government doesn't is 226 and 404.

3 Is that right, Ms. Menninger.

4 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

S THE COURT: We'll move those two out of the agreed to
6 list and into the list of those for whom the defense objects

7 but the government doesn't.

8 Okay? Everybody understand where we are?

9 So, by my count then, making those changes, we have

10 231 prospective jurors for whom we agree should be called back
11 for voir dire. I believe that's a sufficient number to get to
12 the number of jurors that we need, so that's the list of jurors
13 that we will proceed to call back.

14 The way we're going to do it is we are going to aim

15 for 50 jurors a day, a morning session and afternoon session,
16 so we're breaking it so people aren't sitting around all day.
17 We'll direct a certain number to come in the morning, a certain
18 number to come in the afternoon. We'll get into the specific
19 logistics in a moment. But, that list of 231, my assumption is
20 that that will get us to the 50 to 60 qualified that I'm
21 planning on.
22 We have produced a list of those numbers with the
23 changes that I just noted, so the parties' agreed list with the
24 changes that I've just noted, so that gets us to the 231. I'll
25 ask my law clerk to hand that list out to both sides. And
