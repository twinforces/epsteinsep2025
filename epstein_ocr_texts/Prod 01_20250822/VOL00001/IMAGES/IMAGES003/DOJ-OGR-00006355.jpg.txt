individuals. I have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by

their first names only; however, those full names are known to the Government, the

defendant, and to the Court.

withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I

have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by their first names

only, or in some instances, by using a pseudonym. However, the full names of the

witnesses are known to the Government, the defendant, and to the Court.

The Government respectfully submits that the proposed instruction addresses any potential
