Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document565- Filed 12/19/21 Page 40 of 83
1 2. Did the Defendant knowingly and willfully associate herself with the criminal
2 venture?
3 3. Did the Defendant seek by her actions to make the criminal venture succeed?
4 If she did, then Ms. Maxwell is an aider and abettor, and therefore guilty of the offense.
5 If, on the other hand, your answer to any of these questions is “no,” then Ms. Maxwell is not an
6 aider and abettor, and you must find her not guilty under that theory.
