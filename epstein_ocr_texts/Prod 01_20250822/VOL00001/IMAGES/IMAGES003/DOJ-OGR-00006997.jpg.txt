I'm asking the government's position.

MS, POMERANTZ: Your Honor, we defer to the Court on
this.

THE COURT: I am prepared to rule ‘on this.

The request to file the joint proposed qtiest'ionnaire
and. voir dire under seal as well as the Court's proposed

questionnaire, which the government d6es not d6ppose, has been

requested by letter and, now argued here. Several. news

sealing the proposed voir dire and guestidnhaire. First,
there's no privacy interest in, a blank questionnaine, like the
kind 6f interest that. is articulated in Lugdsch v. Pyramid Co:

rationale for sealing the submission is t6 at. a general lével
avoid media coverage that may prejudice the jury selection
process. The jurérs are sworn to give true and compléte

jurors, and with the parties present, I feel confident that IL
can discern any clear ‘dishonesty. This is not just going to be
