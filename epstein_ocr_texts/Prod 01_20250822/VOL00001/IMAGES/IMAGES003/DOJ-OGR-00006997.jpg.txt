1 I'm asking the government's position.

2 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, we defer to the Court on

3 this.

4 THE COURT: I'll take that as you continue not to

10 and voir dire under seal as well as the Court's proposed
11 questionnaire, which the government does not oppose, has been
12 requested by letter and now argued here. Several news
13 organizations have opposed the request.
14 I do conclude that the defendant has failed to justify
15 sealing the proposed voir dire and questionnaire. First,
16 there's no privacy interest in a blank questionnaire, like the
17 kind of interest that is articulated in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.

19 rationale for sealing the submission is to at a general level
20 avoid media coverage that may prejudice the jury selection

24 jurors, and with the parties present, I feel confident that I
25 can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not just going to be
