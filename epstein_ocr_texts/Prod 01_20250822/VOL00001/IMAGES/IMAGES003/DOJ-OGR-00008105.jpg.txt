Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document508_ Filed 11/24/21 Page 20 of 25

‘These are just some of the many reasons why Rule’ 703 does not bar Dr. Hall’s testimony.
To the extent. the government,has other objections, it can. rais¢ those objections in context during
trial.
5. .Dr. Hall’s “fact testimony.”
As Dr. Hall’s report-makes clear,[7—

(__] never disclosed. any abuse by Mr. ‘Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Then, when interviewed for,
6 4 hours by’Dr. Hall;7—___] claimed ‘to have been abused by’Mr. Epstcin, but: she did

not allege any abuse or improper conduct by:Ms: Maxwell. This evidence is admissible as.a prior

‘inconsistent, statement.

To the extent.the government claims[——S—S—S—_| failure ever to implicate Ms.
Maxwell to[——_____] or Dr. Hall. isnot “inconsistent enough,” that argument goes'to weight,
not admissibility: See R.B. Ventures, Lid.v. Shane,No. 91CIV; 5678 (CSH),.2000. WL ‘520615,
at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 1, 2000) (extent of inconsistency “may provicuscful grist for the cross-
‘examiner’s mill,” but the argument “go[es] to. the weight of this opinion, testimony and.not its
admissibility”).

Indeed, this Court.has already: ruled:that:Ms. Maxwell can admit.evidence that]
[-—_ ] prior statements to law enforcement did not:implicate Ms. Maxwell. TR 11/1/2021, p
27. The same logic applies here.

The government says Ms. Maxwell. “does not need. Dr. Hall*s testimony to inform the:
jury that(—___] has not always disclosed the defendant’s role:in Epstein’s abuse.” Mot.
at 18. “Need,” of course, is not the test/for admissibility, and the government does not’ get to limit

Ms. Maxwell’s evidence only that which the government claims'she “needs.” See White, 692
