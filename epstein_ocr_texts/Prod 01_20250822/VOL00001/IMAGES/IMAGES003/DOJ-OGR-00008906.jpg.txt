before'trial and ruled that the submissions, ofthis issue Would remain under seal ‘until the
conclusion of the trial due to the: concern that public disclosure of the defendant’s extramarital

defendant’s right toa fair trial. /d.at *2,*8. Following the defendant’s conviction, Judge:

submissions no longer existed and. ordered them to be unsealed. Jd. at *8.

Maxwell’s right to 4 fair trial, it is necessary'to. temporarily scal the Motion (and likely any
additional submissions on,this issuc) for a short:period of time-until the Court rules on the Motion

or until any’ additional fact-finding process ordered by the Court is,complete. The Motion.and
