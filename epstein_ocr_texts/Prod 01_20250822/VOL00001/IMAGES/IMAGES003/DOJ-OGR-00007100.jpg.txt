1 says go to so and so's home at the following address â€”--

2 MS. MENNINGER: Or what is going to happen there and

3 why do I think it is going to happen there -- those kinds of

4 things -- that is really getting into the circumventing the

5 not-for-the-truth issue.

6 THE COURT: I don't think those other points could

7 come in because they would be for the truth.

8 MS. MENNINGER: Hearsay, right.

9 THE COURT: So they don't come in, obviously you can't
10 attack credibility.

11 Ms. Moe, do you disagree with any of that?

12 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. The government agrees. And
13 if this issue arises, we would certainly agree to a limiting

14 instruction about those out-of-court statements not being

15 offered for their truth. We don't anticipate that there would
16 be any testimony from an out-of-court declarant who is a victim
17 offered for its truth at this trial, and so we don't anticipate
18 option the door.

19 THE COURT: If the government thinks any of these, of
20 what it does intend to offer, is close to the line on that
21 question, it must raise them before inquiring or raising it in
22 opening.
23 MS. MOE: Certainly, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: OK.
25 Anything further on that?
