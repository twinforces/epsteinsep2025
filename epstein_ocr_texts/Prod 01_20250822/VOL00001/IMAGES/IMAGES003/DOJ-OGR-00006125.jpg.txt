The fourth. and final, element which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable 2 eee
doubt is that the overt act was committed for the purpose of carrying out the unlawful agreement. aa — ——o rasa ewe
The Goverment defers to the Court’s preference
In order for the Government to satisfy this element. it must prove, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that at least one overt act was knowingly and willfully done. by at least one conspirator, in
furtherance of some object or purpose of the conspiracy. as charged in the Indictment. In this
regard, you should bear in mind that the overt act. standing alone. may be an innocent, lawful
act. Frequently, however. an apparently innocent act sheds its harmless character if it is a step in
carrying out. promoting. aiding or assisting the conspiratorial scheme. You are therefore
instructed that the overt act does not have to be an act which. in and of itself is criminal or
constitutes an objective of the conspiracy.
