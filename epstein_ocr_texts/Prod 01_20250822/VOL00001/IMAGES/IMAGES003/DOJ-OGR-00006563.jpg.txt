Ill. The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and

Facilitates the Presentation of False Testimony

None of the identified purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey
Epstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for
their trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot cross-examine any identified
coconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be attributed statement. The
government’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged
accusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 801(d)(2)(E) statement attempting to
inculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,
for example,

Government Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?

Witness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert

expedient non-disclosed [statement]].

This is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.

In addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s
previously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns
about lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment
Delay, Dkt. 138. It has been difficult to track down and interview relevant percipient witnesses to
the alleged events. The failure of disclosure of critical alleged coconspirator statements makes it
impossible to prepare a defense.
