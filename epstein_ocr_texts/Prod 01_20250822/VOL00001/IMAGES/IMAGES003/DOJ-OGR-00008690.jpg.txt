] Instruction No. 50: Uncalled Witnesses â€” Equally Available to Both Sides
2 There are people whose names you heard during the course of the trial but did not appear
3 _ to testify. One or more of the attorneys has referred to their absence from the trial. I instruct you
4 that each party had an equal opportunity or lack of opportunity to call any of these witnesses.
5 Therefore, you should not draw any inferences or reach any conclusions as to what they would
6 have testified to had they been called. Their absence should not affect your judgment in any way.
7 You should remember my instruction, however, that the law does not impose on the
8 defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any
9 evidence.
