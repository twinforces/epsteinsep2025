Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 9of 93
All Parties Are Equal Before the Law
You are to perform the duty of finding the facts without bias or prejudice as to any party.
You are to perform your final duty in an attitude of complete fairness and impartiality.
The fact that the prosecution is brought in the name of the United States of America
entitles the Government to no greater consideration than that given to any other party to this
litigation. By the same token, the Government is entitled to no less consideration. All parties
stand as equals at the bar of justice.
Adapted trom the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United
States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 533 (AJN) and in United States v. Lebedev,
15 Cr. 769 (AJN).
