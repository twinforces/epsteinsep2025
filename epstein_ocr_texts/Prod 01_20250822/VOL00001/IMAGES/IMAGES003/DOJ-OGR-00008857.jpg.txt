There isa substantial probability that/Ms. Maxwell’s fair trial rights will be prejudiced if
the Motion ‘is unsealed ‘prior to the resolution. of the Motion.or prior to the completion of any’ fact-
gathering process or hearing ordered by. the Court. As previously discussed, unscaling the:Motion.
will give Juror 50 an:improper preview of the defense’s position at-any factual hearing the Court
may order, including the defense’s legal theories and arguments and our interpretation of the
underlying facts. It-will also give Juror 50. access:to information that he: should not have,
including a, summary of the additional evidence we have gathered, data about the responses of
other jurors arid ‘potential jurors to the jury questionnaire, specific defense requests for-prée-hearing
discovery, and the completed questionnaire itself, which. is currently:not publicly available and is
attached, as Exhibit 1 to the Motion.*

If Juror.50 has: access to this :information:in advance ofa factual hearing, should the. Court
order one, there is a substantial risk, that.he will tailor his answers, influence other witnesses, or
even destroy evidence, to ‘protect himself dnd explain away inconvenient facts. This will frustrate
the truth-secking purpose of the hearing as well.as Ms. :Maxwell’s efforts to vindicate:her right. to
‘a, fair trial. ‘Indeed, defense counscl is. effectively functioning ‘as a prosecutor with respect to'this
issué and the Motion sets forth ourtheory of the ease. ‘Unscaling the Motion, would be the
‘equivalent of'unsealing a.scarch warrant affidayit to: the subjects of a criminal investigation and

should be avoided for all the same'rcasons. Cf In-re: Sealed Search Warranis Issued Aine 4and 5,

* Whether Juror 50 should.be given-access to his‘completed j jury questionnaire in advance:of any hearing ordered by
the Court—and if-so,-how far in-advance—are questions that need-not:be7resolved:now and should be considered
separately at alater time. The:Motion, including; the completed questionnaire, should be sealed.in its entirety-until the
Court.decides on a-course of action.
