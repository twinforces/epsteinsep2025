There is a substantial probability that Ms. Maxwell’s fair trial rights will be prejudiced if
the Motion is unsealed prior to the resolution of the Motion or prior to the completion of any fact-
gathering process or hearing ordered by the Court. As previously discussed, unsealing the Motion
will give Juror 50 an improper preview of the defense’s position at any factual hearing the Court
may order, including the defense’s legal theories and arguments and our interpretation of the
underlying facts. It will also give Juror 50 access to information that he should not have,
including a summary of the additional evidence we have gathered, data about the responses of
other jurors and potential jurors to the jury questionnaire, specific defense requests for pre-hearing
discovery, and the completed questionnaire itself, which is currently not publicly available and is
attached as Exhibit 1 to the Motion.”

If Juror 50 has access to this information in advance of a factual hearing, should the Court
order one, there is a substantial risk that he will tailor his answers, influence other witnesses, or
even destroy evidence, to protect himself and explain away inconvenient facts. This will frustrate
the truth-seeking purpose of the hearing as well as Ms. Maxwell’s efforts to vindicate her right to
a fair trial. Indeed, defense counsel is effectively functioning as a prosecutor with respect to this
issue and the Motion sets forth our theory of the case. Unsealing the Motion would be the
equivalent of unsealing a search warrant affidavit to the subjects of a criminal investigation and
should be avoided for all the same reasons. Cf In re Sealed Search Warrants Issued June 4 and 5,
? Whether Juror 50 should be given access to his completed jury questionnaire in advance of any hearing ordered by
the Court—and if so, how far in advance—are questions that need not be resolved now and should be considered
separately at a later time. The Motion, including the completed questionnaire, should be sealed in its entirety until the
Court decides on a course of action.
