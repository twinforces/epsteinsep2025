Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 62 of 93
Statute of Limitations
There is a limit on how much time the Government has to obtain an indictment. Counts

Two, Four, Five, and Six are timelyâ€”that is, they are not barred by any statute of limitations.
As to Counts One and Three, in order to prove that this prosecution is timely, the Government
has to prove that least one of the overt acts in furtherance of that conspiracy involved a victim
other than Miner Victim [Jane Doe-3 pseudonym]. Put simply: you may not convict the
defendant on Counts One or Three solely on the basis of [Jane Doe-3 pseudonym] Miner
Vietim-3-or an overt act involving [Jane Doe-3_pseudonym|Miner Victim-3.
