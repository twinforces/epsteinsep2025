Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 92 of 93
CONCLUDING REMARKS

Members of the jury, that about concludes my instructions to you. The most important
part of this case, members of the jury, is the part that you as jurors are now about to play as you
deliberate on the issues of fact. It is for you, and you alone, to weigh the evidence in this case
and determine whether the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the
essential elements of the crime with which each-DefendantMs. Maxwell is charged. If the
Government has succeeded, your verdict should be guilty as to that DefendantMs. Maxwell and
that charge; if it has failed, your verdict should be not guilty as to that DefendantMs. Maxwell
and that charge.

You must base your verdict solely on the evidence or lack of evidence and these
instructions as to the law, and you are obliged under your oath as jurors to follow the law as I
have instructed you, whether you agree or disagree with the particular law in question.

Under your oath as jurors, you are not to be swayed by sympathy. You should be guided
solely be the evidence presented during the trial and the law as I gave it to you, without regard
to the consequences of your decision. You have been chosen to try the issues of fact and reach a
verdict on the basis of the evidence or lack of evidence. If you let sympathy interfere with your
clear thinking, there is a risk that you will not arrive at a just verdict.

As you deliberate, please listen to the opinions of your fellow jurors, and ask for an
opportunity to express your own views. Every juror should be heard. No one juror should hold
center stage in the jury room and no one juror should control or monopolize the deliberations.
If, after listening to your fellow jurors and if, after stating your own view, you become
convinced that your view is wrong, do not hesitate because of stubbornness or pride to change
your view. On the other hand, do not surrender your honest convictions and beliefs solely
because of the opinions of your fellow jurors or because you are outnumbered. Your final vote
