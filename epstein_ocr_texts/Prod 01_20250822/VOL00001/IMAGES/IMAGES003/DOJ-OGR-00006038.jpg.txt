Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 404 _ Filed 11/02/21 Page3of6

1 impartial in one kind of case, but for various reasons, related to their own life experiences or views,

2 can't be fair in another kind of case. The process that we use is designed to help us figure out

3. whether you can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case.
