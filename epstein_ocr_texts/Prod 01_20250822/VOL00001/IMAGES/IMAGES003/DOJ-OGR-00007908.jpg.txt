A. Absolutely not.

@. Can you explain that?

A. My role in a forensic capacity is to provide an, objective
answer based upon my evaluation and my review of the
literature. And it is not dependent on who is hiring me, for

looking for consistencies and inconsistencies in. what, the
individual is telling mé in order to form an opinion. AS part
of my duty in that role is to investigate various hypotheses,
in a forensic setting, it has to be that I'm not being told the
truth.
