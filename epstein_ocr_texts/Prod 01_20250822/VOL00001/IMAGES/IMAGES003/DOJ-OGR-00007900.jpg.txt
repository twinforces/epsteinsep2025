10 Q. What is grooming the environment?

11 A. It's a term that applies to commonly recognized phenomenon
12 and strategies, tactics, modus operandi used by perpetrators in
13 the service of getting them access to victims and building that
14 relationship of trust. So in addition to manipulating the

15 child, they'll manipulate individuals or institutions in that
16 child's life so that they're able to have greater access. So
17 they might, for example, befriend a child's parent and hold

18 themselves out as a trustworthy person who is going to help,

19 say, a single mom and he'll serve as a father figure to the
20 kid. Or they might groom an institution, they might work their
21 way up through the boy scouts, for example, and become a leader
22 there, become a pillar in the community to give them an air of
23 respectability, disarming, gaining trust.
24 Q. Are you familiar with the term attachment?
