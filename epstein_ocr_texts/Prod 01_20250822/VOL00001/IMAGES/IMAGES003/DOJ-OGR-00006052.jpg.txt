Assnic (2014); see:also New: York State Bar Association, Dec. 8, 201.5 Report.of the Social, Media
Committee of the Commercial and Federal Litigation Scction, at 15'(“[I]t-is not only permissible.
for trial counsel to conduct Internet research on prospective jurors, but [] it may even be
expected.”).

Other courts have acknowledged. that-using the internct'to conduct background :research
on prospective jurors. is.a. “rudimentary: practice” during jury ‘selection. United States v. Stone,
No. 19-0018 (ABJ), 2020.U.S. Dist: LEXIS 67359, at *93 (D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2020); see also
Garino v. Muenzen, No. A-5491-08T 1, 201.0'N:J. Super. Unpub, LEXIS 2154, at *27 (Super. Ct.
App. Div. Aug. 30, 2010) (trial judge erred in preventing counsel from using the internet; during’
jury selection). It:is so routine that.a party: who fails: to uncover disqualifying information.about
a:potential juror, despite a reasonable opportunity to-do so, risks waiving the right to use that
information :in post-conviction proceedings. Sione at *90, (denying motion to vacate conviction
and for a new trial. because, inter alia, “the defense could have discovered the [foreperson’s
social media] posts as.carly. as September 12, 2019, the day counsel received access to the.
completed juror questionnaires, including the foreperson’s, which had her name-printed legibly
on the'signature page.”).

Having additional time to conduct background rescarch.on each of the venirepersons is
‘the best way to ensure.a fair and impartial jury. Balancing the need:to protect juror privacy
against.Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair.and impartial jury weighs in favor of releasing the names of
potential. jurors to counsel upon the completion of their written questionnaires, not at! voir dire.

Respectfully submitted,
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM.
