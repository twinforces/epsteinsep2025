described with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories. This can occur when
people come to believe in these experiences and are not deliberately lying. Dr. Loftus would
identify some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.

Suggestive activities can explain how it is that a person might go from having no memory
of sexual abuse, and even denying sexual abuse, to later having “memories” for numerous
abusive acts, if the memories are false. She will explain the mechanism by which false and/or
distorted memories can be created as a result of post-event information and occurrences,
suggestion, influence or the like. She will also testify about the characteristics of false and/or
distorted memories. In particular “memories” can be described with confidence, detail and
emotion, even when they are false. She will point out some of the suggestive activities that
occurred in this case. She will explain how media coverage and other publications (including but
not limited to newspaper and magazine articles, news reports, television shows, documentaries,
books, podcasts, websites, etc.) and discussions/ conversations with others, can be sources of
suggestion. She will explain how, in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the
construction of distorted memories.
