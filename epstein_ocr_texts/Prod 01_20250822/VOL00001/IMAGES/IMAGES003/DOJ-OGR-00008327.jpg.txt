1 THE COURT: So I will allow -- I don't know if it's

2 admissible. I think, from what I see, it's a close question.

3 It's going to turn on the testimony. So I'll allow that

4 testimony to take place. I'll allow voir dire. And then I'll
a make a ruling, depending on how that goes, as to whether it

6 meets the threshold for admissibility, and the questions that

7 have been raised go to weight. But as I sit here, I don't know
8 until I hear that testimony.

9 I do think that the government needs to make it

10 available for inspection to the defense, and so you'll work out
11 the logistics of that pretrial. To the extent that they want a
12 forensic expert to look at it, a document forensic expert to

13 look at it, you'll work out the logistics to make it available.
14 OK?

15 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

16 THE COURT: Any questions about that?

17 MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor, other than one of my

18 requests was that the actual document be here at trial and not
19 a photocopy of one page.
20 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. The actual exhibit will be
21 here in the courtroom at trial. And we have already made that
22 exhibit available for the defense for inspection. They have
23 personally inspected it, I believe that was on November lst.
24 THE COURT: Great. I'm happy to hear that. And not
25 just the page but the whole book.
