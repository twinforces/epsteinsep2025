Instruction No. 17: Count Two: Enticement to. Engage in Mlegal Sexual Activity — Third
‘Element

‘The third element.of Gount Two which the Government must:prove beyond.a. reasonable
doubt.is ‘that Ms. Maxwell. acted withthe intent.that the individual:would engage in.sexual.
activity for which. any. person, can, be charged'with a criminal, offense under’ New: York, law.

“Intentionally” Defined

A-person acts intentionally when the act is the product. of her conscious objective, that:is,

when she acts deliberately and:purposefully and not because of a mistake or accident. Direct

proof of'a person’s. intent. is aliviost never available. It would be a raré case ‘where it could, be

shown-that.a, person wrote or stated that, as of a given.time,, she: committed an.act with a

‘particular intent. Such. direct.proof is not required. The ultimate fact of intent, though subjective,

nay be established by circumstantial. evidence, based:upon. the defendant’s. outward
manifestations, her words, her conduct, her acts and all the surrounding circumstances disclosed
by’the evidence and the rational, or logical ‘inferences that ‘may be drawn ‘from them.

Significant or Motivating Purpose

In order fo establish, this element, it-is not’necessary forthe: Government:to. prove’that;the
illegal. sexual activity;was Ms. Maxwell’s sole purpose for encouraging Jane'to travel. across. state,

lines. A person-may have several different: purposes or motives for such conduct, and. each. may:

‘prompt ‘in, varying degrees the person’s actions. ‘The government must. prove beyond a

‘reasonable doubt, however, that a significant or motivating purpose of encouraging Jane to travel

across state lines was that she would.engage in illegal ‘sexual, activity. In, other words, the illegal

sexual activity:must not have been:merely incidental to the trip.
