sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography’). To be sure, the
government’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-
reviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,
a review of grooming literature shows that grooming does not have a consistent definition and
“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie
Bennett & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child
Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2014).

Rocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider
of individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on
experience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and
she must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera
Familienstifiung v. Askin, 130 F. Supp. 2d 450, 530 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).* An expert relies “solely or
primarily on experience, the witness must explain how that experience leads to the conclusion
reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and how that experience is
reliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 702, Advisory Committee’s Note to the 2000
Amendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.

First, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her
patients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were
abused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also
no known or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a
series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating
[her] abuse.” United States v. Schneider, No. CRIM.A. 10-29, 2010 WL 3734055, at *4 (E.D. Pa.
* Abrogated on other grounds by Casey v. Merck & Co., 653 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2011).
