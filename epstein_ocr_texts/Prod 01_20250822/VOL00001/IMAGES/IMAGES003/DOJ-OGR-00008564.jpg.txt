‘Instruction No. 17; Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal, Sexual Activity — ‘Third.
Element

The third clement of Count. Two which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt is that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the individual, would engage ‘in sexual
activity for which any person can be: charged with.a criminal offense undér New York law.

“Intentionally” Defined

A person acts intentionally when. the act is the’product of her conscious objective, that is,
when she acts deliberately and purposefully and not beeause, of a mistake. of accident. Direct
proof of.a person’s intent is almost never available. It would-be a rare: case where it could be
shown that a person.wrote or stated that, as of a given time, she committed. an act. with.a.
particular intent. Such direct proof is: not required. The ultimate fact:of intent, though. subjcctive,,
may be established by circumstantial cvidenec, based upon the defendant’s outward
manifestations, her words, her conduct, her acts and.all the surrounding circumstances disclosed
by the evidence and. the rational or logical. inferences that may be: drawn from.them.

Significant or Motivating Purpose

In order to. establish this clement, it is:not necessary for the Government to prove that the
illegal sexual, activity was ’Ms.'Maxwell’s sole-purpose for encouraging Jane to travcl across state
lines. A. person may: have several different purposes, or‘motives for such, conduct, and each may’
prompt in varying degrees theperson’s actions. The government:must prove beyond a

reasonable doubt, however, that a, significant. or’motivating purpose of encouraging Janc to travel.

across state lines was that she would cngage in illegal. sexual activity. In other words, the illegal

sexual. activity must not have: been merely incidental to the'trip.
