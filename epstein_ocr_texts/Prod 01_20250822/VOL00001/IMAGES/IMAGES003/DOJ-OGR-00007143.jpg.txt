1 came from or how it was created.

2 The government says that it has a witness that is

3 going to say that that was Ms. Maxwell's book. I'm highly

4 suspect of that to begin with. And secondarily, that witness

5 wasn't around in 2004. And so we have now two witnesses for

6 this purported foundation, both of whom were not employed

7 during the relevant timeframe of the conspiracy. So I'm at a
8 loss, frankly, to understand how anyone could either

9 authenticate that document or admit it as some non-hearsay

10 document.

11 The government says well, even if it's not admissible,
12 then they will say as a business record -- the government says
13 we'll admit it for some other purpose, which I don't know what
14 that is. And if they're admitting it for another purpose, I

15 don't understand the relevance of this, given the inability to
16 establish a foundation and to tie it with any alleged conduct
17 that is part of the indictment in this case.

18 So I don't think we can just leave this here and then
19 have a discussion about this in the middle of trial. And it
20 seems to me that in this type of hearing, a pretrial hearing,
21 the government should say here's the witness that is going to
22 authenticate it, here's how they're going to authenticate it,
23 that is what we're authenticating it for, here are the pages
24 that we think are relevant and here's why.
25 We don't have anything of that information. We are
