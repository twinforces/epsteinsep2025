In order to establish this element, it is not necessary for the government to prove that the
| illegal sexual activity was she-defendantsMs. Maxwell’s sole purpose for transporting Jane Doe-

United States v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 366, 375 (2d Cir. 2013)
(“[T]he contemplated unlawful sexual activity need not be the
defendant's sole purpose for transporting a minor in interstate or
foreign commerce. Rather, it must only be a ‘dominant purpose’ of
the transportation.”); United States v. Miller, 148 F.3d 207, 212
(2d Cir. 1998) (finding no error in jury instruction that engaging in
illegal sexual activity “need not have been [the defendant’s] only
purpose or motivation, but it must have been more than merely
incidental; it must have been one of the dominant purposes of the
trip”).
