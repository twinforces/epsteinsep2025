Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
I write to inform the Court of the recurring problem regarding late delivery of mail by the
government to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC. Today, November 15, Ms. Maxwell received
disclosures from the government under cover letter dated November 6. This is an excessively
long delay, especially since trial commences in two weeks. Please direct the government to send
disclosures to Ms. Maxwell via Federal Express Next Day Delivery on the same day they are
provided to counsel and to provide tracking information to counsel.
Your assistance in resolving this persistent problem is greatly appreciated.
Very truly yours,
/s/
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
ce: All counsel of record
It appears that the mail referenced in this letter was sent prior to the Court’s
memo endorsement of the Government’s November 8, 2021 letter. Dkt. Nos.
422, 425. In any event, as this matter is less than two weeks before trial, the
Government is ordered to send materials via FedEx and provide the tracking
number to defense counsel. SO ORDERED.
