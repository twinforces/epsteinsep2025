ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of the parties’ letters. Dkt. Nos. 568, 569, 570. The Court hereby
sets the following briefing schedule for the Defense to move for a new trial in light of the issues
raised in the parties’ letters:

e Defense motion: January 19, 2022

e Government response: February 2, 2022

e Defense reply: February 9, 2022
The parties’ briefing should address whether an inquiry of some kind is permitted and/or
required, and, if so, the nature of such an inquiry. Although the Court reserves decision on
whether an inquiry of any kind is warranted, the Court grants the Government’s request, Dkt.
No. 568, to offer court-appointed counsel to the juror in issue. Subject to the juror’s right to
decline court-appointed counsel, the Court will appoint the on-duty CJA counsel to represent the
juror. If counsel for the juror wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an
inquiry, briefing by the juror’s counsel may be filed by January 26, 2022.

The Court will not adjourn post-trial briefing on other issues as requested by the Defense,
Dkt. No. 569, but sets the following schedule for any other post-verdict motion by the Defense:
