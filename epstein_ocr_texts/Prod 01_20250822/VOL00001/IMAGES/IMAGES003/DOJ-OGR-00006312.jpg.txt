ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

Attached is the Court’s revised draft preliminary remarks to be recorded and played
before each voir dire session. The Court is in receipt of the Government’s letter approving of the
remarks, Dkt. No. 420, and the Defendant’s proposed additions, Dkt. No. 419. The revised
remarks adopt all but one of the Defendant’s proposals because the Court’s subsequent revisions
eliminated that portion of the script. In particular, the Court has made three additional changes
in order to accurately explain the logistics of voir dire. Each of these changes is reflected in
redline.

The parties are ORDERED to indicate by letter on or before November 11, 2021 at 12:00
p-m. whether or not they have any objections or suggestions the Court’s revised preliminary
remarks to be played before each voir dire session.

Attached is also the Court’s revised draft voir dire in redline. The Court’s revisions
simplify the phrasing of questions 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 25, and 37 in an effort to maximize the time
dedicated to questioning each prospective juror. The revision to question 11 reflects the Court’s
oral ruling on November 1, 2021 regarding the use of pseudonyms for certain witnesses. The
revisions to questions 9, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, and 33 are non-substantive changes to question
