ill. CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION - SUBMISSION, EVALUATION AND DETERMINATION
A. Claims Submission Process

Individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have
otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before the
Effective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including Instructions
for completion and submission of the Claim Form and a copy of this Protocol. Individuals who have filed
a lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to
be eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain
free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals
must, however, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at
the time of acceptance of a compensation determination offer in order to receive payment.

Individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have
not otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before
the Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program’s website at
www.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire setting forth their
name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested
information. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the
individual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is
eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant
Program information.

Note: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates
that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It
does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive
compensation. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has
been submitted and evaluated by the Administrator.

Registrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the
Estate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their attorney to the
Administrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective
Date through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline (“Registration Deadline”). It is important
to note that the Registration Deadline is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained
above, all claims must be filed by the Filing Deadline.
