was accurate. Gov. Letter at 8. But that argument would work.only ifthere were evidence that
the 20.1.9 photos look.liké what photos ‘from 1994 or ‘1995 or 1.996 would have looked like. And
as the government: docs not deny, there’s no.such evidence.

The government: does not dispute that; it.could have asked Jane to authenticate the photos
by: showing the photographs to her when.she testified. Gov..Letter at 8 n.3. According’to the
government, however, “[bJefore showing the photographs to Jane’on the’ stand, the Government
would.surely ned. to, show her the photographs in advance,” arid that would have “vitiat[ed] the
photographs’ value: as independent corroboration.” Jd. This is.a.bascless argument.

The government; casily could have: showed the photographs, to Jane for the first time
during her'testimony, asked her ifshe recognized them, asked 'whether the photos. accurately
depicted the house and massage:room as it existed in 1.994 or 1995 or 1996, or at least asked if
the photographs looked:similar:to what:the apartment looked like back then. In. turn, once the
government clicited testimony from.another witness about when:the photographs were taken, it
could have moved.to admit them. This procedure’would, have addressed the government’s
concern, about preserving the photographs as indépendent, corroboration of Jane’s testimony. The
‘only conceivable thing, stopping the government:from doing this‘was a concern. that-Jane would
not give the answer'the government wanted,

But'even if this procedure would. have “vitiat[ed] the photographs’ valuc as. independent
corroboration,” that’s just howtrials go. Sometimes tradcoffs are necessary to comply with, the
rules of evidence. And having to:make:such,a'tradcoff does not: mean. Ms. Maxwell'was wrong'to

object or the Court was wrong'to sustain.
