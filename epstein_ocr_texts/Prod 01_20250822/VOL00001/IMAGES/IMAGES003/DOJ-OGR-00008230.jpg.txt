was accurate. Gov. Letter at 8. But that argument would work only if there were evidence that
the 2019 photos look like what photos from 1994 or 1995 or 1996 would have looked like. And
as the government does not deny, there’s no such evidence.

The government does not dispute that it could have asked Jane to authenticate the photos
by showing the photographs to her when she testified. Gov. Letter at 8 n.3. According to the
government, however, “[b]efore showing the photographs to Jane on the stand, the Government
would surely need to show her the photographs in advance,” and that would have “‘vitiat[ed] the
photographs’ value as independent corroboration.” /d. This is a baseless argument.

The government easily could have showed the photographs to Jane for the first time
during her testimony, asked her if she recognized them, asked whether the photos accurately
depicted the house and massage room as it existed in 1994 or 1995 or 1996, or at least asked if
the photographs looked similar to what the apartment looked like back then. In turn, once the
government elicited testimony from another witness about when the photographs were taken, it
could have moved to admit them. This procedure would have addressed the government’s
concer about preserving the photographs as independent corroboration of Jane’s testimony. The
only conceivable thing stopping the government from doing this was a concern that Jane would
not give the answer the government wanted.

But even if this procedure would have “vitiat[ed] the photographs’ value as independent
corroboration,” that’s just how trials go. Sometimes tradeoffs are necessary to comply with the
rules of evidence. And having to make such a tradeoff does not mean Ms. Maxwell was wrong to
object or the Court was wrong to sustain.
