Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563_ Filed 12/18/21 Page 33 of 167
1 Instruction No. 23: Counts Two and Four: Failure to Accomplish Intended Activity is
2 Immaterial
3 Now, with respect to Counts Two and Four, it is not a defense that the sexual activity
4 which may have been intended by the Defendant was not accomplished.
5 In other words, it is not necessary for the Government to prove that anyone, in fact,
6 engaged in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense with
7 the individual after she was enticed, for Count Two, or transported, for Count Four, across state
8 lines. It is enough if the Defendant has the requisite intent at the time of the enticement or
9 transportation.
