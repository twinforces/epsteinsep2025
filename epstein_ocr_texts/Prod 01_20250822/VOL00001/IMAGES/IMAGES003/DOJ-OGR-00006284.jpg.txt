When parsing these domains, it can be more clearly seen how BPD may
serve as a pathway for false allegations of sexual assault. The first domain
(Leib et al., 2004) includes the diagnostic criterion of quickly switching from
idealization to devaluation of relationship (American Psychiatric Association,
2000). The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD
may be rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant
others or lovers to devaluing them (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).
This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feel-
ing that the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion
of abandonment. The rapid shifting between idealizing and demonization
may bring about a change in perspective such that a relationship that was
viewed idealistically in the past is now seen through the devalued lens of
abuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse”
and may lead a person with BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual
assault.

As Kanin (1994) found in his longitudinal study, two of the three major
motivations to file a false allegation of rape were attention-seeking and
revenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship
and/or relationship partner (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) may
spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devalua-
tion phase, newly construed as mistreatment. In addition an individual with
BPD who is feeling fear of abandonment may seek frantically to achieve the
attention that is craved from the partner who is perceived to be neglectful
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The impulsive nature of a person
with BPD may also lead them to act on these motivations for attention or
revenge by filing a false allegation of sexual assault before carefully consid-
ering the consequences. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with
BPD engage in behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative” (Linehan, 1993).
Manipulative behaviors are often outside the conscious awareness of the
individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as manipulation
frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an indi-
vidual with BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting
a third party for some desired outcome.

The second domain (Lieb et al., 2004), consisting of symptoms of
reality-based delusions and hallucinations, may lead to false beliefs of sex-
ual assault, and clinical experience suggests that sexuality is a common
theme in delusions and hallucinations. The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric
Association 2000, p. 299) defines delusions as “erroneous beliefs that usu-
ally involve misinterpretations of perceptions or experiences.” Hallucinations
involve sensory experiences that do not appear to be externally
caused.

Thus, individuals with BPD may represent a “perfect storm” of symp-
toms in which an impulsive, emotionally dysregulated individual who is
demonizing someone and has loose contact with reality and who is seeking
