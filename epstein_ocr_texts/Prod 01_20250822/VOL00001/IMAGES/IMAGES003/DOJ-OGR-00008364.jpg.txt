“The attorney-client privilege protects from disclosure (1) a communication between
client and counsel that (2) was intended to be and was in fact kept confidential, and (3) was made
for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.” Jn re County of Erie, 473 F.3d 413, 419
(2d Cir. 2007). “The burden of establishing the attorney-client privilege, in all its elements,
