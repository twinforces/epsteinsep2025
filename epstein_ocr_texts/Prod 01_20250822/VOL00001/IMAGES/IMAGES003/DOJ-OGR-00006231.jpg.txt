subject. were disbelieved. Her knowledge’ and intent, are no different. if she participated in the
conspiracy duc to the Halo effect or for some other rcason.* Dr. Dictz’s opinions on this topic
simply do not tend.to negate: any ‘clement or.establish any defense.

Instead. of serving any ‘proper purpose, the apparent. intent behind offering Dr. Dictz’s
opinion on. the “Halo effect” is:to. cngcnder sympathy'for the defendant. But juriés.are. not. “to act.
based ‘on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming, 838 F. App’x. 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2021)
(summary order); sce; e.g-, United States v. Mustaga, 753 F. App’ x 22,37 (2d.Cir. 2018) (summary’
order) (“The district.court.correctly recognized that evidence-of solitary confinement.could beused
for the improper purpose of provoking juror sympathy.”). Any attempt. to encourage such.
sympathy is therefore an attempt at nullification, which:is itself plainlyimproper. See, ¢.g., United
States v. ‘Thomas, 116 F.3d 606, 615 (2d Cir. 1997) (Jury nullification ‘is “by no means a right or
‘something that a judge should, encourage or permit if it is within, his ‘authority to ‘prevent.”); id.
at 614 (“We categorically reject the idca that, in a socicty committed ‘to the rule of law, jury
nullification is desirable or that ‘courts may permit jt to occur when it is ‘within their authority to
prevent.”); see also United States v. Washington, 705 F.2d 489, 494 (D.C. Cir: 1983) (per curiam)
(“A jury-has nomore ‘righ? to find a ‘guilty’ defendant ‘not guilty” than it has:to find a “not guilty’
defendant ‘guilty,’ and the fact that the former cannot be corrected by a court, while'the latter can,
be, does not.create.a-right out of the: power to misapply the law. ‘Such verdicts are lawless, a denial

‘of duc:proccss and.constitute an exercise of crroncously seized. power.” (emphasis in. original)).

* Evidence. ofthe. deferidant’s. motive. may be relevant evidenee proving the offerise, but evidence
that a.“tHalo effect” gave the defendant.a motive to:commit the:crime has no relevance as defense
