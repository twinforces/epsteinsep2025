1 MS. MOE: The government respectfully submits that

6 jury would be free to conclude from those e-mails that the

7 defendant is serving a particular role with respect to the men
8 that she is e-mailing with.

9 THE COURT: Are you suggesting like some kind of

10 financial arrangement?

11 MS. MOE: No, your Honor.

12 I think the issue, as reflected in our briefing, is

13 that a jury may wonder at this trial about the relationship

14 between Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein and why Ms. Maxwell would
15 be willing to serve in a particular role with respect to

16 Mr. Epstein, and it is probative of that issue that she is

17 serving a similar role, albeit in a different context, with

18 other men during that same time frame.

21 and aiding and abetting the transport and enticement of minors
22 to engage in illegal sex acts and the commercial sex act
23 e-mails setting up dates between non-minors or meetings,
24 however you want to describe it, involving non-minors are not
25 direct evidence of the crimes charged, they don't arise out of
