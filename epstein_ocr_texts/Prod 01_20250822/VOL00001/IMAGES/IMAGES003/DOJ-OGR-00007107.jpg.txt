LB1 5MAX 2:

MS. MOE: The government respectfully submits that

although the defense is free to characterize these as dates,

the tenor of the e-mail suggests that she is offering wp women
largely based on descriptions based on. physical descriptions
and not in sert of a matchmaking capacity. And so, T ‘think the
jury would be free to conclude from those e-mails that the
defendant is sérving a particular role with respect to the men
that she is e-mailing with.

THE COURT: Are you Suggesting like somé kind of
finaneral arrangement?

MS. MOE: No, your H6nor.

I think the issue, as reflected in oun briefing, Ls
that a jury may wénder at. this trial about the rélatadénship
between Ms. Maxwell and, Mr. Epstein and, why Ms. Maxwell would
be willing to serve in a particular réle with respect to
Mr. Epstein, and it is probative of that issue that she is
serving a Similar role, albeit in a different. context, with
other men during that same time frame.

THE GOURT: On the 6smails,; I am excluding then.

The indictment charges the defendant with conspiring
and aiding and abetting the transport. and enticement. of minors
e=whails setting up dates betweeh noh=minors or meetings,
however you want to describe it, involving non-minors are ‘not,

direct evidence of the crimes charged, they don't arise out of
