requested relief is unprecedented.

The Defense raises several specific arguments in‘favor.of its unprécedented request.
First, the Defense argues that. anonymity is necessary to protect its witnesses from. scrutiny:and
harassment because of the significant publicity this case has garnered. But these generalized.
‘circumstances that prior courts have found justify the use of pseudonyms. ‘Further, the alleged
victims that reccived. pseudonyms during'the Government’s case have. a statutory ‘right to have
their “dignity and privacy” protected. ‘18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8). The.Defense’s witnesses have no
similar right.

Perhaps most analogous to Deferidant’s request is United States v. Rainiere, United. States
v:, Rainiere, No. 18-CR-204S 1 (NGG), 2021 WL 4522298 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 20211), another
high-profile case involving alleged sexual, misconduct. ‘There, after a defendant pled, guilty, the:
defense sought to keep letters submitted in support of the defendant at sentencing anonymous,
arguing that anonymity was necessary because:“the authors of supportive |ctters may ‘face
retribution if their identities are publicly known, given the public attention, that; has becn paid to
this case” and.that.failure to: do so:“will. have a:chilling effect on individuals who wish. to speak:

in support of defendants ‘in, other high-profile prosecutions.” Jd, at*3—4. The court

acknowledged the individuals’ “genuine interest in assisting sentencing while remaining out of
the public:cye themselves,” but concluded that their letters about: the defendant did.“not involve
traditionally private matters” and that;the public’s interest-in access prevailed. Jd. at*4. The
Court concludes ‘thatthe. same analysis applics here.

Second, and relatedly, the Defense argues that without pseudonyms, jts’‘witnesses may

refuse to testify; implicating Ms. Maxwell’s right to‘present a defense. The'Court ‘notes the late:
