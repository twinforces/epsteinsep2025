Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 427 Filed 11/09/21 Page6of16

1 is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on any evidence and a

2 ‘juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice.

3 The next thing is that as jurors you must follow the law as I give it to you, even if you

4 don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.

5 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in

6 the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in

7 discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on

8 something that you might have read or heard about another case.

9 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not
10 permitted to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts
11 of this case at all. If you see something in the paper or online, you're just going to have to turn
12 the page or close the browser. You can't read it.
13 Equally important, you're not permitted to discuss this case with anyone else while the
14 case is going on. Even with your fellow jurors, you can't discuss the case until you've heard all
15 the evidence and I’ve given my instructions on the law. Again, that's because you can only
16 consider the evidence that you hear in the courtroom, not anything outside of the courtroom. You
17. have to keep an open mind. Nor may you discuss the case with friends or family until after your
18 jury service is complete. You can tell them that you are a juror in a criminal case in federal court
19 and that the judge has told you that you are not permitted to say anything further.
20 Similarly, until you are excused from jury service, you cannot post anything about your
21s‘ experience as a juror on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok or any kind of social media.
22. Another instruction, you can't look up or google or do any other kind of research or search in any

23 manner about anything related to the case or anyone involved in the case.
