is not.guilty: That means a defendant docs not have to testify, or to’put on any evidence ‘and a
juror can't hold’that against a defendant. if she makes that choice.

The next-thing is'that as jurors you-must follow the law as I give:it'to you, even if you
don't agree with it or'if you. think the law should be different.

You also have t6 base 'your‘verdicton the evidence, not.on something:that’you've :read in
the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about:on social media ‘or in,
discussions ‘with fricnds, family, or colleagues. And you can't base'your decision in, this case on
something that you. might have read or heard. about another ‘case.

As’ said before, there is significant:media interest in this case. As jurors you, are not
‘permitted to rcad.any news about this case. You.cannot:read or’watch or listen to any accounts
of this case at all. If you sce something in’the paper ‘or online, you're:just going to have to turn
the page or close the browser. You. can't read it.

Equally important, ‘you're not permitted to, discuss this ease with anyone else. while the
‘case is going on. Even with-your fellow jurors, you can't discuss the case until you've heard.all
‘the evidence ‘and I’ve given my‘instructions on the law. Again, that's, because you can only:
‘consider the evidence that you hear in:the courtroom,, not-anything, outside of the:courtroom. You.
haye to keep.an,open:mind. Nor may you discuss the case with friends or family until after your
jury service is complete. You can tell them that you.are: a juror in a.criminal. casé ‘in federal court
and that the judge has told.you.that_you are: not permitted'to say anything further.

Similarly, until you ‘are excused ‘from jury service, you cannot-post.anything about your
experictice. asa juror on.Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok or any kind of: social. media.

Another instruction, you can't look up or google or do any other'kind ‘of research or search in any

manner about anything related to the case! or anyone involved in the case.
