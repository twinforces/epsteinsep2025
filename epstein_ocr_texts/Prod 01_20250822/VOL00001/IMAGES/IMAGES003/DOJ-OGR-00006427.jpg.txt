to issues that are definitely set for trial, without lengthy argument at, or interruption of, the trial.”
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. L.E. Myers Co.
Group et al., 937 F. Supp. 276, 283 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (same). Evidence should be excluded on a
motion in limine only when the evidence is clearly inadmissible on all potential grounds. See
Baxter Diagnostics, Inc. v. Novatek Med., Inc., 1998 WL 665138, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25,
1998); Natl Union Fire Ins. Co., 937 F. Supp. at 287.

The way the government has raised its purported “in limine” motions is disfavored. Like
the government’s motions here, where a party “endeavor{[s] to strike in shotgun fashion at whole
topics and sources of prospective evidence, out of context and before any specific objection
against its proper backdrop is raised...,” the strategy is “impermissible” and the motions should
be denied. TVT Recs. v. Island Def Jam Music Grp., 250 F. Supp. 2d 341, 344 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).

Where the in limine motion seeks to preclude evidence or argument regarding various
defenses it “is plainly improper.” United Realty Advisors, LP v. Verschleiser, No. 14-CV-5903
(JGK), 2019 WL 5285043, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2019); see also United States v. Overton, No.
15-CR-9S, 2017 WL 6347084, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 13, 2017); United States v. Morel, 751 F.
Supp. 2d 423, 427-28 (E.D.N.Y. 2010).

B. Advisory Rulings are Not Appropriate Here

Out of context, the government attempts to preclude whole categories of potential
defenses, argument, and cross examination before one witness has testified. See Sections III, IV,
IX (“The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument”), V (The Court Should Preclude
Challenges), VII (“the Court Should Require the Defense”), VII ("The Court should not
Permit”), X (“The Court Should Preclude the Defense’’), and XI ("The Defendant Should be
Precluded”).
