Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document535 Filed 12/09/21 Page5of8

3140366, at *4 (E:D.N:Y. 2017) (“The Court:is unaware of any authority. that authentication of
emails can only come through a ‘witness with:dircct knowledge of the drafting, and, Defendant
provides none.”).

Concluding that Mr. Alessi’s testimony ‘sufficiently authenticates GX. 52, follows this:
well-tread path. Mr. Alessi’s testimony. established. an intimate familiarity with:the distinctive
directories used in,the Palm Beach household. over many years and during the time period ‘of the
charged, conspiracy: He testificd. that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of.
binding, ‘cover, and information. ‘This testimony: of. the appcarance, ‘content,, substance, and. other.
distinctive characteristics of the exhibit is sufficient to satisfy Rule 901.”

The Deéfense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not:its adiniissibility.
See lin Yat Chin, 371 F.3d.at.38. For example, Mr..Alessi was crossed.on voir dire that he did
not have personal knowledge about the creation of GX,52 or how the exhibit:had been,
maintained. since it was allegedly removed ‘from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknowledged
that he'would not know whether GX 52.had-been altered in some ‘way; such as whether pages
had. been added or'whether it had been rebound. Nor could he explain the addition, of Post-It:
notes and other pencil markings: in the otherwise type-face book. Trial. Tr. at 872-75. But it is
well scttled.that “any flaws in the chain, of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and.
not on its admissibility.” United States v. Sticke, No. 06 Cr. 339 (RPP), 2007 WL 2962594, at
arguments as to the Government’s possession of the document or how it has becn maintained, do
not go'to authentication. See A/ Earekh, 81.0. App’x. at’ 25 (“Although,the, Government. did not’
present cvidence-regarding the ‘circumstances surrounding the seizure of the USB drive, ..... any

? The Court notes that this conclusion does not:rely onthe Government’ s.citation-in its December 8, 2021, letter to
the transcript of. Ms. Maxwell's. April 2016:civil deposition.
