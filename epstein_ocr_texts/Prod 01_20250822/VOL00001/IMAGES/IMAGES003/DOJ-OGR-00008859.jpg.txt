sealed for only: a limited ‘period of time and because the defense is not-sceking to seal. any ‘hearing
ordered. bythe Court, there ‘is no concern that the public-will be permanently: denied access to the
documents or the relevant facts, or that the press. will beunable’to perform its role of monitoring
‘the federal courts. See:Amodeo IT, 71, F.3d at: 1050. The defense’s sealing request is, therefore
narrowly tailored and outweighs the public’s qualified:right of acecss to the documents. ugosch,
435 F.3d at 124 (scaling is justified if it:is “necessary to preserve higher values” and ifthe scaling
order is “narrowly. tailored to: achieve that aim”).

It's also not feasible to file. a redacted-version of the Motion on.the public docket in. the
meantime. Although the Motion contains some publicly available information and a discussion of
the relevant law, these:portions of the Motion reflect the defense’s legal theories and interpretation
of the facts and should not be disclosed to Juror 50. For example, the defense’s selection, of which
publicly available ‘facts to highlight .in the Motion provide a roadmap of which topics the defense
might.ask Juror 50 about at a,hearing. Similarly, the Motion discusses the implications of certain
public:statements Juror 50 has given in the'past, which, may impact.the responses he gives, to
questions at.a hearing. Finally, the case law cited reveals which legal-theorics the defense may:
pursue, which may also impact Juror 50’s responses. In, such, situations where it is too difficult or
impractical. to 'rédact a:document, courts allow the document to be fully scaled. See 1186 Fo6ds,
