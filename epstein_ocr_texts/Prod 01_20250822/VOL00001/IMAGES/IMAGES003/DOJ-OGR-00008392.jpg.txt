Defense may of course raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of
questioning into witnesses’ backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass,
or otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 133 (1968) (emphasizing
that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to protect a witness “from
questions which go beyond the bounds of proper cross-examination merely to harass, annoy or
humiliate him”).

SO ORDERED.
