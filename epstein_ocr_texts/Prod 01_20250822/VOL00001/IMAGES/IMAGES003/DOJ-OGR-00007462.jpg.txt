presented here in open colirt by the parties. This is critically important to ensuring

a fair trial — which. know that all. of you'would want if you. were a party in this

Court and Ihave no doubt:is what you. want for the parties who are here today. J

expect you to inform me immediately through Ms. Williams if you become aware

of another juror’s violation, of these instructions.

Finally, each of you has been given a notebook and pen. That is because ]

permit jurors. to take notes. But you donot have to take notes. Notes are just an.
aid to'your own recollection. The court reporters in this case record everything
that: is said in, the courtroom and any portion of the testimony. can be read back to
you. during your deliberations. Ifyou do take notes, be aware ‘that note-taking may
distract you from something important that is happening on the witness stand.
Whether or not you. take notes, rely .on your own. recollections, and don’t’be
influenced, by the fact that another juror has taken notes. Tf you do take notes, all
notes ‘must be left each. day in, the jury room. Ms. Williams will:make sure that,

they are secure.

From this. point until. the time when you retire to deliberate, it is your duty

not to discuss this.case with anyone and ‘not to remain ‘in the presence of other

persons who may be discussing this case—this includes discussions even with,

that the parties and counsel.in. this case have been. instructed to have :no contact
