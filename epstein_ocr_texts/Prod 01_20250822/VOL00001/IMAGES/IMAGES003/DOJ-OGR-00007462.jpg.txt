Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page10of11

1 presented here in open court by the parties. This is critically important to ensuring

2 a fair trial — which I know that all of you would want if you were a party in this

3 Court and I have no doubt is what you want for the parties who are here today. I

4 expect you to inform me immediately through Ms. Williams if you become aware

5 of another juror’s violation of these instructions.

6 Finally, each of you has been given a notebook and pen. That is because I

7 permit jurors to take notes. But you do not have to take notes. Notes are just an

8 aid to your own recollection. The court reporters in this case record everything

9 that is said in the courtroom and any portion of the testimony can be read back to
10 you during your deliberations. If you do take notes, be aware that note-taking may
11 distract you from something important that is happening on the witness stand.
12. Whether or not you take notes, rely on your own recollections, and don’t be
13. influenced by the fact that another juror has taken notes. If you do take notes, all
14 notes must be left each day in the jury room. Ms. Williams will make sure that
15 they are secure.
16 From this point until the time when you retire to deliberate, it is your duty
17 not to discuss this case with anyone and not to remain in the presence of other
18 persons who may be discussing this case—this includes discussions even with
19 members of your own family, and your friends. In this regard, please understand
20 ‘that the parties and counsel in this case have been instructed to have no contact
