determined that “(t]he government’s evidence at. this early juncture ‘of the case appears’ strong”
based on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. in
scrious crimes.””:as'well as corroboration.in.the form:of “significant.contemporancous.,documentary
evidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that. the defendant’s history and. characteristics
demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In. addressing ‘that third. factor, the Court

by: the defendant’s “significant financial.resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding
those resources and herself.” (Ji: at 87). The Court emphasized that. the defendant’s. “recent.
conduct underscores her €xtraordinary capacity to evade detection, even. in the face of what. the

‘defense has. acknowledged to be ‘extreme and. unusual. efforts to locate her.” (/d.). The: Court
