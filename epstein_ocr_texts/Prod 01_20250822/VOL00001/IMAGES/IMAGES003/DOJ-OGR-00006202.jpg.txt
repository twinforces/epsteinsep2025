minor victims and the potential penalties those charges carry. U/d. at 82). Second, the Court
determined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”
based on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in
serious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary
evidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics
demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court
emphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”
including “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least
one foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of
France, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses
extraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the
defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources
available.” (Ud. at 83-84).

Accordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating
that the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive
conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found
that although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full
accounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not
opaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That conclusion was informed
by the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding
those resources and herself.” (/d. at 87). The Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent
conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the
defense has acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). The Court
