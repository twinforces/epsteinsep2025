can arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely
believes that it was not.

False Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of
controversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated
memories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were
given short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked
to try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed how subtle
information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her
students have conducted more than 200 studies with more than 20,000 participants
demonstrating how misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating
false memories.

Intoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of
sexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the
validity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating
substances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was
intoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was
under the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may
attempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that
occurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,
a person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which
for some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.

Antisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is
a pervasive pattern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins
in early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with
antisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve power and pleasure, a false allegation of
sexual assault might be the means by which he or she attempts to achieve power over the falsely
accused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of
remorse could allow the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this
allegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of
sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false
claim of assault.

Borderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious
mental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in
interpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid
switching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline
personality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may
be rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to
devaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling
that the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid
shifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that
a relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is now seen through the devalued lens of
abuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person
