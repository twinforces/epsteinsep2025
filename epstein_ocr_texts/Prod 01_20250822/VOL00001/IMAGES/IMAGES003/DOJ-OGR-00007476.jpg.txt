Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 499 _ Filed 11/23/21 Page11o0f 28

Third, the government says. Dr. Dictz:should. not be’ permitted totestify that. it is a.
“commionly accepted bit of clinical lore” that:perpetrators often target vulnerable victiins. Mot: at
11. The government’s argument misconstrues and. misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr. Dictz
docs not dispute that vulnerable people can’be and. are targeted. Ex. 1, p 4.’But what the, scicnec
arc not characterized as “vulnerable.” /d, There is no.comparator, and there is thus no‘way to:
know how representative “vulnerable victims” are of all victims, of abuse. /é,.As, Dr. Dietz will
testify; experts do not know'the empirical. relationship between vulnerability and abuse. Jd.
Again, Dr. Dictz:should’be able to challenge the reliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions by
explaining how they lack’ scientific support. Fed. R. Evid. 702, Advisory Committee: Notes, 2000
Amendments (Rule 702 “is broad. cnough-to permit testimony that is the product of competing
principles or methods in the same field of expertise.).

Fourth, the, government disputes Dr. Dictz”s opinion that there is no authority supporting

misunderstands Dr. Dietz.s point, and its argument is correspondingly non-responsive. ‘The
government says, for’example, there is “ample literature on the pimp-prostitute relationship.”
Mot. at.12. Dr. Dictz does not deny this. But unless the government, (to use its crude vernacular)
is saying that the accusérs were the:prostitutes, Ms. Maxwell'was the pimp, and. Mr. Epstein was
the John, this literature is. beside the point and:not applicable to this ‘case: Ex. 1, p 4.

3K KK:

* To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony’ on, this point, addressing or implying
‘“srooming-by-proxy,” Dr: Dietz’s opinion is admissible as described hercin. Séee:a/so stipra note
