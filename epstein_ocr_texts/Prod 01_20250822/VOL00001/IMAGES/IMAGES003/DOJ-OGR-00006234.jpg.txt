can be either true or false, and offering an “expert” opinion that allegations can be false is simply
prejudicial, not only inviting the jury to speculate about the frequency of false allegations but
giving the incorrect impression that they are common. Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such
testimony that false accusations “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on
cross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A
at 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that
false allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at 101 (citing study estimating the frequency of false
rape allegations between 2% and 10%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire
topic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific
allegations are in fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be precluded
from offering this opinion.

Many of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they
are at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 702 for an
expert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false
accusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such circumstances is
squarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need
the help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d
® The Government typically cannot introduce evidence of the statistical infrequency of false
accusations, but if Dr. Dietz is allowed to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only
fair to allow the Government to correct the record. United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1296
(2d Cir. 1991) (“The weighing of relevance under Rule 403 may be altered when a false impression
is created by earlier testimony. That is, evidence whose probative value might not ordinarily
outweigh its prejudicial effect if offered on direct examination is admiss[i]ble to rebut testimony
elicited on cross examination that created a false impression.” (citations omitted)).
