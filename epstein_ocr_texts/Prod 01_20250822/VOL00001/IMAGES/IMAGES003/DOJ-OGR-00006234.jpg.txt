canbe cither true or false, and. offering an “expert” opinion that allegations can be false is simply
‘prejudicial, not only inviting the jury to speculate: about ‘the frequericy of false allegations but:
giving the incorrect impression that they are common. Indeed, if Dr. Dictz secks.to offer :such.
testimony ‘that: falsc ‘accusations. “do occur,” it will open, the door forthe Government to clicit: on,
cross-cxamination, that Dr. Dictz’s priticipal sourec, which he. relics on “néarly verbatim” (Ex. A,
at 7), concludes that “the most recent-more methodologically adcquate studies: have indicated. that
false allegations are somewhat. rare” (Ex. C ‘at 101.(citing study estimating the frequency. of false
rape allegations between 2% and ‘10%)).° Of course, the Government’s view. is that this entire
topic can serve only to distract the jury from, its task of determining whether these specific.
allegations are in. fact proven beyond a:reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dictz should be precluded,
from offering this opinion.

Many ofthe “pathways” Dr..Dictz deseribes are ‘not just within the ken, of the jury, they

‘expert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implicd consent,” or“‘intoxication” could lead to a false
accusation of a crime. Sorting out; witness credibility, mistake, or other such. circumstances is
squarcly the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need

the help of a psychiatrist:to assess such possibilities. See, e.g. United States v, Mulder, 273 F.3d.
