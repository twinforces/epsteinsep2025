Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 91 of 93
Right to Hear Testimony; Election of Foreperson; Communications with the Court; Juror
Note-Taking

You are about to go into the jury room and begin your deliberations. The documentary
evidence will be sent back with you. If you want any of the testimony read to you, that can be
arranged. But please remember that it is not always easy to locate what you might want, so be as
specific as you possibly can in requesting portions of the testimony that you might want.

Your first task as a jury will be to choose your foreperson. The foreperson has no greater
voice or authority than any other juror, but is the person who will communicate with the Court
through written note when questions arise and to indicate when you have reached your verdict.

Your requests for testimony—in fact, any communications with the Court— should be
made to me in writing, signed by your foreperson, and given to one of the Marshals. I will
respond to any questions or requests you have as promptly as possible, either in writing or by
having you return to the courtroom so I can speak with you in person. In any communication,
please do not tell me or anyone else how the jury stands on the issue of the jury’s verdict until
after a unanimous verdict is reached.

For those of you who took notes during the course of the trial, you should not show your
notes to or discuss your notes with any other juror during your deliberations. Any notes you have
taken are to assist you and you alone. The fact that a particular juror has taken notes entitles that
juror’s views to no greater weight than those of any other juror.

Finally, your notes are not to substitute for your recollection of the evidence in this case.
If you have any doubt as to any testimony, you may request that the official trial transcript that
has been made of these proceedings be read or otherwise provided to you.

Adapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United
States v. Lebedev, 15 Cr. 769 (AJN), in United States v. Jones, 16 Cr.
553 (AJN), and in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151 (AJN).
