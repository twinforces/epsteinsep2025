Rule 901(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that “[t]he requirement
of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by
evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent
claims.” See also Ricketts v. City of Hartford, 74 F.3d 1397, 1409 (2d Cir.1996); United States v.

1984). A motion in limine to preclude evidence calls on the "[C]ourt to make a preliminary
determination on the admissibility of evidence under Rule 104 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence.” Highland Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Schneider, 379 F. Supp. 2d 461 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

to rule in advance of trial on the admissibility and relevance of certain forecasted
evidence.” Dougherty v. County of Suffolk, No. CV 13-6493 (AKT), 2018 WL 1902336, at *1
(E.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).
