PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

The Government respectfully moves t6 preclude certain opinions from Dr. Park Dietz atid
Dr. Elizabeth Loftus. ‘Rather than focus narrowly on reliable opinions that. would be relevant to
issucs, in this case, the defendant. proposes, to have Dr. Dietz and. Dr. Loftus, testify broadly about:
‘a. wide varicty of topics, from testimony: about various psychological. disorders to testimony
regarding the generation of false memories in laboratory settings, that, are not helpful to the jury.
Mani. of those opinions are. also unreliable, squarely'within the ken of the average juror, or'would,
invade the:provinee of the Court. and.the:jury if offered.

To the extent Dr. .Rocchio is permitted, to testify on. her opinions, the Court should, admit.
reliable opinions.on the samé topics by defense experts. But the defense’s, expert notice for Dr.
Dietz and Dr. Loftus is far more expansive, and some of the defense’s responsive opinions arc not:
reliable. The Court:should preclude many‘of their opinions.

A. Background.

As described in the defense expert notice, attached as, Exhibit .A.', the defense offers the

‘opinions of Dr. Dictz, an expert psychiatrist, both, in response to the Government’s expert Dr. Lisa.

Rocchio and on several other subjects.

‘The Government moves to file a redacted version. of Exhibit A and. to scal Exhibit B. The:
proposed redactions are: consistent with the three-part test articulated. by: the Second. Circuit .in,
Lugosch.v Pyramid Go. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 11:0 (2d Cir..2006). Although these exhibits are:
judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to protect'the privacy intérests. of victims, ineludingvictims. who have :not becn.
publicly identified, and. who area subject of the Court’s order g granting the motion to let certain.
victims and witnesses testify ‘under. pscudonyms, and third parties. Because the: Government has
already moved.to file a redacted. version of” Exhibit..A (see Dkt. No. 418), the same version is
attached to this motion.
