A. The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About. Charging.
Decisions or Possible Reasons for Them

1. Applicable Law

Federal ‘Rule of, Evidence: 402 provides. that “[i]rrelevant. cvidence ‘is not admissible.”
Accordingly, any evidence that does not. bear on. the deferdant’s guilt or infiocence of the

13. Cr. 58 (KBF), 2013. WL 6020773, at. *2 (S:D.N:Y. Nov. 1, 2013) (precluding cross
