Starting’ with. the first:element, what is,a conspiracy? A. conspiracy 1s an agreement or an

‘understanding, between.two or more persons, to accomplish by. joint action a. criminal. or

unlawful purpose:

people to violate the law. As. I :mentioned earlier, the-ultimate: success. of the conspiracy, meaning

‘the actual commission of the crime that isthe object: ofthe conspiracy, is‘not an element ofthe

crime of conspiracy:

In order. to show that a.conspiracy: existed, the evidence: must. show that two or more

‘people, in some way or.manner, through any contrivance, explicitly. or implicitly (that 1s, spoken,

or-urispoken), cainé to.a mutual understanding to violate the law arid:to. accomplish aii unlawful

‘plan. Express language or specific: words are not-required to indicate assent or attachment to a

conspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came’to an

‘the Government will have sustained its’ burden of proof as to'this element:

‘tells:you that-when. people, in fact, agree to. enter into a.criminal, Conspiracy: much.is left to the.

unexpressed understanding. [tis rare that a conspiracy can be: proven, by direct evidence of, an
