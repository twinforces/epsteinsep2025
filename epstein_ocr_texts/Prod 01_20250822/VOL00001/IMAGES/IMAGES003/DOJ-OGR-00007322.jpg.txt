1 MS. POMERANTZ: No objection, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: Is admitted to the hearing record.

3 (Defendant's Exhibit B received in evidence)

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: If we could pull up Exhibit 6, please.
5 THE COURT: Government 6?

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, please.

7 BY MR. PAGLIUCA:

8 Q. Exhibit 6 is the study that you appear to have relied on

9 with regard to disclosure issues. Is that correct?

10 A. It's something I submitted in part, yes.

11 Q. Well, as you sit here today, can you tell us anything else
12 that you submitted with regard to your testimony about delayed
13 disclosure and supporting literature?

14 A. I couldn't give you a list, but, again, my opinions are not
15 based on any one article or even solely on my knowledge of the
16 literature. It's based on an interaction of the totality of my
17 education, training, skills, experience, and knowledge of the
18 scientific and clinical and professional literature.

19 Q. OK. So looking at Exhibit 6, this is a survey,
20 essentially, of a number of publications that talk about
21 barriers of disclosure. Correct?
22 A. So my understanding is, this was a study that was looking
23 at, understanding that delayed disclosure is very common, they
24 were trying to determine what sorts of things present as
25 barriers to disclosure and as facilitators of disclosure.
