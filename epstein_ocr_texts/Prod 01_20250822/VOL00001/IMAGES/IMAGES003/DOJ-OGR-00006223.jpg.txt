Rules. 401 and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence state that ‘relevant evidence is
admissible: when it tends ‘to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence more: or less
probable: than it would. be without the evidence, but it may be excluded. if its probative: valuc is
‘substantially outweighed by, among other things, the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion. of the:
issues, and. misleading the jury. “Expert.cvidence can be both. powerful and quite.:misleading
because of the difficulty in ‘evaluating it. Because of this risk, the judge in, weighing ‘possible:
prejudice against probative foree under Rule 403 . . ..cxercises'more control over'experts than over:
lay’witnesses.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at. 595 (quoting authority omitted).

Among other things, the Court “must consider whether an expert’s proposed. testimony
would. usurp: thé province of the judge. to instruct. on the law, or of the jury to make factual
determinations.” sland Intell. Prop. LLG v.. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 09 Civ..2675 (IKBF),.2012
WE 526722, at;*2 (S.D:N-Y. Feb. 1.4, 2012) (citations omitted). While Federal Rule of Evidence

704(a) provides that “[a]n 6pinion:is not'objectionable:just because it embraces an ultimate issuc,”
the Second Circuit has admonished courts to take care: “lest [the expert] be allowed. to ‘usurp the
function, of the judge.” Marx & Co. vy. Diners Clitb, Ine, 550 F.2d 505, 511, (2d Cir: 1977).
Accordingly, courts must not admit “opinions which. would merely: tell the jury what result to
reach.” Hygh, v. Jacobs, 961, F.2d 359, 363-64 (2d.Cir. 1992) (quoting Fed. 'R. Evid. 704 advisory:
committee’s note)? séé also, United. States ¥. Ditncan, 42 F.3d 97, 101, (2d Cir. 1994) (When. an
expert undertakes. to tell. the: jury what result to reach, this docs not wid the jury in making a
decision, but rather attempts.'to substitute: ‘the expert’s judgment for the jury’s.” (emphasis iin,
original)). Nor may‘an.expert'opine as to a:party’s state of mind, credibility; intent, or motive. See
