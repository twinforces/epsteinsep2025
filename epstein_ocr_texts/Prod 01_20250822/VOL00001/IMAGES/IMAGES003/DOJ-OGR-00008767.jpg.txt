Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document565_ Filed 12/19/21 Page 61 of 83
1 Nor may you use evidence that I have instructed you was admitted for a limited purpose
2 for any inference beyond that limited purpose.
3 In addition, you may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of participating in criminal
4 conduct merely from the fact that she associated with other people who were guilty of
5 wrongdoing or merely because she has or had knowledge of the wrongdoing of others.
6 Here again, let me remind you that, whether based upon direct or circumstantial evidence,
7 or upon the logical, reasonable inferences drawn from such evidence, you must be satisfied of
8 the guilt of Ms. Maxwell as to each count charged before you may convict her as to that count.
