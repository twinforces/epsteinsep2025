LB1LTMAX3:

THE COURT: ‘Wé"1ll pick up with Defense 4. This is the

issue of evidence related to alleged Victim-3,

Defense seeks to excludé evidence relatéd to this

individual that's mot probative of the charged conspiracy and

‘inadmissible urder 404(5) and 403. There are redactions issues
here. Redact.ions of specific identifying information is
permissible here. I don't think that redactions as to some
general background. -information that dees not reveal specific
identifying informdatiion regarding ‘the alleged Victims. is
necessary, but. we'll proceed bearing in mind the requested
redactions.

I want to begin this one with questions for the
government: Ms; Moe, so it's. a hypothetical. I gather there's
statute of limitations issues, but setting the statute of
lamitations issue aside, if the only evidence in the case
pertained to this individual, LE all the testamony of ‘this
individual is acceptéd by the jury, céuld the defendant be
found guilty of any crimes charged in ‘the indictment?

MS. MOE: Wath respect; just so I understand the

hypothetical, if the only count in, the indictment were the Mann
Act conspiracy ==

THE COURT: No, any of the crimes changed, just.

Stipulate to that, but if the only evidence pertains to this
individual.
MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. The answer is no. In
