Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 465 Filed 11/15/21 Page 67 of 127 67

1 THE COURT: We'll pick up with Defense 4. This is the
2 issue of evidence related to alleged Victim-3.

3 Defense seeks to exclude evidence related to this

4 individual that's not probative of the charged conspiracy and

5 inadmissible under 404(b) and 403. There are redactions issues
6 here. Redactions of specific identifying information is

7 permissible here. I don't think that redactions as to some

8 general background information that does not reveal specific

9 identifying information regarding the alleged victims is

10 necessary, but we'll proceed bearing in mind the requested

11 redactions.

12 I want to begin this one with questions for the

13 government. Ms. Moe, so it's a hypothetical. I gather there's
14 statute of limitations issues, but setting the statute of

15 limitations issue aside, if the only evidence in the case

16 pertained to this individual, if all the testimony of this

17 individual is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be

18 found guilty of any crimes charged in the indictment?

19 MS. MOE: With respect, just so I understand the
20 hypothetical, if the only count in the indictment were the Mann
21 Act conspiracy --
22 THE COURT: No, any of the crimes charged, just
23 stipulate to that, but if the only evidence pertains to this
24 individual.
25 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. The answer is no. In
