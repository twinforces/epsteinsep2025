Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document562_ Filed 12/17/21 Page 29 of 82

1 Instruction No. 21: Count Four: Transportation of a Minor to Engage in Illegal Sexual

2 Activity — Second Element

3 The second element of Count Four which the Government must prove beyond a

4 reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with

5 the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal

6 offense in violation of New York law.

7 Like Count Two, Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be

8 charged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55, Sexual Abuse in the Third

9 Degree. I have already instructed you regarding that crime, and those instructions apply equally
10 here.
11 In order to establish this element, it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the
12 illegal sexual activity was Ms. Maxwell’s sole purpose for transporting Jane across state lines. A
13. person may have several different purposes or motives for such conduct, and each may prompt in
14 __-varying degrees the person’s actions. The Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,
15 however, that a significant or motivating purpose of Jane’s travel across state lines was that she
16 would engage in illegal sexual activity. In other words, the illegal sexual activity must not have
17 been merely incidental to the trip.
