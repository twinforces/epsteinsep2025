Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document480_ Filed.11/21/21 Page 7 of9

This‘trial will turn on the credibility of the individuals accusing Ms. Maxwell of these
crimes. The Court should allow broad, cross-cxamination during the trial on general issues of bias
and, motive for fabrication to protect-Ms. Maxwell’s rights. under the Confrontation.Clausc of the
United States Constitution. A criminal, defendant “states a. violation of the Confrontation, Clause
by showing that [s]he. was prohibited from engaging :in. otherwise. appropriate. cross-cxamination
designed to'show a.prototypical form of bias on the part of thewitness, and thereby ‘to: expose to
‘the jury the ‘facts from which jurors could appropriately draw inferences relating'to the reliability:
of the witness.” Delaware vy. Van.Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673 (1986) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415
US. 308,318, (1974)). “[T]he exposure of a witness” motivation in testifying is a proper and
important function. of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.’” Olden’.
economie reward is classic impeachment material. Wnited States v. Bagley, 473 U:S. 667,684,
(1985).

Full. and complcte:cross-examination of the Accusers is impossible without'understanding
the complete terms of the agreement with, the Epstcin Fund, including the claims concerning Ms.
Maxwell, as ‘well. as ‘others. Cf’ Moore. Marr, 254 F.3d 1235, 1244 (10th. Cir. 2001) (noting that
witnesses’ “application for victim compensation payments and. application for and reccipt of
emergency victim. compensation payments may well have been “favorable” within. the meaning
of Brady,” requiring. government disclosure of exculpatory evidence:to criminal defendants);
payments and promises made to cooperating witnesses. Sec also, United States v. DeLeon, 428 F:
‘Supp. 3d 675, 697 (D.N.M. 20.19); and Wiited States v, Sedaghdt¥, 728 F.3d 885, 898 (9th Cir.
2013), “Impeachment evidence is especially likely to be material when jit impugns the testimony”

of witnesses “critical to'the prosecution's case.”
