leave to the jury whether such behaviors occurred in this case. Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,
in his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and subjective. (/d. at 4). But it
invades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute
motive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to
reach.” Hygh, 961 F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Third, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims
is “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot
be verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For
instance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving
teachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as
problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See
Bennett & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual
Abuse 957, 964 (2014), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have
recognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children
with “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have
already been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” 12 J. Sexual Aggression
287, 292 (2006), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omitted)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is
supported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well
established. Dr. Dietz must do more to show the reliability of his view than simply call this
literature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.

Fourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”
(Ex. A at 4). To the extent that Dr. Dietz is pointing to the fact that the term “grooming-by-
