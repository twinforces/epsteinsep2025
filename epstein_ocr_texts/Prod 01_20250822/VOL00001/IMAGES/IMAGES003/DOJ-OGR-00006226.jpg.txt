leave to the jury whether such behaviors occurred:in:this case. Dr. Dietz. is free to tell the jury that,
in. his view, assessing whether grooming occurred. is difficult and subjective. (/d. at'4). But it.
invades'the province of the jury'to go a further. step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence:to impute
motive or ‘intent. This is, in, the ‘most direet way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to
reach.” Hygh,.961 F.2d. at 364 (internal quotation. marks omitted).

Third, Dr. Dictz-proposes to ‘opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable'victims
is “a Commonly. accepted bit-of clinical lore” that.is ‘unsupported by.any empirical data and cannot.
berverified. (Ex. A at 4). /his claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For
instance, an article cited by Dr. Dictz describes a. literature ‘review of sexual abuse involving

recognized that“[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” :such,as:children,
‘with “a-poor relationship ‘with their parents,” who “do, not. have many: friends,” or: who “have
already been.victimized.” (Craven ct al.,. “Sexual grooming of. children,” 12.J. Sexual. Aggression.
287, 292 (2006), Dkt. No..397 Ex. A (citations omitted)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical, experience is
supported, by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ ‘targeting of vulncrable'victims is ‘well
established. Dr. Dictz must do more: to show the reliability of his view than simply call this
literature “‘clinical lore” and, complain, about the lack of data.

Fourth, Dr. Dietz states:that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”

(Ex. A at 4). To the:extent that ‘Dr. Dictz is pointing to the fact that the term. “grooming-by-
