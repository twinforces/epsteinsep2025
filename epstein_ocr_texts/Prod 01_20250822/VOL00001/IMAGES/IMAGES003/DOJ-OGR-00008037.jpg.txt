Dear Judge Nathan: Me \\ ik
' na on 11/24/21
We represent Jordana H. Feldman, the independent administrator of the Epsteim Victims’
Compensation Program. We write regarding the Court’s order, dated November 22, 2021,
denying Ms. Feldman’s motion to quash Maxwell’s subpoena to her and ordering production of
the subpoenaed documents by November 24, 2021 at noon.
Ms. Feldman intends to comply with the Court’s order and produce responsive
documents to the Court. However, given the volume of materials and the steps necessary to
ensure that documents produced fall within the scope of the subpoena, it is not possible to
produce all materials by noon tomorrow. We understand that the volume of potentially
responsive materials is approximately 6,000 to 7,000 pages, and we note that the original return
date for the subpoena was November 29, 2021 at 8:30am.
| SO ORDERED.
We are available should the Court have any questions.
Respectfully submitted,
/s/ Patrick J. Smith
