1 And as I said, we'll discuss voir dire and take up

2 questionnaire issues as needed.

3 So that's Monday, November 15th.

4 I would also like to just go ahead and schedule what
5 will be our final pretrial conference for November 23rd, is

6 what I propose, in the afternoon. I still need to work through
7 the logistics and space and timing on that, use that to clear
8 out any remaining issues or motions in advance of trial.

9 Ms. Pomerantz, how does that sound to the government?
10 MS. POMERANTZ: That all sounds fine. Thank you.

11 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

12 MS. STERNHEIM: That sounds fine. I just have a

13 question with regard to the commencement --

14 THE COURT: Could you pull up the mike.

15 MS. STERNHEIM: Oh. sorry.

16 With regard to the commencement of voir dire, what

17 time will we begin on the 16th?

18 THE COURT: I believe 9, but I will confirm and see
19 what time I believe -- what time we think the jurors will
20 actually be ready to go, checked in and ready to go, and I'll
21 work backwards from that, give us time to get set up and
22 address any preliminary issues. So let's assume 9 and I'll
23 confer with the jury department.
24 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
25 Just a moment.
