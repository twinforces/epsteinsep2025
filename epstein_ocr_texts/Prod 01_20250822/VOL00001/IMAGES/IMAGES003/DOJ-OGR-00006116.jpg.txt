(DLC). See also United States v. Rea, 958 F.2d 1206, 1214 (2d Cir.
1992) (“In order to prove conspiracy, the government need not
present evidence of an explicit agreement; proof of a tacit
understanding will suffice. The coconspirators need not have
agreed on the details of the conspiracy, so long as they have agreed
on the essential nature of the plan, and their goals need not be
congruent, so long as they are not at cross-purposes.” (citations
