1 jury department, the D.E.'S Office to make sure we are ready

2 for the upcoming proceeding.

3 As I've noted, the primary purpose of today's

4 conference is to go through the questionnaire and voir dire

5 procedures for jury selection. I've received the parties'

6 joint proposed questionnaire and voir dire. The defendant

7 filed a motion regarding the voir dire procedures, and I've

8 considered those submissions as well, Dkt. No. 341, and the

9 government's response at 355.

10 I've also, in coming to resolution as to how to handle
11 these procedures, considered examples of questionnaires and

12 voir dire used for jury selection in many high-profile matters
13 by my colleagues in this district and other districts. I've

14 reviewed and studied case law on the subject, including

15 Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., 464 U.S. 501

16 (1984); Presley v. Georgia, 558 U.S. 209 (2010); U.S. v. King,
17 140 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 1998); and ABC, Inc. v. Stewart, 360 F.3d
18 90 (2d Cir. 2004). And of course, all of this must be

19 considered in conjunction with the district's COVID-19
20 protocols.
21 As to that, as I noted, I've worked closely and
22 extensively with the very hardworking folks in the clerk's
23 office, including the jury department and the D.E.'S Office, to
24 map out plans for how to effectuate my determinations as to the
25 best way to proceed under all of these factors and
