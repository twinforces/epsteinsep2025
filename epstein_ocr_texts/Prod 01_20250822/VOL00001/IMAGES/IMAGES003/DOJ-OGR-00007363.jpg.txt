The Protocol for receiving compensation is attached as Exhibit 1 to Attachment A. The
Protocol requires a written submission. The claims are evaluated per the Protocol which credits
“whether there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the appropriate
Office of the District Attorney, United States Attorney’s Office, or other law enforcement
agency.” Accordingly, the Protocol credits claimants who have had charges filed against Epstein
or any employee of Epstein. The June 2019 indictment against Epstein did not include the
allegations of the four Accusers that are contained in the S2 Indictment charging Ms. Maxwell.
Under the terms of the Protocol the Accusers here, and their civil lawyers, stood to benefit if the
prosecution against Ms. Maxwell went forward. The Protocol also rewards Accusers who have
filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Epstein, or the Estate, which
includes any employees or former employees of Epstein. Lawyers for yy
were instrumental in creating and structuring the terms of the Protocol. 3

The documents sought are obviously relevant -- statements of the Accusers about what
they claim happened for purposes of securing a settlement. Similarly, the amount of
compensation is also relevant. "Relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make
the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable
or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” United States v. Malpeso, 115 F.3d 155,
162-63 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 410).
