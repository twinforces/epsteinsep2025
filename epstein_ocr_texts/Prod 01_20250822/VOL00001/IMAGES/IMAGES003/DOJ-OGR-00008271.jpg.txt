Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document532 _ Filed 12/09/21 Page7of8
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan
December 8, 2021

faulted for pursuing a line of cross-examination that took the government at its word regarding
its theory of admissibility and relevance and its plan to call Employee-1 as a witness to lay the
required foundation.

CONCLUSION

The government will rest either tomorrow or Friday, and it is long past time for the
government to have presented evidence to authenticate Exhibit 52 and to lay the foundation for
its admission. Because the government has not met its burden, this Court should exclude Exhibit
52, a book Mr. Alessi was unable to identify or authenticate, a book Ms. Maxwell was never
shown during her deposition, and a book that was stolen and missing for several years, offered
for sale in an extortion scheme and altered in untold ways.

This Court should reaffirm its decision not to admit Exhibit 52.
