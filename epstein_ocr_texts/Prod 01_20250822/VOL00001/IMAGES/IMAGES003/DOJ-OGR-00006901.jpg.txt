Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 453 Filed 11/12/21 Page 21 of 52
C. Ms. Maxwell reiterates her request to defer briefing and ruling on the
admissibility 0f TT [EE 2nd exhibits for two
weeks.

For the reasons already detailed, the complexity of the issues and the fact that Jy
HEE «ecently disclosed testimony appears to be of utmost centrality to the government's
case, Ms. Maxwell repeats and reiterates her request that she be afforded additional time to
submit a comprehensive motion in /imine concerning the introduction of this testimony and
exhibits as supposed direct evidence of the charged conspiracy. In that there remains a full
month before opening statements, Ms. Maxwell's fundamental rights to present a defense, to
have the effective assistance of counsel, and to a right to confront witnesses and subpoena
witnesses to testify in her defense all will be preserved by a small delay on this issue.

I. THIS COURT SHOULD EXCLUDE LISA ROCCHIO'S TESTIMONY UNDER
FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 702 AND DAUBERT V. MERRELL DOW
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) AND GRANT A DAUBERT
HEARING
A. This Court should reject the government’s arguments to the extent that they are

based on newly disclosed material, which this Court ordered the government to
produce six months ago.

Recognizing that Rocchio’s proposed testimony is on shaky ground (to say the least), the
government belatedly tries to shore up its case and hoist up its expert witness. Two days ago, and
six months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first
disclosed to defense counsel about 300 pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in
reaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to save
Rocchio’s testimony from exclusion. See United States v. Lewis, 818 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir.
2020) (unpublished) (affirming exclusion of defendant’s proffered expert evidence “that did not
adhere to the discovery schedule”).
