Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563_ Filed 12/18/21 Page 75 of 167
1 Instruction No. 53: Use of Electronic Communications
2 Some of the evidence in this case has consisted of electronic communications seized from
3 computers or electronic accounts. There is nothing illegal about the Government’s use of such
4 — electronic communications in this case and you may consider them along with all the other
5 evidence in the case. Whether you approve or disapprove of the seizure of these communications
6 may not enter your deliberations.
7 You may, therefore, regardless of any personal opinions, consider this evidence along
8 with all the other evidence in the case in determining whether the Government has proven the
9  Defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. However, as with the other evidence, it is for you
10 to determine what weight, if any, to give such evidence.
