United Kingdom law are irrelevant.!4 See United States v. Vasquez, 82 F.3d 574, 577 (2d Cir.
1996) (appropriate to reject defense request for an instruction if it does not “represent[] a theory
of the defense with a basis in the record that would lead to acquittal”). And the proposed jury
instruction that the sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 “cannot be considered ‘illegal’ or
‘criminal’ or ‘unlawful’ for purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment” (Def. Mot. 4 at 15),
is wrong on the law. The sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for
purposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of the defendant’s
guilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in contrast, creates serious risk that
the jury will think the Court is telling them that the conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to
the case. It is not irrelevant: it is direct evidence of the crimes charged, and it should be put before
the jury.

the Court’s order, the identities of the individuals the Government intends to argue are co-
conspirators at trial. The defense nonetheless asks the Court to enter an order precluding the
Government from introducing any co-conspirator statements under Federal Rule of Evidence
‘4 Tn the event the Court instructs the jury on the age of consent in the United Kingdom, the
Government requests that the Court also instruct the jury that the United Kingdom’s age of consent
is irrelevant and they should not consider it.
