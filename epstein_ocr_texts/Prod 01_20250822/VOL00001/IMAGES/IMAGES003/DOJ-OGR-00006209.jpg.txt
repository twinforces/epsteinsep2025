The defendant’s latest’ bail, application docs not meaningfully engage with the Court's
previous findings and reasoning. Nor does it identify’ any intervening change in,law or factual
cireumstanec. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes better suited to tabloids than
‘briefs. ‘Where Icgal arguments: can be found, they are cursory: and ‘unpersuasive.

With respect. to:risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in
which she-asserts that she“‘is:not a flight:risk” because she“‘is a mature adult” who, has “proclaimed,
her innocence” and therefore “[t]here:is:no indication. that she would. attempt to flee given her
personality profile and, determination, to be cxonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory
assertions were also made. in her‘prior bail applications, which. have. been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.
findings about. the defendant’s substantial ‘international tics, multiple forcign citizenships, familial
and. personal. connections abroad, owncrship of at Icast: onc: foreign. property: of significant-valuc,
lack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to cvade detection.

The defendant’s ‘primary argument, consists of allegations and. complaints about the
conditions. of. her confinement, which are: loosely tied to the claim.that such. conditions impair. her
ability to prepare ‘for trial. But these same complaints. have becn'a;part of. cach. of the defendant’s
bail applications, (see, é.g.,.Dkt. (18 at'7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. 171 at’9-10), aswell as numerous
‘other submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained.close oversight of
those conditions," and cnsured. that. the defendant. has ample ‘time fo review her discovery and,
prepare for trial—more'time, in fact, than any other inmate atthe: MDC. (Second Order at 20). And

the Court. has repeatedly. found that. the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial, has ‘not. been,

' For. example, in response to'the defendant’s most:recent :complaint—regarding the timing of her
transportation, to Court—the Court: directed. the Goyernment to confer with the BOP and. United.
‘States Marshals Service, and. the Government.is providing ‘a. letter addressing the ‘issuc today.
