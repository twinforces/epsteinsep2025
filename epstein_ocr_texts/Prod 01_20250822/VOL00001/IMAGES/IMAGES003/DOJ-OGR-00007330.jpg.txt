1 this particular article. I have extensively reviewed

2 underlying data as it pertains to this subject over the course
3 of my career.

4 Q. OK. But this is the article you gave to the government in
5 support of your testimony. Right?

6 A. In partial support, yes.

7 Q. OK. Page 7 of 24, the top, the Alaggia study, 2010. This
8 one we have a -â€”- this involves male -- it says, well, 36

9 percent. We have a 42 percent disclosure rate identified here
10 during childhood. Do you see that?

11 A. Yes.

12 Q. And then 26 percent claimed repressed memory. Right?

13 A. That's what it says there, yes.

14 Q. I don't need to go through all of these. But fair to say
15 that it's an overstatement, based on the literature, to claim
16 that a majority of child alleged victims fail to report sex

17 abuse during childhood.

18 A. I would not agree with that, no.

19 Q. Can you point to one study that supports your conclusion
20 here, or your opinion here, that a majority fail to report --
21 A. A study you just cited, the Alaggia 2010, 46 disclosed --
22 42 disclosed, which would mean 58 percent did not.
23 Q. It says during childhood. We don't know exactly when the
24 disclosure occurred or didn't. You're talking about
25 substantial amounts in your government testimony here today,
