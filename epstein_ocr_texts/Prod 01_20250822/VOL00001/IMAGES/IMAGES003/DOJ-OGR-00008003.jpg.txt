1 Q. Yes. "The model should undergo rigorous testing to ensure
2 the stages accurately represent the complex process of sexual

3 grooming." Do you see that?

4 A. Ido.

5 Q. "Further, a standardized measure of grooming behaviors

6 should be developed based on behaviors and stages delineated in
7 the SGM," which is what they're talking about here. Right?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. So as we stand here today, there has been no further

10 rigorous testing of this model that you're aware of. Correct?
11 A. There is an enormous amount of testing and scientific study
12 that led up to this particular model. I'm not aware -- I

13 don't -- I can't speak as to whether or not they've done

14 research subsequent to this, no.

15 Q. But even these authors say that this isn't good enough for
16 evidence-based grooming testimony. Right?

17 A. That's not my reading of the paper, no.

18 Q. OK. And you don't â€”- have you ever asked these authors

19 about their opinion?
20 A. No, I have not.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: If we can turn to Exhibit 4, please.
22 Q. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. You've
23 talked about it. This is the Bennett and O'Donohue opinions,
24 or article, in which Bennett and O'Donohue say that there's a
25 lack of consensus regarding what grooming is and talk about it
