1 18. And so the fact that the defendant was taking these steps
2 towards a girl who was 17 years old certainly speaks to her

3 knowledge and willingness to provide such a girl to Epstein

4 with respect to the sex trafficking counts as well.

5 THE COURT: So to prove the sex trafficking count,

6 we're talking Count Five and Count Six, right?

7 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

8 THE COURT: On this one, for sex trafficking, you have
9 to prove what with respect to H in order to get a conviction?
10 MS. MOE: That the victims were less than 18 years

11 old.

12 I would note on that score, your Honor, with respect
13 to the trafficking counts, the issue is about commercial sex

14 acts in exchange for something of value involving individuals
15 under 18. Minor Victim-3 would testify about participating in
16 sexualized massages with Epstein at the defendant's urging and
17 receiving compensation in part. And that's one of the many

18 other reasons why her testimony is corroborative of other

19 victim testimony in this case and direct evidence of the
20 charged crimes.
21 THE COURT: So the conduct took place -- the sexual
22 conduct took place at the age of 17. Factually, this is an
23 individual who says -â€”- the government can't establish under the
24 age of 18 for purposes of travel. I guess that goes to the
25 Mann Act, not to the trafficking count.
