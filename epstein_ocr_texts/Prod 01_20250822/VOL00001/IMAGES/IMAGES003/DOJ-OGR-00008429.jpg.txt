and Shawn, and their prior convictions were only discussed briefly during their direct testimony—
and not at all on cross-examination. Including the instruction therefore would not serve its
intended purpose. Rather, it would have the opposite effect of overemphasizing the prior
convictions.

If the Court nevertheless gives this instruction, the Government requests that it be included

discusses particular circumstances of certain witnesses, namely, those testifying under
pseudonyms. Because the proposed instruction at most reflects brief testimony by only two
