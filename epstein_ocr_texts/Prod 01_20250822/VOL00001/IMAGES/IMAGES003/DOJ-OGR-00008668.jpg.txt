Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563_ Filed 12/18/21 Page 130 of 167

1 alleged to have taken place involving Ms. Maxwell or in her presence. You may consider this

2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.

3. Maxwell’s knowledge of the unlawful purposes of the conspiracy.

4 It is for you to determine whether the Government has established beyond a reasonable

5 doubt that such knowledge and intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important for you

6 to know that Ms. Maxwell’s participation in the conspiracy must be established by independent

7 evidence of her own acts or statements, as well as those of the other alleged co-conspirators, and

8 the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.

9 It is not necessary for the Government to show that Ms. Maxwell was fully informed as
10 to all the details of the conspiracy in order for you to infer knowledge on her part. To have
11 guilty knowledge, Ms. Maxwell need not have known the full extent of the conspiracy or all of
12 the activities of all of its participants. It is not even necessary for a defendant to know every
13. other member of the conspiracy.
14 In addition, the duration and extent of Ms. Maxwell’s participation has no bearing on the
15 issue of her guilt. She need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have
16 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that
17. was done before she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy’s existence while she
18 =wasamember. Each member of a conspiracy may perform separate and distinct acts and may
19 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the
20 membership of the conspiracy, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the conspiracy and
21 knowingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not matter whether Ms. Maxwell’s
22 role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time
23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.
