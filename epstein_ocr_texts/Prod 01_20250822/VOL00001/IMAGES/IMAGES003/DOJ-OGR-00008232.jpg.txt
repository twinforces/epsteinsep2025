The governments Ictter next addresses photos. of vibrators and_a stuffed tiger. As for the
vibrators, ‘the. government does not contend the vibrators are the “particular vibrators ‘uséd:on
Jane,” only that they are “they type” of vibrators used on Jane. Gov: Letter at: 10. But:there: is no
‘testimony to support that argument, because Jane did not describe the vibrators other than to:say.
they-were “different sizes.” TR. ‘11/20/2021, p 310:14-1 5. And because:the government did not
show these photos to Jane, there is no evidence that.they are “the type” she claims Mr. Epstein
uséd on her. If they were “the type,” Jane could, casily have said.so on’the stand.

The tiger next: Jane testified.that-Mr. Epstcin-had “animals” and “animal-hcads” and.
“strange things” in/the house, that were: “a, little ereepy personally.” /d.'at 3.1 8:5-13.. She did:not
testify'or describe a tiger. There’s no, foundation ‘to admit that photograph, or the photograph of a
stuffed dog, which, Jane also. did not describe. Gov. Letter at 11.7

The government. also discusses six’ photos that show the so-called structural features, of
the house. Again, Ms. Maxwell docs not challenge photos of the: outside of Mr. Epstcin’s:
apartment. But photos of the inside of the apartment are a different, matter. The government;has
not authenticated’them, and even if they were authenticated, they. have minimal if arly probative

value, as contrasted. with. their potential to :mislead.the.jury as to what the apartment. looked like

* Mr. Alessi’s testimony about back massagers in. Palm Beach has no bearing-on the
vibrators found in.New York twenty years later. See Gov. Letter-at.9.

* Stuffed animals and vibrators are also highly mobile:
