Re: US. v. Maxwell, 20-cr-330 (AJN), timely opposition. to. blanket requests to seal,

portions of motions in limine, trial exhibits, public access

Dear Judge. Nathan:

On behalf.of Inner City Press arid in my personal capacity, I have been covering
the above-captioned case. This conceéms in the first itistanee the flurry of motions
in. limine filed earlier this evening, replete with redactions justified. by' the a.
conclusory reference to Lugosch.v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d,

The Government's Justifications for redaction (Docket No. 399, docketed at: 10:06
pm on Friday Oct 29) cites Lugosch then'says "The Government-also seeks sealing
of trial exhibits, where are not public." Inner City Press immediately opposes this.

As one example within. this motions of limine, the Government has redacted the
entirely of its Argument X, even. the title and the page number. And as to. trial
exhibits, see forexample Judge Jed S. Rakoff's order.:in. US v. Weigand, 20-cr-188
(JSR) https:/www..documentcloud.org/documents/20536946-rakofforderonmrlicp

There, Judge Rakoff ordered the US Attoriey's Office to make trial exhibit
available to the public at large. While this was done, belatedly, .in.US v. Parnas, it
was refused in the current US v. Cole. It cannot be:refused. in this case.

Also, Inner City Press understands that the listen-only call-in telephone lines
available so far in the case, there may be an attempt to. discontinue them. The Court
should take judicial notice of continue COVID-19 issues, including people's
understandable concerns about congregating even in.so-called, overflow rooms. Be
aware that the District for the District of Columbia still allows public phone access
to all. criminal. proceedings, even those held in-person. That should happen here.
The loss of First. Amendment freedoms, even. for a short:period of time,
unquestionably constitutes irreparable imjury. //rod’y. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373
