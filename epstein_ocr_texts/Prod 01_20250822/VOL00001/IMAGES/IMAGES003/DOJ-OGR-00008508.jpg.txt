Overt act in-furtherance of the conspiracy. Further, the overt act'néed not. be oné that is alléged. in

the Indictment. Rather, it-can.be any overt act that is substantially similar to those acts alleged in

‘the Indictment, if*you,are convinced. that. the act occurred while the conspiracy‘was still, in

existence and that it was:done in, furtherance of the conspiracy as. described in. the Indictment. In
addition, you:need ‘not be unanimous as to’ which overt act. you, find to have been, committed. It
is ‘sufficient: as long as all of'you ‘find that at least one overt act: was committed. by one ofthe
conspirators.

in furthérancé of that conspiracy involved a‘witnéss other than Kate. Put simply: you may not
convict:the Defendant.on Counts One or Three solely on.the basis of Kate’s testimony or an

doubt, that it occurred. at: or about the time.and place stated.
