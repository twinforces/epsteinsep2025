Victims.and their lawyers would “benefit.” (/d.)

The defendant already has the information-relevant to this argument. She has the protocol.
for the EVCP. The Government has “offered” no “information” or “findings” to the EV€P about
‘the Minor Victims; to the extent the EVCP'relicd on publicly available information about this case
to: make its.determination, ‘such as the charging instruments: in this case, that information ‘is in the:

public record. And the Government has already disclosed. to the defendant the’ settlement.
