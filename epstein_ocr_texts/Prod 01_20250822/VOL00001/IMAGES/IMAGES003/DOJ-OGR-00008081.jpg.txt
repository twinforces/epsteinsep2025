Hunt and, Bull (20.12) revicwed signs that can be-used'to differentiate true allegations of:
sexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis
that cmotional. distress Was predictive. ofthe. truthfulness ofthe allegation. This is consistent’
across the: literature, and emotional distress (c.g., crying) is not. regarded as a rcliable: predictor of
the accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there
Is little empirical support-to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or erying while
reporting an ‘assault; indicates that-the report is, more likely to be truc. This ‘is likely due to the fact
that such reactions can.also occur in falsé allegations for various. reasons, including. a false
memory. or-an attempt to:mislead by those who know this sort/of reaction would be expected of a
true allegation. .

Individuals'who have been, sexually assaulted have higher‘rates, of‘ mental disorders than
individuals Who. have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher:rates. of
post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,, bipolar. disorder, drug-use disorders, and alcohol usc
disorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental ‘Disorders Associated with Sexual Assault: A,
Meta-Analysis, 21 Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2020), pp. 1011-1028. Any of these mental,
disorders that: occur more frequently among those who have been sexuallyassaulted can affect
memory, and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.

Varying degrecs of post- -traumatic stress symptomatology occur in. significant proportions
of victims following sexual assault and. last, for: varying durations, Emily R. Dworkin, Anna E.

Assault: A Meta- Analysis of Prospective Studics, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (202:1)

from their PTSD even after many‘years, and-variables associated with.a longer time to:remit
from an-cpisode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol, abuse anda. history: of childhood
trauma. Caron,.Zlotnick, Meredith Warshaw, ct al., Chronicity in’ Posttraumatic: Stress Disorder

Symptoms of PTSD. include distressing memories of the event; intense or prolonged
psychological distress at exposure to cues that symbolize or resemble an, aspect of the traumatic:

traumatic: event; avoidanec or cfforts to avoid. distressing. memorics, thoughts, or feclings about
‘or. closely associated, with the traumatic: event(s); and. avoidance of or efforts to avoid external
reminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects; situations) that arouse distressing

or fo unnecessarily recreate ‘a. scxual assault, event, any of which ‘would. be expected to clicit.
intense distress.
