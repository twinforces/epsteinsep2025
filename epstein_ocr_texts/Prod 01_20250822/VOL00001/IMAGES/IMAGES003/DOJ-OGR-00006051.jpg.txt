Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 407 Filed 11/03/21 Page3of7
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA

Judge Pauley granted a motion for a new trial as to Parse’s three co-defendants but held
that Parse had waived his right to an impartial jury because his attorneys had sat on background
research collected before and during trial that suggested Conrad’s voir dire answers were false.
Id. at 101. On appeal, the Second Circuit “had no difficulty with the ruling of the district court in
the present case that the jury empaneled to hear the case against these defendants was not an
impartial jury.” /d. at 111. Moreover, the Second Circuit reversed Judge Pauley’s ruling that
Parse had waived his right to an impartial jury, and vacated Parse’s conviction. /d. at 118.

The result in Parse was that a three-month trial, with 41 witnesses and some 1,300
exhibits, was undone by the falsehoods of one juror during voir dire—falsehoods that could have
been uncovered by thorough background research and prompt action by the parties. Numerous
bar associations have recognized that trial counsel is expected to conduct internet research on
potential jurors. Some bar associations have opined that professional standards of competence
and diligence may require such research. For example, just weeks after Judge Pauley conducted
a post-conviction evidentiary hearing in Parse, the New York City Bar Association stated the
following in Formal Opinion 2012-2:

Just as the internet and social media appear to facilitate juror misconduct, the same

tools have expanded an attorney’s ability to conduct research on potential and sitting

jurors, and clients now often expect that attorneys will conduct such research. Indeed,

standards of competence and diligence may require doing everything reasonably

possible to learn about the jurors who will sit in judgment on a case.

Similarly, in 2014, the American Bar Association recognized the “strong public interest
in identifying jurors who might be tainted by improper bias or prejudice,” and therefore opined
that it was proper for counsel to research “a juror’s or potential juror’s Internet presence, which
may include postings by the juror or potential juror in advance of and during a trial... .” See
