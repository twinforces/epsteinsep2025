Judge Pauley: granted a;motion fora new trial.as to Parse’s three co-defendants but.held.
that Parse had waived.his right to:an impartial jury‘becausc his.attorncys had. sat on background
research collected, before and during trial that-suggested. Conrad’s voir dire answers were false.
Id. at.101. On appeal, the Second, Circuit “had no difficulty with the ruling ofthe district court iin
the present case that the:jury empancled to hear'the case against these defendants was not-an.
‘impartial jury.” /d. at 111. Moreover, 'the Second Cireuit reversed .Judge: Pauley’s ruling that
Parse had waived. his:tight to an. impartial jury, and’vacated Patse’s conviction. /d. at 1:18.

The result in Parse was that a three-month trial, with 41 witnesses and some: 1,300
exhibits, ‘was'undone by. the falschoods, of once juror during voirdire=falschoods that: could have
been‘uncovered by thorough background research and prompt action by the partics. Numcrous:
bar associations have recognized that trial counsel is expected to conduct. internet research on
potential jurors. Some bar'associations have opined that professional standards of competence
and diligence may require:such research. For:cxample, just wecks after Judge Pauley conducted,
a‘post-conviction evidentiary hearing in.Parse, the New York City Bar Association stated the:
‘following in, Formal Opinion 2012-2:

Just.as the internet and. social. media.appcar to facilitate: juror:misconduct, the same
tools have expanded an attorncy’s ability to.conduct research on potential and sitting

jurors, and clients now often expect that attorneys will, conduct such research. Indeed,

standards of competence and diligence ‘may: require doing everything reasonably:

possible to learn, about the jurors ‘who will sit.in judgment on a case.

Similarly, in 2014, the American Bar Association recognized the “strong public interest
in. identifying jurors who ‘might be tainted. by improper bias or prejudice,” and therefore opined.
that it was proper for counscl to research “a juror’s or potential juror’s.Internet:presenee, which

may’ include’postings by the juror or*potential juror in advance of and. during.a'trial......” See
