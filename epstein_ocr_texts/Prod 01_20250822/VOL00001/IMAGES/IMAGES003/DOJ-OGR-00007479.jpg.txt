flaws allowed-him. to ‘use'his brilliance to manipulate ‘people to do his bidding and.

to compartmentalize ‘people: into, isolated cells in which none, had complete

information about.his activitics.

Ex. 1, p 7. This testimony is patently relevant to Ms.. Maxwell’s knowledge and intent and to'the
conspiracy: counts. If this ““compartmentalization” prevented Ms. Maxwell from having'the
required - knowledge or intent (an-ultimate issue forthe juryto decide, on which Dr. Dictz will

‘the :Court can give a limiting ‘instruction. That limiting instruction would be in addition to the
‘Court’s written instructions, which already will instruct.the jury not to decide the case: based ‘on
sympathy or bias. Malletier v. Dooney & Bourke, Inc., 525.F. Supp. 24.558, 571 (S.D.N.Y.
2007) (“This Court. has routinely rélicd/upon. limiting instructions'to remind the jury of its role:
