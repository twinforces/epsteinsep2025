I did.

A.

Q. Why did you provide the government with this article?

A. I was asked to provide examples to the government of
court to understand the concepts that I'm talking about. This
does a really nice job of pointing to the part that the terms
grooming and seduction refer to a pattern of behavior that.'s

widely known. and well established te be part of the dynamics of

sexual abuse. But in particular, I appreciated the author's
emphasis later on in the article of some of the problems with
the words seduction and some of the ways that much earlier
literature erroneously used terminology that could
inappropriately indicate a victim is blamed for the abuse that
they have been subjected to.

MS. POMERANTZ: Can. you. ‘pull up Page 31, please.
