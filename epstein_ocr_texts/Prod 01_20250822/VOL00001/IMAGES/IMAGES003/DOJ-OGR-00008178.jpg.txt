But the Court:would, preclude Dr. Dictz’s testimony. on hindsight bias'to the extent that it

instructs the jury to bé cognizant of hindsight bias in their own decision making. First,,
“Ch]indsight bias is a. common-sense: concept—everyone knows. that ‘hindsight is‘20/20.””
Adams vy. Lab’y Corp. of Am., 760 F:3d 1322, 1335 (1.1th,Cir. 2014). Because the expert?s
“opinion is-onc that the jury‘ could reach with their own ‘common knowledge. and ‘common
sense,” no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v. RCL: Hosp. Holdings, .nc., No. 16-CV-
2242 (VEC), 2020 WL 1503452, .at.*6(S.:D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2020) (quoting 4 Weinstcin’s Fedcral
Evidence § 702.03 (2019)). Indeed, neither the Government nor the Court could identify a
federal court that;has admitted, expert testimony on the jury’s hindsight bias. Gov’t Br. at.14.
The Defense cités io such casé law in.its response. Second, even if the jury’s hindsight bias
were a relevant topic of expert testimony, the Court would exclude it because of Rule 403

Maxwell’s intent. -An éxpert instruction on hindsight bias risks. confusing the jury and usurping
the Court’s role in,instructing the jury'as to the law:, Nimel,.414 F.3d at 397.

Next; Dr: Dietz offers an opinion on the so-called halo effect. Specifically, the Defense:
expects that.Dr. Dictz would.testify that an individual’s positive traits—like attractiveness,
charisma, intelligence, and status—can, cause other people to overlook: the individual’s negative
traits. Notice: at. 5-6. Dr. Dietz’ would testify that Jeffrey Epstein “exploited'the Halo cffect.to
surround himself with people who would. serve his needs” while “compartmentaliz[ing]” what
they‘knew about his activities. /d. at:6-7. The, Defense argues that the opinion. is relevant to'Ms.
Maxwell’s:kniowledge of Epstein’s conspiracy. Def. Br. at 9-10. The Government argues that
such testimony:is irrelevant'to any defense and that it improperly suggests sympathy and.

nullification. Gov’t. Br: at 15=16. It further argues that Dr. Dictz’s opinion on Epstein
