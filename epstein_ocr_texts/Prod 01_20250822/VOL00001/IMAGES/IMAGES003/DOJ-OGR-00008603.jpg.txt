testimony..and accept. it-with great care. This is not to suggest that any-witness who has an.
‘interest in the outcome of a case would.testify falscly. It 1s for you. to decide to what extent, if at
all, the witness’s interest-has affected or colored his or her testimony.

You have:heard the ‘testimony of 'a-witness who was previously convicted of a:crime;_

_punishable: by more than one year in jail. This prior conviction was:put into evidence for you. to

“consider in:evaluating the witness’ credibility. ‘You:may consider the fact:that: the witness who:

testificd.is a convicted. felon in deciding how.much:of his or her:testimony to‘accept:and what.

weight, if.any, it should be given.

You are not required to accept testimony: even, though the testimony is not.contradicted
and the witness’s testimony 1s not challenged. You may décide because of the witness’s bearing,
or demeanor, or because of the inherent improbability.of the testimony, or for other reasons
sufficient to yourselves that the testimony is not’worthy of. belicf, On the other hand, you, may
find, because. of.a witness’s, bearing and. demeanor and based upon your considcration of all the
other evidence in the case, that the witness is truthful,

Thus, there is ‘no, magic: formula by which you, can evaluate testimony: ‘You bring to this
courtroom all;your experience and. common sense.. You. determine for yourselves in many
circumstances the reliability of statements that. are made by others.to you ‘and-upon which you.
are asked to rely and.act. You may use. thé same tests here that’you use in. your everyday lives.
You-may consider the interest of any witness:in the outcome of this case and any bias or
prejudice of any ‘such witness, and this:is true regardless of who:called or questioned the witness.

Finally, as ‘you.know, I have permitted certain witnesses to be referred to in open court
cither by their firstname or a-pscudonym. As | explained to'you.in my’preliminary instructions

before opening statements, this ‘process, is to protect the privacy. of witnesses as this case has.
