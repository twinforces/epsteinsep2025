Victims];” (3) “[a]ny and all” material “submitted by each [Minor Victim]” to the EVCP; and (4)
“communications” between the EVCP and the Minor Victims or their counsel. (Def. Mot.
Attachment A). The subpoena should be quashed as to each of these categories.?

A. Payment Records

The first category—copies of payments made to the Minor Victims—concerns information
already in the defendant’s possession. Indeed, the defendant’s motion cites the amounts received
by the Minor Victims, which is reflected in their 3500 material (Def. Mot. at 3), and the
Government expects the Minor Victims to testify to those amounts at trial.

Accordingly, this information is “otherwise procurable.” United States v. Pena, No. 15 Cr.
551 (AJN), 2016 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 12, 2016). The subpoena should therefore
be quashed. At most, the Court should order production of that information to the Court so that it
may be provided to the defense in the unlikely event that the Minor Victims testify inconsistently
with their prior statements at trial.

B. Claim Release Forms

The defendant makes no argument for the relevance of the release forms executed by the
Minor Victims, and none is apparent to the Government. The Court should therefore quash the
subpoena insofar as it calls for that category of information, at least until the defendant explains
what relevant and admissible evidence is contained in the release forms.
3 The Government has standing to challenge the subpoena because it targets information about
anticipated Government witnesses, “based on the Government’s ‘interest in preventing any undue
lengthening of the trial, any undue harassment of the witness and [her] family, and any prejudicial
over-emphasis on the witness’s credibility.’” United States v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 561,571 (S.D.N.Y.
Nov. 25, 2020) (quoting United States v. Giampa, No. 92 Cr. 437 (PKL), 1992 WL 296440, at *1
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 1992)). The Government has provided notice of this subpoena to the Minor
Victims and is informed that at least two victims expect to file submissions regarding the subpoena.
