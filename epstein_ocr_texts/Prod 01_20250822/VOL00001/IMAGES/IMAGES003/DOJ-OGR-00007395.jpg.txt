Victims];” (3) “[a]ny‘and all” material “submitted by cach [Minor Victim]” to the EVCP; and (4)
“communications” between the EVCP' and. the Minor Victims or their counsel. (Def. Mot.
Attachment A). The-subpocna.should. be quashed as to cach. of these categorics.°

A. Payment:Records

The first:category—copies of payments made to the Minor Victims—concerns information
already in-the defendant’s possession. Indeed, the:defendant’s motion. cites the amounts. reccived.
by the Minor Victims, which is reflected, in their 3500 material (Def: Mot. at 3), and. the

Accordingly, this information.is “otherwise procurable.” United States'v, Pena, No. 15 Cr.
551 (AJN),.2016 WL 8735699, at.*2.(S:D:N.Y..Feb. 12, 2016). The subpocna should therefore
be quashed. At most, the Court should order production-of that information to the Court so:that it
may’ be provided, to the defense ‘in the unlikely event that the Minor Victims testify.inconsistently:
with their prior statements at'trial.

B. Claim Release Forms:

The defendant makes no argument for the ‘relevance of the release forms executed by the:
Minor Victims, and none. is apparent to‘the.Government. The Court should therefore quash the
subpoena insofar as it calls for that category:‘of information, at least: until the defendant explains

what relevant. and admissible cvidence is contained in the release forms.

>The Government: has standing to challenge the subpoena because it targets. information, about:
anticipated Government witnesses, “based,on the 'Government’s ‘interest:in preventing any ‘undue
lengthening of the trial, any*undue harassinient of the’witiiess and [her] family, and any prejudicial
over-emphasis onthe witness’s eredibility:’” United States-v. Ray, 337.F.R.D. 561, 571 (S.DIN.Y.

Nov: 25,2020) (quoting United States v., Giampa, No. 92 Cr. 437 (PKL), 1992’ WL 296440, at *1,
(S-D.N. LY. Oct..7, 1992)). The Government. has provided notice of this subpoena to the Minor

Victims and:is informed that.at.lcast two victims expect to file submissions regarding the subpoena.
