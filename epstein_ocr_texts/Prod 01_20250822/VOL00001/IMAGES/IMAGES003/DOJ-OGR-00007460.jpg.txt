Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 497 _ Filed 11/23/21 Page8of1i1
1 Rules of Conduct
2 Finally, let me caution you about certain rules and principles governing your
3. conduct as jurors in this case. First, you must not talk to each other about this case
4 or about anyone who has anything to do with it until the end of the case when you
5 go to the jury room to decide your verdict. The reason for this requirement is that
6 you must not reach any conclusion on the charges until all of the evidence is in.
7  AsThave said, keep an open mind until you start your deliberations at the end of
8 the case.
9 Second, do not communicate with anyone else about this case or about
10. anyone who has anything to do with it until the trial has ended and you have been
11. discharged as jurors. Anyone else includes members of your family and your
12 friends. And no communicating about the case means no communicating on your
13. cell phone, iPhone, Blackberry, text messaging, websites, internet chat rooms,
14 email, social media websites or applications (including Facebook, Instagram,
15 Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) â€” or by any other means. I know in this
16 day and age there is temptation to look to these devices or means of
17. communication, but with your oath you are making a commitment to resist that
18 temptation. You may tell your family and friends that you are a juror in a criminal
19 case, but you may not tell them anything else about it until you have been
20 discharged by me.
