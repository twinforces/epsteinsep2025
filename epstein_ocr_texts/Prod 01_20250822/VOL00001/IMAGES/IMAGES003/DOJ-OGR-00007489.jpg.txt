trauma on memory. The government does not explain how it can be fair to oppose the testimony
of an actual memory expert.

According to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is
proper under Fed. R. Evid. 702 because:

Sexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances,

often only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may

be lost. With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in

the context of fear and trauma cause people to narrow their focus to the most salient

and relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it

is very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although

the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where

the abuse occurred.

Taken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child

sexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in

a delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of

detail when the disclosure finally occurs.

The validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, however, is that these opinions
are a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government
desperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as
suggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,
psychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admitted that these things impact
memory during the 702 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p 121-22.

These are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”
expert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts
such as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have
been regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary
number of innocent people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on
faulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the
“memories” incorrect. Jurors do not understand these scientific concepts and will benefit from
