trauma ‘on memory., The government does ‘not explain how-it-can’be fair to oppose the testimony
of an.actual memory. expert.

According to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory::is
proper under Fed. ‘R. Evid. 702 because:

Sexual:abuse also impacts thic Wway:memory is cnéoded. In.traumatic circumstances,

often.only the most salient details. are encoded, and.over time, specific details may

be lost. With traumatic memory: in, particular, adrenaline: and. cortisol responses in,

the context of fearand,trauma-cause:people'to:narrow theirfocus to the:most salient:

and relevant details. If'someone is abused multiple times or by: multiple ‘people; it

is, very Common for memorics of similar-oceurrences. to jumble ‘together, although.

the victim can. remember. the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where.

the abuse occurred.

Taken together, Dr. Recchio’s, expert testimony’ explains ‘why’ ‘victims of child

sexual abusc—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose, their abuse in

a delayed and:ineremental fashion, and why their. memories may lack some level of:

detail when, the: disclosure: finally occurs.

The validity: of these opinions is debatable. What is, not, however, is that these opinions
are a small part of what-may or may not.affect somcone’s: memory overtime. The government
desperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory.such.as
suggestibility; substance abuse: (both short.and long term), secondary. gain, the effects of time,
psychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admitted that:these things impact
memory during the 702 hearing). 7:.¢.,. Ex: 2, p.121-22.

These are not topics. readily"understandable. The. government has sclécted a “trauma”
such as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have
been-regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the: extraordinary
number of innocent;people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based.on

“memories” incorrect. Jurors do not-understand these scientific ‘concepts and will’benefit: from
