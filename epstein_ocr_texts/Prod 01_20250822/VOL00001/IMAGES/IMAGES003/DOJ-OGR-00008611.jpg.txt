1 Instruction No. 51: Particular Investigative Techniques Not Required
2 You have heard reference, in the arguments of defense counsel in this case, to the fact
3 that certain investigative techniques were used or not used by the Government. There is no legal
4 requirement, however, that the Government prove its case through any particular means.
5 Your concern is to determine whether or not, on the evidence or lack of evidence, the
6  defendantâ€™s guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
