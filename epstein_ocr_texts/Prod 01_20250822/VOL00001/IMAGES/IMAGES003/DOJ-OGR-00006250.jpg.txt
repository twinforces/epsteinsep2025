adopting outright a legal conclusion proffered by an expert witness, the testimony would remain
objectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).

4. Factual Narratives About the Case

The following opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual narrative about the case:

e Identification of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as
described in Paragraph 6 above.

e How, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of
distorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.

Dr. Loftus should be precluded from embedding a factual narrative about the case in her
opinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus
does not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf Ex. A at 3 (“Attached
as Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.
Loftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have
influenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to show that she has “reliably
applied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 702. Any such
opinions from Dr. Loftus regarding the facts of this particular case would thus lack any scientific
basis, would be extremely prejudicial, and would mislead the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 702, 703,
403; see also, e.g., Island Intell. Prop., 2012 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts
to act as... vehicles for factual narrative... .”).

TW. IF DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO DR. ROCCHIO ARE ACCEPTED, THE

DEFENSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED

It bears noting that neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony can survive the
defense’s own understanding of the reliability requirements of Daubert. While the Government
