Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
October 29, 2021 (Dkt. No. 420) ordering the Government to respond to the defendant’s October
29, 2021 letter regarding delivery of the defendant’s legal mail at the Metropolitan Detention
Center (“MDC”) (Dkt. No. 381). The Government also writes in response to questions raised by
the defense at the November 1, 2021 conference about materials sent to the defendant last week.

The Government has conferred with legal counsel at the MDC, and was informed of the
following: Legal mail from a defendant’s counsel sent through the United States Postal Service
(“USPS”) has a different delivery process than that outlined in the Government’s October 15, 2021
letter as to electronic discovery provided by the Government (Dkt. No. 350). MDC’s Legal
Department is not involved in the delivery of legal mail sent by a defendant’s counsel. Instead,
MDC mail room staff must pick up such mail from the post office once every business day. The
mail room staff picks up the mail in the morning. After picking up the mail, the mail room staff
must log the mail. Once the mail is logged, the respective unit managers retrieve the mail from
the mail room and deliver the mail to the inmates. If, for example, mail is delivered to the post
