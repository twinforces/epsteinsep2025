Re: United. States'v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20'Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The partics respectfully submit. this letter regarding the logistics for public access for
closing arguments. The parties propose that they will release a'public: version of their slides (to
the extent, they do not contain scaled. materials) following the: conclusion. of the trial. day on the
same: basis that they have: been releasing public exhibits during trial. This proposal.appropriately
balances the public interest in, access to closing arguments with'the Court:and the parties” interests
in. avoiding delay and effective advocacy on behalf of their clients, as well as. ‘the, interests’ of

victims and third parties protected by the Court’s scaling orders."

Closing argument demonstratives are: not. part of the official. trial. record. The approach jointly

proposed by the partics is consistent with ‘trials conducted. without clectronics, where 'the public

would not. be in a’position to see white ‘boards or easel displays positioned facing the jury: box.
