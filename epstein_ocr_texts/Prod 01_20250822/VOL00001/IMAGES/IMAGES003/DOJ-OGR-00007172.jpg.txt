respond to those issués tomorrow. But ‘this i858 an issue -- and

I. will. give the government the benefit of the doubt --— they do

not know what 'we do whén we have a conference with Ms. Maxwell
so to assume what we are doing 1s. erroneous. But, I will
complete that topic and, move on to another one.

THE COURT: I want to understand the specific
suggestion.

So, presumably now, on a daily basis, the government
may be meeting with witnesses, and 'taking notes. I mean, I get
those notes, an additional 3900 material during trial, it is
one or two pages 6f chicken scratch, Handwriting. So your
proposal is that every day that one of those is produced it's
hand delivered to the MDG by governrienit staff?

MS. STERNHEIM: That. would, be ideal but. I'm not, asking
that and I don't think it Gomes that way, I think it. comés more
in, these clumps. I'm mot. asking for every single page to be
hand=délivered but if they kno6w they are making a substantial
production, that should, be hand-delivened.

THE GOURT: And what. do you mean by substantial? Over
a hundred pages? What are we talking about?

MS. STERNHEIM: Look: Y6u know, it is nét the
quantity, it is what is in, it that may have significance here.

THE COURT: Ms. Sterrnheim, ydéu have to be realistic on
this.

MS. STERNHEIM: I'm trying to be.
