1 respond to those issues tomorrow. But this is an issue -- and
2 I will give the government the benefit of the doubt -- they do
3 not know what we do when we have a conference with Ms. Maxwell
4 so to assume what we are doing is erroneous. But, I will

S complete that topic and move on to another one.

6 THE COURT: I want to understand the specific

7 suggestion.

8 So, presumably now, on a daily basis, the government

9 may be meeting with witnesses and taking notes. I mean, I get
10 those notes, an additional 3500 material during trial, it is

11 one or two pages of chicken scratch, handwriting. So your

12 proposal is that every day that one of those is produced it's
13 hand delivered to the MDC by government staff?

14 MS. STERNHEIM: That would be ideal but I'm not asking
15 that and I don't think it comes that way, I think it comes more
16 in these clumos. I'm not asking for every single page to be

17 hand-delivered but if they know they are making a substantial
18 production, that should be hand-delivered.

19 THE COURT: And what do you mean by substantial? Over
20 a hundred pages? What are we talking about?
21 MS. STERNHEIM: Look. You know, it is not the
22 quantity, it is what is in it that may have significance here.
23 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, you have to be realistic on
24 this.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: I'm trying to be.
