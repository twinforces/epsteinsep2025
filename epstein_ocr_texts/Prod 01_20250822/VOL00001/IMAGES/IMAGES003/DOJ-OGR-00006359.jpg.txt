Proceedings 246
1 alleged victims are being withheld from the public and the
2 | press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I have
3 | therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals
4 | by their first names only; however, those full names are Known
5 | to the Government, the defendant, and to the Court.
6 You may also have noticed that the witness was
7 | asking the Government whether she should say the last names of
8 | certain individuals. Going forward, the witnesses will
9 | receive a list of the individuals whose last names are to be
10 | protected to which they may refer while testifying.
11 Anything else you want me to put in there?
12 MS. PENZA: Not from the Government Your Honor.
13 THE COURT: You object?
14 MR. AGNIFILO: I do, Judge.
15 THE COURT: Your objection is noted.
16 Also, I'm going to direct that the parties shall not
17 | make any speaking objections. If the basis for an objection
18 | is not apparent, the parties may request a sidebar.
19 MR. AGNIFILO: Very good. Thank you, Judge.
20 THE COURT: Okay, what else?
21 MS. PENZA: Nothing else from the Government, but we
22 | would just ask for five minutes to make sure that the list is
23 | correct for the current witness.
24 THE COURT: All right, we'll take a five-minute
25 | break.
