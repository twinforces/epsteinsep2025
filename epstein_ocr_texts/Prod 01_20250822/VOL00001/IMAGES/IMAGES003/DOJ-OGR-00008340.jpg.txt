1 on the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein.

2 Correct?

3 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes.

4 THE COURT: My question is, I think if you add

5 "solely," this is what I hear: that the defendant can be

6 convicted based on this witness's testimony regarding the

7 sexual conduct between Mr. Epstein and this witness, and other
8 evidence regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and
9 Mr. Epstein. Is that a correct statement?

10 MR. ROHRBACH: I see your Honor's point. Yes, that
11 would be a correct statement.

12 THE COURT: That would be in, in--

13 MR. ROHRBACH: That would be incorrect.

14 THE COURT: That would be wrong. As a matter of law.
15 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes.

16 THE COURT: And that doesn't solely give it that

17 meaning, that potential meaning?

18 MR. ROHRBACH: I see your Honor's point that if

20 creates a -- it becomes amenable to that reading. The
al government's point is that â€”--
22 THE COURT: And should the jury be instructed that
23 way, that would be, in my mind, reversible error.
24 MR. ROHRBACH: That would be an incorrect statement of
25 law, yes, your Honor.
