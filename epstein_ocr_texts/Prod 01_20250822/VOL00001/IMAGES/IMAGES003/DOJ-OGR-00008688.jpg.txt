1 Instruction No. 48: Limiting Instruction — Similar Act Evidence
2 The Government has offered evidence which it argues shows that on different occasions,
3. Ms. Maxwell engaged in conduct similar to the charges in the Indictment. It is for you to decide
4 whether Ms. Maxwell engaged in the other conduct.
5 Let me remind you that Ms. Maxwell is on trial only for committing acts alleged in the
6 Indictment. Accordingly, you may not consider this evidence of similar acts as a substitute for
7 proof that Ms. Maxwell committed the crimes charged. Nor may you consider this evidence as
8 proof that Ms. Maxwell has a criminal personality or bad character. The evidence of the other,
9 similar acts was admitted for a much more limited purpose and you may consider it only for that
10 limited purpose.
1] If you determine that Ms. Maxwell committed the acts charged in the Indictment and the
12 — similar acts as well, then you may, but you need not draw an inference that in doing the acts
13. charged in the Indictment, that Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly and intentionally and not because
14 of some mistake, accident, or other innocent reasons. You may also consider this evidence in
15 determining whether Ms. Maxwell utilized a common scheme or plan in committing both the
16 crimes charged in the Indictment and the similar acts introduced by the Government.
17 Evidence of similar acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose.
18 Specifically, you may not consider it as evidence that Ms. Maxwell is of bad character or has the
19 propensity to commit crimes.
