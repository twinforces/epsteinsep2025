Pathways to False Allegations 101

The determination that a report of sexual assault is false can be

made only if the evidence establishes that no crime was committed or

attempted. This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-
tigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to
prove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would

be labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must

be supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2005,

pp. 12-13; emphasis in original)

“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-
tence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence
of evidence CIACP, 2005). Lisak et al (2005) compiled findings from studies
that addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and
methodology and placed a narrower estimate of the frequency of false rape
allegations between 2% and 10%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-
ically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat
rare. However, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-
not always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is
often the case that little or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-
stantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. However
uncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely
alleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-
tions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the
event that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case
proceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of
the etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports
the falsehood of a claim.

A brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may
help to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of
false allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences
for accused persons. In the following case, the alleged victim never recanted
her claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. However,
an understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim
as considered in the context of available evidence could have informed
the investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could
lead the accuser to file a false rape allegation. On March 13, 2006, the
lacrosse team at Duke University hired two exotic dancers, Crystal Magnum
and Kim Roberts, to perform at a house party (Hemmens, 2008). While
at the house, Magnum fell unconscious for a short while after which an
exchange of insults occurred between the lacrosse team and the two strip-
pers. Roberts then drove Magnum to a store where she was dropped off.
After being arrested for public drunkenness, Magnum accused three of the
Duke lacrosse teammates of rape. The allegations were pursued over the
