LBAAMAX3p's Rocchio - Direct,

particula® the pérson I was é6valuating talked abowtit how' he
thought that the person who eventually abused him was a really

good guy bécause there was another older ‘person involved in the

troop, and they were best friends. And. sq he really thought
this other guy was réally cool, and that was how he, you know,
came to kind of be introduced and involved in the relattonship.,
There's a -- ‘there was a -- in a Glinical setting,
I've certainly talked with individuals where, you know, I've
talked about that part of, why they came to trust someone and

initially started the melationship with them was because either

they lodkéd cool 6r they knew soméohe that they knew 6r they
were introduced by a friend, or a teacher. So in those settings
eértainly I'vé == it's something that. happens.

HE COURT: Does it surprise you, then, there's no
discussion in the literature 6f that specific pheénonienon?

THE WITNESS: I think, that it's -- no, because J, ‘think
what I'm talking about is. spécific ways in which individuals

are Kind of disarmed om come to trust others, so within the

literdturé thé phenomenon of what. kinds of things, like == can
create an aura of trust and, respectability, that is certainly
discussed in the literature. But I think that the example

you're asking me about is so highly specific, I think it would

fall under the category of a number of things that are

discussed, but. I'm not aware of it Having been. discussed that,

specifically.
