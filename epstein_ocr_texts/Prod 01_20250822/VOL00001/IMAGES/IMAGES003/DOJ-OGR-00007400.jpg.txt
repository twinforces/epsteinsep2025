7 Inthe event the Court does not quash the subpoena, the Government notes that it is returnable to
the Court’ for in. caniéra review. (Def. Mot. at 1). To. the éxtent' the Court. releases any ‘records
from the EVCP to'the defendant, it should.only release those records that comply with. the Nixon
standard. See Skelos, 2018 WL 2254538, at *2 (“To:avoid delay in trial, courts sometimes require

documents, in. camera and. then disclosing any admissible documents only’ after the witness
testifies.”). For instance, if ‘the, Court identifies a ‘prior inconsistent statement in only one
document,no other:records should be released to the defendant. And, in addition. to evaluating:
whether. any: statement is.relevant'to show bias or as a prior inconsistentstatement, the Courtshould.
consider whether it ‘is precluded: under Rule 403, for the reasons described. above. See supra. pp.
