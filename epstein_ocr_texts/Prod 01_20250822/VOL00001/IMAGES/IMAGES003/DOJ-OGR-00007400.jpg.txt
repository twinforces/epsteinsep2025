7 Tn the event the Court does not quash the subpoena, the Government notes that it is returnable to
the Court for in camera review. (Def. Mot. at 1). To the extent the Court releases any records
from the EVCP to the defendant, it should only release those records that comply with the Nixon
standard. See Skelos, 2018 WL 2254538, at *2 (“To avoid delay in trial, courts sometimes require
production of impeaching material to the court (but not to counsel), with the court reviewing these
documents in camera and then disclosing any admissible documents only after the witness
testifies.”). For instance, if the Court identifies a prior inconsistent statement in only one
document, no other records should be released to the defendant. And, in addition to evaluating
whether any statement is relevant to show bias or as a prior inconsistent statement, the Court should
consider whether it is precluded under Rule 403, for the reasons described above. See supra pp.
