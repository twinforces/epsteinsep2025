1 considerations.

2 Taking all of that into account, I'll describe now how
3 we will proceed.

4 As I've indicated, we will do a screening

a questionnaire before jury selection. That questionnaire will

6 prescreen for what I see as the major for-cause strike issues

7 in the case. So, for example, the trial's length and schedule,
8 a juror's personal knowledge of the parties, extent of a

9 juror's awareness of publicity about the case and the

10 defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a result of the
11 nature of the charges. This sort of questionnaire is, of

12 course, very common in high-profile cases. I transmitted my

13 draft questionnaire to counsel yesterday, and we'll discuss it
14 shortly.

15 As they typically do, the clerk's office will randomly
16 assign juror numbers and create a corresponding list of names
17 and juror numbers for the prospective jurors. That list will
18 go to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.
19 On the questionnaire itself, jurors will be identified only by
20 their assigned juror number. We will refer to the jurors in
21 court throughout the process by their juror numbers only.
22 The jury department will administer the questionnaire
23 in morning and afternoon panels on November 4th, 5th and 12th.
24 The procedure between questionnaires and voir dire will be as
25 follows:
