1 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes. The government believes that its
2 notice, in combination with its 3500 materials and the cases
3 it's pointed the defense to, should give the defense an
4 understanding of Mr. Flatley's opinions, to the extent that
5 they're expert opinions at all and not just fact opinions.
6 THE COURT: Well -â€”-
7 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, my point is that
8 Ms. Menninger says that she would have her expert review
9 Mr. Flatley's testimony in other cases to see if there are
10 opinions he disagreed with, and I just wanted to clarify that
11 the defense expert should review the material the government
12 has provided them.
13 THE COURT: That's fine, but it's your notice that
14 sets up the opinions that your expert is offering.
15 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor.
16 THE COURT: So what they should do is look at the
17 notice, and if their expert has different views than what's in
18 the notice, they should provide those views.
19 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: If your notice is insufficient under Rule
21 16 to tell us now what opinions your expert is going to
22 provide, then you may have problems down the road. But I'm not
23 going to have them held to a different standard than what the
24 government has done here.
25 MR. ROHRBACH: Of course, your Honor.
