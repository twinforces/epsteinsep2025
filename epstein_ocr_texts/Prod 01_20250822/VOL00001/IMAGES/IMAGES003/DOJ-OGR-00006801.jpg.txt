on the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to
the abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming
with different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily
distinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature
reviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors
were used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature
reviewed discussed male offenders.
Identifying Potential Victims
Elliott and colleagues (1995) interviewed 91 child sex offenders about the
strategies they used when committing their offenses. They found that 33%
of the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s
home and 18% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other
children and then gave bribes to the recruits.

Conte, Wolf, and Smith (1989) interviewed 26 offenders about their
crimes. They found that offenders often admitted to being able to iden-
tify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”
and seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to
“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything
you say. I would approach them by being friendly, letting them think I was
someone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., 1989, p. 298).

In her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,
Shakeshaft (2004) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the
compliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers
usually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft
also identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,
such as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-
pation in other risky behavior. However, it also must be remembered that
nonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children
and want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and
needs cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.

The Use of Attention, Bribery, and Coercion

Elliott and colleagues (1995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample
offered to play games, teach a sport, or teach how to play a musical instru-
ment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove
the child home. Thirty percent admitted to using affection and love to gain
the child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in
exchange for sexual favors.

The offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (1989) also claimed
they used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For
example, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,
