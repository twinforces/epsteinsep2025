would. not have to stretch for cases about Brady disclosures from other circuits. See Bowen, 799
F.2d at '613 (referring simply to a “common trial. tactic: of defense lawyers”).

This case exemplifics the point. The defense would like’to (inaccurately) argue that. the
New York: investigation ‘was, opened in response to the non-prosccution, agreement entered,
between, the USAO-SDFL and. Epstein, (the “NPA”), that ‘the. Govermment “scramble[d]” to
investigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and. that “public: pressure” Jed to a sloppy
investigation. (Def.'Opp. at 34). To do, this, the defense would like'to, clicit information about the
process by:which.the Government opened the. New York investigation, media-coverage, statements
by the former. Attorney General, Epstcin’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).
Présumably, underits view, the defense could ‘introduce other categoriés of evidence that. relate in
any way to the thoroughness or good. faith of the: investigation. .None:of. that. has anything, to do
with the defendant’s guilt or innocence.

With respect to Rule 403, it.is not’ chough for the defense to say that jurors ean/understand
that there were two separate investigations., (See id.,at 35). The defense, as: the proponent of this
alleged evidence, has the burden to cstablish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.
They:cannot.do so. It:is the defense’s plan'to introduce information-aboutthe:internal case opening’
and charging decisions of the USAO-SDFL and, this Office, a summary of media, coverage, and a.

host of other irrelevant topics.'? The circus this would, create at trial vastly outweighs any

from Florida are being called as limited. fact; witnesses. The Government. does ‘not expect to clicit.
the NPA. except perhaps to, draw the sting if the Court permits cross-examination 6n-the subject.
