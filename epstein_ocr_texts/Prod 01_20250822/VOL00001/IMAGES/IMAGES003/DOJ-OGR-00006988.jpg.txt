1 that, the defense gets ten peremptories; the government gets

2 six. As I said, I'll seat six alternates. Under the rule,

3 that's three additional peremptories per side for the

4 alternates. If my math is right, that adds up to 40.

5 To have a cushion heading into peremptory challenges,
6 it's my plan -- again, time dependent -- to try to gualify at

8 question is do we have that panel of qualified jurors come back
9 on the 19th and exercise peremptories, or do we have them come
10 back on the 29th?
11 Either way, I anticipate that once we have that panel
12 of qualified jurors come back, I'd ask some very basic
13 preliminary questions -- do any jurors wish to amend answers?
14 Confirm that they've not read or researched about the case,
15 we'd deal with any issues along those lines, and then the
16 parties would exercise the peremptories and all the others
17 would be excused.
18 If we do that on the 19th and finish the process, I'd
19 inform the 18 that they've been selected as jurors, remind them
20 very clearly of all the instructions and restrictions that
al apply, and direct them to return on the morning of the 29th.
22 On that date, I'd swear them in, give them standard
23 preliminary instructions, and we head to openings, straight
24 into opening statements.
25 Alternatively, if we were to wait for that final
