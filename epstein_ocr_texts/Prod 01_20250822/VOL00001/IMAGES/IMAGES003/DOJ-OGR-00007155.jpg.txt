Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document465- Filed 11/15/21 Page 104 of 127 104
LB15max4

1 officer testifying as to what the officer himself found and

2 participated in while executing a search seems to me

3 permissible fact testimony.

4 Anything to take up here from the defense,

S Ms. Menninger?

6 MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. Thank you.

7 THE COURT: Ms. Moe?

8 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.

9 THE COURT: Defense 11 is anticipated testimony

10 regarding an alleged rape by Jeffrey Epstein. Let me ask the
11 government to explain what it intends to do with respect to
12 this and for what purpose the testimony would be sought to be
13 introduced.

14 MS. MOE: Certainly, your Honor.

15 As a threshold matter, your Honor, I would note that
16 there is an overlap here between the arguments in the

17 defendant's motion in limine and the 412 motion. I think one
18 motion seeks to introduce some of this evidence but

19 characterize it as consensual and the other motion seeks to
20 preclude it, reference it to be non-consensual. And so, I
21 would be happy to address that now, but it may be easier to
22 address that issue in the context of the 412 briefing.
23 THE COURT: Counsel, do you agree?
24 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we can wait until the 412
25 briefing.
