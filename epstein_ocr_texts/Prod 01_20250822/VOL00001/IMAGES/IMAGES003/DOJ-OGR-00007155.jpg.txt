MS. MOE: Certainly, ‘your Honor.

As a threshold matter, your Honor, IT would note that.

there is an overlap here between the arguments in ‘the

défendant.'s métion in fiminé and the 412 tmotaén. I think one
motion, seeks to introduce some of this evidence but

Characterize it aS consensual and the other métion sééks to

preclude it, reference it. to be non-consensual. And so, I
would be Kappy to address. that now, but it may be easier tod
address that, issue din the context of the 412 briefing.

THE GOURT: Gounsel, do you agree?

MR. EVERDELL# Your Honor, we can wait until the 412
