1 MR. PAGLIUCA: That's fine, your Honor.
2 THE COURT: Respond in the same timeframe.
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Understood.
4 THE COURT: Defendant's 8 is the search, the El Brillo
5 Way search. The defendant seeks to prohibit the introduction
6 of any items seized during an October 2000 search of Jeffrey
7 Epstein's Palm Beach residence.
8 The defense raises concerns, including how and where
9 the evidence was maintained, the lack of authenticating
10 witnesses and the lack of relevance to the charges against
11 Ms. Maxwell. Here, again, the government states that it
12 intends to call witnesses to establish the authenticity of the
13 evidence.
14 So how do we take this up now, Ms. Moe?
15 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. The government submits
16 that at trial law enforcement witnesses will discuss the search
17 and lay a foundation for the admission of this evidence.
18 THE COURT: So as to authentication, you have
19 witnesses that did exactly what with respect to the search?
20 MS. MOE: They were personally involved in the search.
21 THE COURT: Okay. So they will describe the process
22 by which they engaged in the search and the evidence that they
23 obtained and how it was maintained and the like.
24 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: And the relevance of the search result
