OTHER INSTRUCTIONS
Instruction No. 39: Conscious Avoidance
move onto. my ‘remaining instructions, I want to now instruct you on the concept of conscious
avoidance..
As I have explained, each of the ‘counts charged in the Indictment requires the
Government to prove thatthe Defendant. acted knowingly, as have already defined that term.

If.a'person. is actually aware of'a:fact, then she knows that fact. But, in determining

‘whether the: Defendant acted knowingly, you may also consider whether. the Defendant

deliberately closed her eyes ‘to what otherwise would/have been obvious.

To be clear, the necessary knowledge on-the. part of the Defendant’with respect 'to any’

particular charge cannot'be established by showing that the Defendant was careless, negligent, or.

foolish. However, one may. not, willfully: and ‘intentionally‘remain, ignorant of a fact. material, and,
“conscious avoidance” or, “willful blindness.”

An.argument by the Government of conscious avoidance :is not. a ‘substitute. for‘proof: itis
simply another factor that you, the jury, may consider in deciding what the Defendant-knew.

Thus, if you find beyond 'a‘reasonable doubt that:the Defendant was. aware that there was.a high.

‘probability’ a crime was being committéd, but that the Defendant’ déliberately: arid consciously

avoided confirming this fact, such.as by purposely closing her eyes to it or intentionally:failing to.
investigate it, then you may’ treat this deliberate avoidance. of ‘positive knowledge as, the

equivalent of knowledge, unless. you find that the.Defendant actually believed that she was not

engaged in,such,unlawful behavior. In other-words, a defendant-cannot.avoid criminal
