1 THE COURT: What do you propose?

2 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think at a minimum we propose
3 some additional follow-up guess for the juror about her role,
4 whether she interfaces with folks dealing with compliance,

iy which is within the scope of what this witness does, whether

6 there would be any issues about hearing testimony about the

7 financial institution where she works.

8 We have not flagged for our witness that there is a

9 juror, of course, who works with the institution, so it's hard
10 for us to gauge whether they may have overlapped or whether

11 they would recognize one another in the courtroom. So I

12 recognize it would be difficult to probe this issue without

13 creating an issue, but we think at a minimum a question about
14 sort of her role and any issues about being fair or discomfort
15 about witnesses who are testifying from the financial

16 institution might address this issue.

17 THE COURT: Who will I hear from?

18 MS. STERNHEIM: You'll hear from me, Judge.

19 I think it is a little late. The publicly available
20 information would have revealed that there are other people who
21 are in that same institution or have been affiliated with that
22 institution, some of which were excused, and at least one that
23 is still here. The government can exercise a challenge if it
24 wishes. But I think it's unnecessary. And it flags something
25 inappropriately at this stage of the game. It will highlight
