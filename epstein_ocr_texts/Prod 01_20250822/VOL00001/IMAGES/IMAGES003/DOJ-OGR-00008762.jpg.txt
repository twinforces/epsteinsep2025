ignorant of facts which would confirm, to her that she was. engaged in,unlawful conduct.
‘With:respect. to the conspiracy counts, you‘must also.keep, in-mind that there is an
important. difference between knowingly and intentionally participating in.a conspiracy, on the
one hand—and which I just explained to: you—and. knowing the specific objective of the
conspiracy, on. the other. You :may considér conscious avoidance in. deciding whether-the,

Defendant knew the objective of a conspiracy, that is, whether she reasonably believed:that-there:

‘was a high probability that a goal, of the conspiracy was to. commit:the crime charged as objects:

of the. conspiracy and took: deliberate and conscious action to. avoid confirming that fact. but

‘participated in the conspiracy anyway. But conscious avoidance cannot be used. as a substitute

for finding that the Defendant knowingly and intentionally joined the conspiracy in the first

place. It-is logically impossible for.a defendant:to intend and agree to join.a conspiracy if she:

does not ‘actually. know it exists.

In sum, if-you ‘find that'the Defendant. believed there was a high-probability-that.a fact

‘was so and thatthe Defendant took deliberate and conscious action.to avoid learning the truth.of
‘that. fact, you may‘find that the Defendant acted.knowingly with.respect:to that fact. However, if

‘you find that the Defendant actually believed the fact was not so, then you may not firid that:she

acted knowingly with,respect-to that fact.
