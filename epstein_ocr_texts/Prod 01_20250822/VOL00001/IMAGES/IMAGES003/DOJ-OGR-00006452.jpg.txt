Finally, admissibility of the number and type of prior consistent statements still is guided
by Rules 401 and 403, including whether the prior consistent statements are reliable, cumulative,
or unfairly prejudicial; the Court may choose to exclude prior consistent statements when the
quantity and type of prior consistent statements form the bulk of the government's case rather
than the trial testimony of the witnesses. Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 165 (1995) (“If
the Rule were to permit the introduction of prior statements as substantive evidence to rebut
every implicit charge that a witness’ in-court testimony results from recent fabrication or
improper influence or motive, the whole emphasis of the trial could shift to the out-of-court
statements, not the in-court ones."); Wright & Miller, supra, § 6754 ("The danger of substantive
use of the prior statement remains on the unfair prejudice side of the ledger."). "One thing the
courts all agree on is that there is 'no rule admitting a// prior consistent statements simply to
bolster the credibility of a witness." /d. (emphasis supplied).

As to introduction of these prior consistent statements through other witnesses, the
Second Circuit is clear that "where the declarant has already testified and the prior consistent
statement is proffered through the testimony of another witness, the Rule's ‘subject to cross-
examination’ requirement is satisfied if the opposing party is not denied the opportunity to recall
the declarant to the stand for cross-examination concerning the statement." United States v.
Caracappa, 614 F.3d 30, 39 (2d Cir. 2010). Thus, if the government elicits prior consistent
statements from third-party witnesses, then they will be obliged to make the declarant-Accuser
available for recall to be subjected to cross examination concerning those statements.

In sum, the Court's rulings regarding admissibility of prior consistent statements can only
come at the time the government proffers them, explains the purpose for which they are offered
(whether under subpart (1) or (11) of Rule 801(d)(1)(B)) and clears the other evidentiary hurdles
