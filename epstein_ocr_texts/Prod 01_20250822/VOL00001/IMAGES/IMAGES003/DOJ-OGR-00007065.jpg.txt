1 any alleged victims' prior consistent statements. As I can

2 tell from the cross papers here, I don't think there's an issue
3 to resolve now. The government's reply notes it's not seeking
4 to admit any particular prior consistent statements at this

Â© time.

6 Ms. Moe, let me confirm there will be no mention of

7 any such statements in the government's openings, is that

8 correct?

9 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Okay. Of course, the admissibility of any
11 prior consistent statement hinges on defense counsel's

12 arguments and the purpose for which any statements are being

13 offered.

14 I think the parties agree on the applicable law here.
15 If this does become an issue, as they have outlined in their

16 papers, Rule 801(d) (1) (B) (1) excludes from the rule against

17 hearsay a witness's prior consistent statement offered to rebut
18 the charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or

19 motive. Of course, the prior consistent statement, should the
20 government seek to have any admitted, must have been made
21 before the motive to fabricate that's alleged arose, or else it
22 has no relevance in rebutting the fabrication charge. Tome v.
23 U.S., 513 U.S. 150, (1995).
24 The rule's second subsection excludes prior consistent
25 statements from the rule against hearsay when they're offered
