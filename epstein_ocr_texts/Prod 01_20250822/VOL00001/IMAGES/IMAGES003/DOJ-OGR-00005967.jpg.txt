Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document398 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page12 of 52

Il. GOVERNMENT CONCEDEDLY FAILED TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE
BASIS:OR REASONING: TO ADMIT ANY 404(B) EVIDENCE.

The government concedes that (i) it'was aware ‘of the December:2020 Amendments to:
Rule-404(b) (Resp. at:34), (ii) those Amendments required it to give notice of the: “permitted
purpose. for which:the prosecutor intends to offer the [404(b)] evidence andthe reasoning that
supports the purpose" (7d) ("Notice"), and, (iii) the October 11" "Maxwell Rule 404 Letter"
("Letter"). did:riot identify the “permitted purpose" under Rule 404(b) for’which the government
secks (altcrnative) admission ‘of the two categories of evidence, nor. the "reasoning, that. supports
that evidence." The government.wholly fails'to explain why it could not comply with these
“relatively modest" new Notice requirements on the'timcline ordered by this. Court. Nowhere in
response: does the government seek leave for an extension,to provide:the appropriate Notice out:
of time nor justify its “good cause" for failure to timely: comply with both the Court's Order ‘and.
the Rule. Instead, they-assert that “any-alleged. gap:in the Government's notice ‘is remediated by.
this bricf." Resp: at.39-40. To quote the government's response to Ms. Maxwell's motion. in
liming, "to. the extent the [goverriment] takes issue with the rule" requiring specific pre-trial
Notice under Rule:404(b), "that. complaint:is properly directed.to the drafters. of the Federal
Rules of Evidence:" Resp. at 61 n.15.

Having failed:to. comply*with the Notice requirements, of the, Rule by the (extended)
Court ordered. deadline of October (1,1, the government belatedly argues that the tendered.
evidence Is, cither direct evidence or admissible under Rule 404(b).. They are wrong on, both

fronts..

! Under'the misleading and.disingenuous sub-heading (2) ("The Government has Met and
Excéeded its’ Notice Obligations"), the goveminient!points only'to its (1) October 1:1. disclosure of certain
of the evidence (which gives neither'a a proper "purpose” or" reasoning”), and (ii) its Response (the

required "notice’is remediated ‘by this brief").
