II. Discussion

A. Authenticity

As a general matter, “an item of evidence must ‘be authenticated through introduction of
evidence sufficient to warrant a finding that the item is what the proponent says it is.”” United
States v. Corley, 679 F. App’x 1, 4 (2d Cir. 2017) (summary order) (quoting Crawford v. Tribeca
Lending Corp., 815 F.3d 121, 126 (2d Cir. 2016)). “Under Rule 901 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence, ‘[t]he requirement of authentication . . . as a condition precedent to admissibility is
satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent
claims.’” United States v. Jackson, 345 F.3d 59, 65 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 901(a)).

This bar for authentication “is ‘not particularly high.’” United States v. Bout, 651 F. App’x
62, 63-64 (2d Cir. 2016) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 506 F.3d 140, 151
