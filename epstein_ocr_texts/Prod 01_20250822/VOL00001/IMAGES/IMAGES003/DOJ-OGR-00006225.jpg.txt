Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 _ Filed 11/08/21 Page 14 of 41

That opinion is only one of those noticed. by the defense, however. The defense’ expert.
notice includes four other scts of opinions that supposedly respond. to Dr. Rocchio but:do not:
satisfy the Daubert standard. First, the expert notice—which. closely parallels. the defense’s
Danhert motion—improperly discusses the ‘facts of this particular case and comments on, various
légal documents, cventhough.it. offers no. basis. whatsoever to conclude that Dr. Dictz has any legal
‘expertise or has,reliably: applicd any expertise to the facts of this case. In ‘particular, the notice
states that Dr. Dietz will opine that Dr: Rocchio’s opinion on grooming “carrics the risk: of
‘imputing motive and.intent to the Defendant” (Ex. A.at 3), that.“Dr. Rocchio’s proposed.testimony:
is silent. as to whetherishe is:;expected to impute a theory of ‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,”
and that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticitig sexualized, massages ‘for herself?”
but instead that. she: “recruited and groomed minors to provide scxualized massages for Mr.
Epstein” (id..at-4). These opinions, while potentially relevant to'the ‘Court’s. consideration of. a.
Daibert motion, are not properly put-before a jury.

Second, certain, of Dr. Dictz’s opinions about grooming are not themselves reliable or
invade the province of the jury: In particular; it is circular'to say'that:““grooming” “imputes, motive
and. intent.” because: grooming is..defined.'to be a strategic pattern of behavior used to develop
relationships of attachment and coercion between perpetrators and.victims. (Ex. A,at 3). That is,
if, the behaviors lack ‘the réquisite: motive and intent, they are not grooming behaviors. If Dr.
Dictz’s. point is. that determining motive and. intent is. for the factfinder (d:), the Government.
agrecs—and Dr. Dictz should not.be:permitted.to testify that grooming behaviors “impute[] motive:
and intent without adequate. evidence.” (/d.) The adequacy of the evidenee is a question ‘for the

jury. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will.inform the juryabout'the existence ‘of grooming bchaviors, but
