ee If Dr. Hall had some admissible substantive
testimony, the Government would not object to a foundational account of how he evaluated Minor
Victim-4. The defendant has not, however, identified any admissible substantive testimony from
Dr. Hall.

This Court has discretion, after careful consideration of alternatives, to exclude Dr. Hall’s
testimony based solely on the inadequacy of the defendant’s disclosures and the lateness of any
supplemental disclosures. See Ulbricht, 858 F. 3d at 116-17 (affirming district court’s exclusion
of two defense experts on those grounds).
