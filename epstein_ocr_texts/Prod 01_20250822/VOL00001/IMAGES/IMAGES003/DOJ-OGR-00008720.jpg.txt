and your common sense. Reasonable doubt is not-whim or speculation. It is not an excuse to

avoid an;unpleasant. duty: Nor is it ‘sympathy for the Defendant. The law in a;criminal case 1s,

that it is sufficient ifthe guilt of the Defendant is established beyond a reasonable doubt, not

‘beyond. all possible doubt. Therefore, if, after a fair and impartial consideration. of all the

such.a doubt as would reasonably. cause a prudent person to hesitate in. acting :1n matters. of
importance:in his. or.her. own affairs—then you have a-reasonable: doubt, and in that circumstance:

it is your duty to-acquit:Ms. Maxwell of that charge.
