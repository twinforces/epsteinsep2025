Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 2 of 93
INTRODUCTORY INSTRUCTIONS
Role of the Court
You have now heard all of the evidence in the case, as well as the final arguments of the
lawyers for the parties. My duty at this point is to instruct you as to the law. It is your duty to
accept these instructions of law and apply them to the facts as you determine them.
On these legal matters, you must take the law as I give it to you. Regardless of any
opinion that you may have as to what the law may be—or ought to be—it would violate your
sworn duty to base a verdict upon any other view of the law than that which I give you. If an
attorney or anyone else at trial has stated a legal principle different from any that I state to you in
my instructions, it is my instructions that you must follow.
You should not single out any instruction alone stating the law, but you should consider
my instructions as a whole when you retire to deliberate in the jury room. You may take a copy
of these instructions with you into the jury room.
Adapted trom the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United
States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 533 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro,
17 Cr. 151 (AJN).
