B. Other Photographs

Many of the remaining photographs of Epstcin’s, house corroborate. other ‘testimony: by’
Jane. As withthe nude pictures: in the massage:room,, cach. of these: photographs is:consistent with.
testimony: about Epstcin’s practices, so they are’ probative corroboration of that testimony.

First, Jatic testified that. Epstein uséd vibrators and. back massagers of sizes while abusing:

Second, Jane testified thatthe home contained “creepy looking: animals.” (11/30/21 Tr. at

>The Government could. not elicit testimony from Jane about these photographs without.

Jane onthe stand, the Government. would. surely need. to show her the photographs in. advance.
Doing so would permit an inference that Jane tailored her testimony: about -her:memorics: of the
massage :room to the photographs, thereby vitiating, the: photographs’ valuc as. :independent
corroboration, .
