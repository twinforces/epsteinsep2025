Id, at;331,. The government’s attempt'to authenticate Exhibit 52 through:Ms. Maxwell’s
testimony‘about Somethiiig clse. cntirely’fails.

The flaws.in the government’s argument don’t end-with these two problems, though cach
problem itsclf is dispositive of the government’s request. The government’s Ictter focuses
exclusively on the authentication question. The government does not address the business records
exception or cven'attempt to justify the: admission of Exhibit 52 despite it- being hearsay.

The govertiment also conveniently ignores all it said, before about’ why Exhibit 52'was
relevant and-how it. would be admitted and-used.as ‘evidence. The government first said. Exhibit:
52 was Ms., Maxwell‘s book. That was:the entire’premise ofthe government’s, November 12
letter and its, opposition:to. Ms. Maxwell’s motion. in limine. But no ‘witness has testified-that'it
was ‘Ms. Maxwell’s' book, and the government has abandoned that argument."

The government; next said it:would call Employec-1 as a'witness to authenticate the
exhibit and. lay the foundation for its admission and, in-turn, to testify that Exhibit 52 belonged to
Ms. Maxwell has been saying all along: Exhibit ‘52: did:not belong'to her, and Employec-1 was
never going to testify that it did.

late. stage in, its casé, having now abandoned its carlicr arguments for admissibility aid-relevarice.

As this Court recognized carlicr today, Mr. Alessi, is done testifying, and Ms. Maxwell cannot:be

' We know the government has abandoned .this argument because it-rclics on-Ms.
Maxwell’s deposition testimony. as the basis for admitting Exhibit, 52. But in that testimony, Ms.
Maxwell unequivocally denicd being the owner, of or:responsible for Deposition Exhibit. 13.
