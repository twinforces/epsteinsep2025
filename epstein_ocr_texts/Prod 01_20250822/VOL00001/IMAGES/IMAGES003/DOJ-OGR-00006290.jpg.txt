because the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions
from filing the allegation.

Studies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID
are most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Brown, Stein, &
Turk, 1995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-
mon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where
peer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often
the focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be
challenging in this population as it may be unclear whether individuals have
sufficient knowledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent
(Jjoyce, 2003). For instance, in some sexual assault cases, individuals with
ID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the
assault. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this population
would be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase
their potential for coercion and. exploitation.

Intellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without
ID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the
legal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with
moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating
about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other
communication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).
Ahgrim-Delzell and Dudleyâ€™s (2001) findings indicate that communications
skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims with mild
ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to
file sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties
with memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals
with ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2003) who have been shown to have poorer
memory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to
fill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, 1993).
However, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;
rather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely
to provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the
event (Ternes & Yuille, 2008). In other words, individuals with ID are less
likely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Hatton, 1999).

Specific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer
memory, may account for inaccurate reporting of events (Gudjonsson &
Joyce, 2011). Individuals with ID have been shown to be significantly more
suggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2003; Everington &
Fulero, 1999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,
1993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability
among individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency
toward accepting information communicated by others and incorporating
this information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-
disposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is
presented (Chronbach, 1946). Thus, investigative procedures that involve
