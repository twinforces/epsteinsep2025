] Instruction No. 56: Redaction Of Evidentiary Items

2 We have, among the exhibits received in evidence, some documents that are redacted.
3 “Redacted” means that part of the document has been taken out. Material may be redacted for any
4 number of reasons, including that it is not relevant to the issues you must decide in this case, among
5 other reasons. You are to concern yourself only with the part of the item that has been admitted
6 into evidence, and you should not consider any possible reason for the redactions.
