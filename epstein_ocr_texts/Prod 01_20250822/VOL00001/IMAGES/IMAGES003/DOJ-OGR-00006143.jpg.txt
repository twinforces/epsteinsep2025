Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 77 of 93
Expert Testimony
[Tf applicable]
You have heard testimony from a witness/certain witnesses who was/were proffered as
(an) expert(s) in different areas. An expert is allowed to express his or her opinion on those
matters about which he or she has special knowledge and training. Expert testimony is presented
to you on the theory that someone who is experienced in the field can assist you in understanding
the evidence or in reaching an independent decision on the facts.
In weighing an expert’s testimony, you may consider the expert’s qualifications,
opinions, reasons for testifying, as well as all of the other considerations that ordinarily apply
when you are deciding whether or not to believe a witness’s testimony. You may give the expert
testimony whatever weight, if any, you find it deserves in light of all the evidence in this case.
You should not, however, accept a witness’s testimony merely because he or she is an
expert. Nor should you substitute it for your own reason, judgment, and common sense. The
determination of the facts in this case rests solely with you.
