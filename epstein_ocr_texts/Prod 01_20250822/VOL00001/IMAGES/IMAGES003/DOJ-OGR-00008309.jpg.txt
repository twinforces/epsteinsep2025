Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document535 Filed .12/09/21 Page7of8

330-311 (S.D!N.Y. 2005). Similarly, in United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d.95 (2d Cir. 1980),
the Second Circuit affirmed admission of a hotel guest card, for'the:ion-hcarsay purpose that! a
person.claiming to have:the name of.a coconspirator registered at the hotel. ‘The:Government
then. admitted “other evidence ..... fron’ which the jury could infer'that the hotel, card spoke, the
truth.” Jd. at101. Last, in Vin Yat Chin, the Sccond. Circuit. concluded:that credit card receipts,
were admissible because:they “tended to show that a person,referring to himself as [the
defendant] signed reccipts on the dates, and times in question.” 37.1. F.3d at 39. ‘Other courts
have'taken.a similar approach to the Second Circuit. See e.g., United States -v. Chavez, 229 F.3d
946, 953-54 (10th Cir. 2000) (scrap of paper containing a phone number admissible “for the non-
hearsay purpose of linking the co-conspirators,” but.“*the number could-not have been. submitted
for. the truth. of the:matter asserted”); United States'v.. Munguia, 273 F..App’x 517, 521 (6th Cir.
2008) (affirming admission, of “‘ccll-phone contact: lists .. . forthe non-hearsay purpose of
linking, [the. defendant] to his :co-conspirators”); Wnited States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, 148 F.3d.577,
591, (6th Cir. 1.998) (“The government offered the numbers and addresses to demonstrate, in
conjunction with other:cvidence, that. members of the conspiracy’ associated with cach, other for
business purposes: . . . These documents.are not offered to prove the information they: contained
and, therefore, may not be excluded as hearsay.”’).

Here; the jury could, conclude based.on the testimony of Mr. Alessi.and GX 606 that,Ms.
Maxwell regularly used this. telephone: directory, versions of which were maintained ‘over the
years at the Palm, Beach residence. See Trial Tr. at'849; GX 606 at 7, 10. The directory is'thus.
relevant for the non-hearsay purpose that it tends to show a link between Ms. Maxwell and the
names:and phone numbers listed, as’well as how the information was organized. It.is not offered

‘to establish that any’ of the information. contained ‘within the book, such as'the listed phone.
