1 prior vulnerabilities with respect to childhood sexual abuse?

2 A. Ido.

3 Q. Can you explain.

4 A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm
a asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the

6 impact of an alleged event, say childhood sexual abuse, and the
7 degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to
8 that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account,

9 because part of what I'm looking at is, how can I determine

10 which of these persons' current difficulties are related to the
11 sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have

12 happened in their past. So we know, because of the

13 vulnerability literature, that if somebody is being abused in
14 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to

15 have a history of earlier childhood sexual abuse.

16 So I have to look at the interaction of those prior

17 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities
18 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the

19 grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also
20 ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted
2l with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the
22 individual I'm evaluating.
23 Q. How does what you have observed in your forensic practice
24 compare to your clinical practice with respect to individuals
25 in higher-risk groups?
