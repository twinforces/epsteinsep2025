LBAAMAX3p's Rocchio - Direct,

prior ‘vulnerabilities, with respect to childhood séxval abtise?
A. I do,

Q. Carn you explain.

A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm
asked, as part. of my forensic evaluation, 'to opine about the

impact. of an alleged event, say childhood sexual abuse, and the

degree to which a person's Current diffictlties are related to
that event, J have to take prior vulnerability into account,
because part of what I'm looking at is, how can I determine

which of these persons! current difficulties ane related to the

sexual abusé or maybe related to 6ther things that have
happened in their past. Sq we know, because of the
vulnerability literature, that if somebody is. being abuséd in
adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to
have a4 history of earlier childho6d sexual abuse.

So I have to Look, at. the interaction of those prior
vulherabilitiés and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities
beth may have made the ,individual more vulnerable to the

grooming behavior and to the subsequent séxudl abuse, and als6

with the abusé to Greate more adverse outéomes for the

individual I'm evaluating.

Q. How does what you have observed. in. your. forensic practice
compare to your clinical practice with respect to individual's.
in. higher-risk. groups?
