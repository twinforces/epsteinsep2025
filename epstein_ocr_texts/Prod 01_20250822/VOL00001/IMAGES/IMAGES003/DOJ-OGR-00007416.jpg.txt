Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document491 Filed 11/22/21 Page5of6.

(“During the mecting, the defendant produced a small bound book and scveral sheets of legal. pad

paper containing hand-written notes.”). Again, the book, is sewn. and bound, like the other copies
sech by Employee-1, and.is not. amenable to casy. insertion of pages. These “altcrations” do: net.
undermine the authenticity: of the book: in the slightest, but at. most, they go to weight and not
admissibility. See Zan Yat Chin, 371 F.3d.at 38; ef: Gagliardi, 506 F.3d 140, 151 (“Based-on the[]
testimony [that clectronic communications were accurate], a reasonable juror could have: found.
that the exhibits did represent those: conversations, notwithstanding that the e-mails and_online:
chats:were editable,”).

The defense is correct that Employéc-1. cannot say that she. saw ‘the. specific address book,
that is Government Exhibit 52. while she worked for‘Epstein. But: she can recognize: Government
Exhibit 52 as one of the many copies of the defendant’s, address book that; she did sce, and:she can
testify:to the practice:that, close in time to-;when Government Exhibit 52 left Epstcin’s house, the
address book -was regularly. kept in specific places around, Epstcin’s house. That testimony is
cnough to, satisfy the low bar for authentication, and. it:is supported. by Government Exhibit 606

and. by testimony that corroborates private information. inside the address book.
