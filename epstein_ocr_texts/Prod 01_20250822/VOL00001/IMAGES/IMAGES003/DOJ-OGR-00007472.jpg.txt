Fed. R. Evid. 702.

As elaborated below, the:proposed testimony of Dr. Dictz and-Dr. Loftus fall squarely
within the ambit. of Rule, 702.

I. Dr. Dietz’s. Testimony is Admissible.

The government agrees that Dr. Dictz is qualificd to offer expert opinion testimonyunder
Rule 702. Even. so, the government, hopes to limit, his testimony by claiming that six categories of
his proposed. opinions are either unreliable, irrelevant, or invade the province of the jury.

The ‘government, though, is trying to have:it both.ways, by cliciting testimony’ from its
expert Dr. Rocchio while unfairly precluding Ms. Maxwell from responding. The government
also, seeks to ‘foreclose, Dr. Dictz from offering opinions that are independently relevant to this
‘case, irrespective of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. To:make its case, the government engages in, the
‘time-honored ‘practice of mischaracterizing a defendant’s:position and then responding'to the
strawman.

This Court should reject the government’s efforts, which, ifsuccessful, will deprive Ms.
Maxwell of her.constitutional right to present a complete defense arid to confront,and cross-

examine her accusers. U.S.:'Const. amends. V, VI.
