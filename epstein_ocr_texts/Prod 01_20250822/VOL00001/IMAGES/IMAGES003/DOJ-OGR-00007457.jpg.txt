4 What Is and Isn’t Evidence
5 What, then, is evidence? Evidence consists only of the testimony of
6 witnesses, documents and other things admitted as evidence, or stipulations agreed
7 toby the parties. Some of you probably have heard the terms “circumstantial
8 evidence” and “direct evidence.” Do not be concerned with these terms. You are
9 to consider all the evidence given in this trial.
10 Certain things are not evidence and must not be considered by you. The
11 following is a list of what is not evidence:
12 First, arguments, statements, and questions by the lawyers are not evidence.
13. Nor are statements I make or questions I ask of a witness.
14 Second, objections to questions are not evidence. The lawyers have an
15 obligation to make an objection when they believe evidence being offered is
16 improper under the rules of evidence. You should not be influenced by the
17 objection or by my rulings on them. If the objection is sustained, ignore the
18 question and any answer that may have been given. If it is overruled, treat the
19 answer like any other. If you are instructed that some item of evidence is received
20 fora limited purpose only, you must follow that instruction.
