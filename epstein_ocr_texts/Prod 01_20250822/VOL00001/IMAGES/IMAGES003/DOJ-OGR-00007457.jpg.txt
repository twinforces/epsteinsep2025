witnesses, documents and other things admitted as evidence, or stipulations agreed
to by the parties. Some of you probably have heard the terms “circumstantial
evidence” and “direct evidence.” Do not/be concerned with these terms. You are
to consider all the evidence given. in this trial.

following:is.a list of what. is not, evidence:

First, arguments, statements, and questions by the lawyers are not evidence.
Nor.are statements I make or questions [ ask. of a witness.

Second, objections to questions are not eviderice. The lawyers have an
obligation to.make an objection when they believe evidence being offered is
improper under the rules.of evidence. You should not be influenced by the
objection or by my rulings on them. If the objection is sustained, ignore the
question. and any answer that may have been given. If it:is, overruled, treat the
answer like any other. If you are instructed that some item, of evidence is received

for a limited purpose only, you must ‘follow that instruction.
