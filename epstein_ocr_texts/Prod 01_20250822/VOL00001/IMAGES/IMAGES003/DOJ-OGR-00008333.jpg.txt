1 and the extraction of metadata as his expert testimony,

2 Mr. Flatley's views on those questions should be available

3 through the 3500 material and through his other expert

4 testimony, so there's really no need for any sort of further

5 identification by the government of anything before Mr. Kelso

6 should be able to let us know his views on those questions.

7 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the 3500 material doesn't
8 say Mr. Flatley is going to describe the extraction of user

9 data this way. He's talked about the fact that he has observed
10 the user data, but he hasn't talked about the methods that he's
11 used it. It's not that type of 3500 material from the

12 government. So I don't agree that we could tell from what they
13 have provided thus far exactly what Mr. Flatley's testimony is
14 going to be.

15 And frankly, they said Mr. Flatley was largely a fact
16 witness as well. So if I'm understanding now that they're

17 intending to offer something along the lines Mr. Kelso is, they
18 didn't provide sufficient notice for Mr. Flatley's expertise in
19 that area either.
20 THE COURT: Well, I have to go back and look at the
21 notice. But are you using Flatley as an expert?
22 MR. ROHRBACH: We think Mr. Flatley is primarily a
23 fact witness, but the line between a fact witness in a setting
24 like this and someone testifying on the basis of their
25 expertise is not well settled, and so we've given expert notice
