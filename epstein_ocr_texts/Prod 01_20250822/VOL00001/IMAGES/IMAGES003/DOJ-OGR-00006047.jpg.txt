Fifth, should. the Court limit or.cxclude Dr. Roccio’s opinions, rebuttal. opinions will
most likely’be unnecessary.

Sixth, the testimony oftwo-of the identified:experts, Gerald LaPorte and Jennifer Naso,
is anticipatory. These forensic document examiners have not yet'scen the document that
may or may not be produced. at: trial. They’ ‘were endorsed. out of a, spirit of non=
gamesmanship and in an.abundance of caution. Similarly, Robert Kelso will primarily: be
testifying regarding exhibits that the government recently disclosed. and, while’ likely not,
even an expert opinion, he too was disclosed, in an.abundarice. of caution.

Seventh, the government’s proposed schedule is unworkable.and will impact selection.
litigated beforejury selection.is that the court may Want'to inquire of the: prospective jurors
about “grooming” and, absent a. decision, won’t know if that. term is going to be used at
trial. If Dr. Rocchio’s, grooming opinions are disallowed, the issues regarding’ Rule 412.
will likely be narrowed.

Lighth, the defense :necds to know ‘in advance of trial, including opening ‘statements,
who is or is not testifying. It would be :préjudicial. to delay ariy challenge ‘from the
government, which may.or may:not come, until after November 23, to be resolved per the
government, after opening statements. This is the epitome, of gamcsmanship because ‘Ms.
Maxwell will then, riot be allowed to discuss the testimony'in opening.

And, finally, the problem here ‘was:ereated by the government. Had the government
disclosed the 3500. materials sooner, an earlicr expert disclosure date would. have been
scheduled, resolving the government’s alleged compressed. timing problem. It is the:

government;that‘has driven this schedule, not Ms. Maxwell.?
