Sexual grooming of children 297

Towards a new definition of sexual grooming of children

The definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the

complexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous

discussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems

necessary to provide a new definition that attempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual

grooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the following:

A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for

the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the

child’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process
serves to strengthen the offender’s abusive pattern, as it may be used as a means of
justifying or denying their actions.
Conclusion
Despite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood
clearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators
highlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales
has introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 regarding “meeting a child
following sexual grooming” (see Part 1: section 152003). A greater understanding of the
meaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this
legislation (for review see Craven, Brown & Gilchrist, in press).

Regardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological
theories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be
because prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than 10 years ago, at a
time when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that
theories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2001, 2002; Ward & Hudson,
2001; Ward & Siegert, 2002) has begun the process of theory knitting and development.
While Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still
focuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often
create their own opportunities to offend.

The current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the
literature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the
child. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes
details about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s
compliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.

A fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to
offender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may
indicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they
themselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving
beyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually
motivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and
treatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse
rather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knowledge and
understanding, it is necessary to consider how these findings are disseminated to the relevant
groups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.
