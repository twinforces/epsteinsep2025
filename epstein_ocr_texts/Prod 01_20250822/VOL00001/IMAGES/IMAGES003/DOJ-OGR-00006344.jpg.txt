Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 435 Filed 11/11/21 Page3of11
Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 262. The Defense cites only one case, United States v. Lewis, which
involved the distinct situation where a district court excluded expert testimony because the notice
itself was untimely. 818 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir. 2020). The Court concludes that the
Government’s supplemental materials in further response to the Defense’s motion are timely and
may be considered in resolving the Daubert motion.

Turning to the proffered expert opinions, as articulated in the Government’s disclosure
and at the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio would offer five expert opinions. First, that perpetrators
of sexual abuse of minors frequently use manipulation or coercion short of physical force as part
of a strategic pattern, often referred to as grooming, to make the minor vulnerable to abuse.
Second, that manipulation and grooming can prevent the minor from understanding their
experience as abuse and so prevent disclosure. Third, that abuse can cause long-term traumatic
and psychological consequences. Fourth, that the presence of another individual can facilitate
sexual abuse of minors. And fifth, that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are
common among victims of sexual abuse and that memory can be affected by a variety of factors,
including the effects of trauma.

The Defense does not contest that Dr. Rocchio has the qualifications to express opinions
on these subjects. Dr. Rocchio has a PhD in clinical psychology and is a clinical instructor at the
Alpert Medical School of Brown University. She has more than two decades of experience
treating hundreds of victims of trauma, many of which were minor victims of sexual abuse. She
has published peer-reviewed articles on trauma and sexual abuse and has given numerous talks in
addition to her teaching. Given these papers, and her credible and extensive hearing testimony,
the Court therefore finds Dr. Rocchio qualified as an expert.
