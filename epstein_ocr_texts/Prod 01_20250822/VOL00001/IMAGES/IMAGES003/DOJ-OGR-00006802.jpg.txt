talking, giving special attention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with
me. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).

In his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2010)
found that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their
students special attention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the power of
such rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards
from a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and
cognitions” (p. 376).

Budin and Johnson (1989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods
they used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they
did to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admitted to acting
like the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included
giving money, toys, candy, cigarettes, beer, or drugs to the child.

In his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2000) looked at
a sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or
“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw
children into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”
(p. 810) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%
of perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the
child), 22% gave the child extra attention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%
provided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games
or toys.

In their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (1990) found
that many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion
prior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers
made excuses to spend time alone with them; 61% indicated that they were
told that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the
abuser; 61% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted
as a child toward them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special
privileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%
indicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with
them; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or
doing activities that other children do; and 30% reported that their abuser
treated them “meaner” than other children.

Shakeshaft (2004) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually
“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement
on a project or taking on an outing) that not only allows for time alone with
the victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be
grateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts
do not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-
ilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot
lead to much disciplinary action.

Christiansen and Blake (1990) discussed that in father-daughter incest,
most fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters
