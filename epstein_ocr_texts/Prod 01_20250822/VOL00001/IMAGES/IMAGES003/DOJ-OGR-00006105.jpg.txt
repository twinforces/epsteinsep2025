Interstate commerce simply means the movement of goods, services, money and ———— = ==
individuals between any two or more states.
I instruct you that acts and transactions that cross state lines, or which affect the flow of

affecting interstate commerce. For instance, it affects interstate commerce to use products that
traveled in interstate commerce.

specifically knew or intended that her conduct would affect interstate commerce; it is only
necessary that the natural consequences of such conduct would affect interstate commerce in
some way, even if minor.
