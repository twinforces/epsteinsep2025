1 here is length of trial and the timing of trial. I would like
2 the parties, in Light of -- you have gotten some rulings,

3 obviously not everything yet -- to think about whether what we
4 include in the questionnaire is still the six-week time frame
iy that we have indicated. And if it is, it is, but if there is
6 any basis to suggest a lower estimate as the parties have

7 continued preparing their cases and in light of any rulings, I
8 would certainly be open to hearing it if we could safely put a
9 shorter time frame in the questionnaire. Again, maybe we

10 can't. So I just ask you to think about it and confer and put
11 in a letter by November 2nd, on ECF, indicating whether the

12 parties agree that there should be any different estimate to
13 the trial length than what we have indicated in the current

14 draft of the questionnaire. I recognize that may change after
15 that but for jury selection purposes it won't help us if a few
16 days later we decide that we could say four weeks instead of
17 six weeks. So you will let me know and I will ask the parties
18 to confer. You don't need to put in specific reasons, just if
19 you can put in a joint submission as to the parties' best
20 overall estimate of length of trial is to see if it can be
21 realistically any shorter than what is in the questionnaire to
22 help facilitate jury selection.
23 That's what I have. I will hear from counsel any
24 other issues. Ms. Moe?
25 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor; very briefly on two
