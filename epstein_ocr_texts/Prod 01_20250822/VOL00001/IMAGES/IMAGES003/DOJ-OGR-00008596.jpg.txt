responsibility for her own conduct. by “deliberately:closing her eyes,” orremaining purposefully

ignorant of facts which would. confirm to her that she was engaged. in unlawful conduct.

With respect to'the conspiracy counts, you must.also keep in mind that there .is an.

important difference between knowingly and intentionally participating in a conspiracy, on the

one, hand—and which.1 just éxplained'to you—and knowing the specific objective of the

conspiracy, on the other. You. may: consider conscious avoidance in deciding whether the

Defendant; knew: the objective of a conspiracy, thatiis, whether she reasonably. believed that there

was.a high. probability that.a goal of'the conspiracy'was to commit the crime charged as objects

‘of the conspiracy and took deliberate and, conscious action, to avoid confirming that fact but.

participated 'in'the conspiracy anyway. But conscious avoidance cannot be used.as a. substitute

for. finding that-the: Defendant knowingly and intentionally joined, the conspiracy .:in the first

place. It is logically impossible for'a, defendant to intend and ‘agree to join a:conspiracy if she

does not actually know it'cxists.

In.sum, if-you. find that the Defendant believed:there:was a high probability: that a fact

was_'so and that the Defendant. took: deliberate. and conscious action to avoid learning the truth of

that fact, -you-may find that:the: Defendant acted knowingly with respect to that fact. However, if

acted knowingly with respect to that, fact.
