Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563 Filed 12/18/21 Page 141 of 167

Instruction No. 42: Direét and Circumstantial. Evidéncé

‘use in reaching ‘your verdict. One type of evidence 1s direct:evidence.. One kind of direct

evidence:is a witness’s testimony about something:that:the: witness knows. by virtue of his or her
own senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct.evidence
may also bé inthe form. of an. exhibit!

The other type of evidence is circumstantial. evidence.. Circumstantial evidence is
evidence that tends to'prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is.a. simple example of
circuinstantial, evidencé that :is often-used in this courthouse.

Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was'shining and it

‘was a nice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windows that are drawn and that

you. cannot look:outside. As you are sitting: here, someone walks in. with.an umbrella:that: is

dripping wet. Someone else’ then walks in with a ‘raincoat that is also dripping wet.
Now, you, cannot look’ outside the courtroom and you. carinot see whether of not itis
raining. So. you’have no direct:evidence of that fact. But ‘on the combination of the facts that

have asked you to ‘assume, it would be reasonable and logical. for you'to conclude that between.

‘the. timeyou arrived at the courthouse arid the time these péople walked in, it had started to raii..

That. is all there is to'circumstantial evidence. You-infer based.on reason, experience, and.
common'sense from an established fact. the existence. or’the nonexistence of some other fact.
Many facts, such.as a:person’s state .of mind, can.only rarely be:proved. by direct

evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than:direct evidence. It-is‘a,general rule

‘that'the law:makes no distinction. between direct and. circumstantial evidence, but.simply requires.

‘reasonable: doubt: from. all the: evidence in. the case.
