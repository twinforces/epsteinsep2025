1 appropriate Daubert motion, identify responsive experts if

2 necessary. And so the government asks that the Court preclude
3 the defense experts at this time unless they give at least more
4 specific notice about what they might testify to.

S THE COURT: Well, they are precluded without more

6 specific notice. That's true.

7 MR. ROHRBACH: OK. Then that's fine for the

8 government, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Yes. I mean, plainly, Rule 16 hasn't been
10 met at this stage, and the representation is, they're not

11 anticipating anything coming up. If something comes up, they
12 would have to first provide sufficient notice in order for us
13 to be able to resolve this. So it can't being is that could

14 have been anticipated at this point. OK?

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes. Totally understood, your Honor.
16 THE COURT: OK. Thank you.

17 All right. Next thing on my checklist, the limiting
18 instructions related to witness 3 that I proposed. Who's

19 taking this one?
20 MR. ROHRBACH: I am, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: So Mr. Rohrbach, you propose -â€”- so I
22 suggested, "However, you may not convict the defendant on the
23 basis of the testimony regarding the sexual conduct between
24 this witness and Mr. Epstein." You agree that's a correct
25 statement of the law, yes?
