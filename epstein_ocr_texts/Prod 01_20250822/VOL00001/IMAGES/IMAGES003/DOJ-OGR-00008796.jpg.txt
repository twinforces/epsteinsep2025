Proposed Jury Instruction
For the reasons set forth above, we request that the Court give the jury the following
additional instruction tomorrow:
As to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the Government
has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with the intent that
Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York in violation of
New York Penal Law 130.55.
As to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the
Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported
Jane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of
New York in violation of New York Penal Law 130.55.
An intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York
cannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.
Sincerely,
/s/ Christian Everdell
