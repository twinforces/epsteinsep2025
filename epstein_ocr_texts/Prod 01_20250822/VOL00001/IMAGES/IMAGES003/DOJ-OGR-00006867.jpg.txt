Disclosure Patterns in Child Sexual Abuse 165
other family issues addressed in the aftermath of disclosure and where peers
play an important role.
Studies have confirmed the importance of professionals asking children and
young people in a sensitive, open manner about possible experiences of abuse
using non-leading questioning styles to minimise inaccurate accounts or
contaminate children’s narratives. It is clearly important for professionals to
remain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally
important for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning
those children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged
with children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both
initial and further disclosures.

Staller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2005) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.
1426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and
reactions that may encourage the child to disclose.
The importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an
opportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in
daily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear
that many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education | ‘Education and

of Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner
strategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,
not talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from
peers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service
providers), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the
bridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).
The tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures
are not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In
addition, the knowledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if
only a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with
this system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure’ rate found
in Goodman-Brown ef al.’s (2003) legal sample compared to Kogan’s
(2004) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed
disclosers in the legal system. Are children who delay in disclosing less likely | ‘Are children who
