they were in this case will depend on the other evidence. That is not a prejudicial simplification—
that is the trial.

There is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion
and attachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the
relevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand
witness testimony. That is all Rule 702’s gatekeeping requirements demand.

2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness

of Their Abuse is Admissible

At trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about how victims
process their abuse and how that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in
its expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:

The relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from

being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent

disclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as

victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the

consequences of that abuse until adulthood.
(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 1 at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the
relationship between attachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop
relationships of trust and attachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.
This opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not recognize that they are
experiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and
therefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in
life. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions
about coercion and attachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at 12). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.
