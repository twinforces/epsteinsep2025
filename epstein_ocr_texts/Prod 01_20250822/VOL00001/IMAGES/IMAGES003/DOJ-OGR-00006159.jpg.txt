must reflect your conscientious belief as to how the issues should be decided.

Thus, the verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror. In order to
return a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree to it. Your verdict must be unanimous.

If at any time you are divided, do not report how the vote stands, and if you have
reached a verdict, do not report what it is until you are asked in open court.

A verdict form has been prepared for your convenience. After you have reached your
decision, your foreperson will fill in the form. At that point the foreperson should advise the
marshal outside your door that you are ready to return to the courtroom.

Finally, I say this not because I think it is necessary, but because it is the custom in this
courthouse to say this: You should treat each other with courtesy and respect during your
deliberations.

In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that if you listen to the views of your
fellow jurors, and if you apply your own common sense, you will deliberate fairly.
