3. Minor Victim-4

Regarding Minor Victim-4, the defense motion largely focuses on disparaging her
credibility. (See Def. Opp. at 12-15). Without relitigating the issue here (see Gov’t Opp. to Def.
Supp. Mots. at 21, Dkt. No. 295 (“[T]he Government notes that the defense motion overstates the
significance of the particular statements Minor Victim-4 made during the USAO-SDFL’s
investigation.”), that issue is entirely orthogonal to her privacy interests at stake in her testimony.
