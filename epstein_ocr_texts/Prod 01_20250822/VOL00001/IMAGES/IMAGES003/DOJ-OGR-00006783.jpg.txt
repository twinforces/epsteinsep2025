'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was written by both Detective Recarey
and another witness who is expected to testify at trial. The exhibit is primarily marked for

by that other witness. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(5). The Government will not offer statements from
Detective Recarey.
