Re:  United.States’v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr.330(AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government, respectfully :secks redactions to its. letter motion for admission of
Government Exhibit.52 (Dkt. No. 533), sealing of Exhibit A to that letter, and-redactions to Exhibit.
B to that letter. The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent. with the ‘three-part. test.
articulated by the Sccond ‘Circuit:in Lugosch. v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 11.0 (2d ‘Cir.
2006). Although the Government’s letter and exhibits are. judicial documents subject'to. the
‘common, law: presumption, of access, the limited proposed redactions and.'scaling are: narrowly:
tailored. to protect the:privacy interests of the Minor Victims and. witnesses, including individuals
who are subjects of the Court”s pseudonym order, as well as third partics. The Government also

notes thatthe redactions to Exhibit B conform to:redactions of that:document in:Giuffrev. Maxwell,

15 Civ. 7433, (LAP).
