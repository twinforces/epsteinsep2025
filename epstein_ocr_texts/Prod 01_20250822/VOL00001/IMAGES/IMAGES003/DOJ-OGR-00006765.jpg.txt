Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a defendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 801).
Accordingly, the Government argued that “the defense will receive notice of any co-conspirator
statements that the Government may seek to introduce through witness statements” in its Jencks
Act production. (Gov’t Opp. at 192, Dkt. No. 204).

The Court denied the motion, explaining that the Court lacked the power to order pretrial
disclosure of non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements. (Op. & Order at 30, Dkt. No. 207). The
