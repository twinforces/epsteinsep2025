1 Fourth, the confrontation clause of the Sixth

2 Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to

3 meaningful cross-examination of government witnesses at trial.
4 United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, (2d Cir. 2008).

5 Indeed, cross-examination is the principal means by which the

6 believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are

8 With this legal framework in mind, and in light of the
9 parties' extensive briefing on these issues, I think the

10 admissibility of some of the proposed evidence can be

11 determined now, but the admissibility of other evidence will

12 require additional facts and the context of trial to decide,

13 but I think it's important for me to give guidance.

14 Based on the papers before me, I provide the following
15 guidance: First, the Court will preclude affirmative evidence
16 by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the

17 investigation. Although evidence that goes to the thoroughness
18 of the government's investigation can in some cases be relevant
19 and may in some cases be admissible, it's not relevant or
20 admissible if not probative of the defendant's guilt of the
21 crimes charged.
22 In its briefing, the defense relies heavily on Kyles
23 v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 4 (1995), in which the Supreme Court held
24 that an informant's statements to police were material for
25 purposes of Brady disclosures because the statements could be
