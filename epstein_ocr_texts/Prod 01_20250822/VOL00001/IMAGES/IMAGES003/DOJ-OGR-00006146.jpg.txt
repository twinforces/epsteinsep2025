Defendant’s Right Not to Testify
[If requested by defense]
| ThedeferndantMs. Maxwell did not testify in this case. Under our Constitution, a
defendant has no obligation to testify or to present any evidence, because it is the Government’s
burden to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That burden remains with the
Government throughout the entire trial and never shifts to a defendant. A defendant is never
required to prove that she is innocent.
| You may not attach any significance to the fact that the-defendantMs. Maxwell
did not testify.
No adverse inference against the defendantMs. Maxwell may be drawn by you because
the-defendantshe did not take the witness stand. You may not consider this against the-
defendant Ms. Maxwell in any way in your deliberations in the jury room.
