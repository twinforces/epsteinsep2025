average juror will not have knowledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and
Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.

The defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-
by-proxy,” a term which appears nowhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).
By that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can

the victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2020 Tr. at 31:1-34:12, United States v. Randall,

attempt to cabin or limit trauma bonding and coercive control to populations predominately outside
of the alleged victims in this case”). Indeed, expert testimony is commonly offered in sex
trafficking cases on the pimp-prostitute relationship, which is specifically designed to permit the
