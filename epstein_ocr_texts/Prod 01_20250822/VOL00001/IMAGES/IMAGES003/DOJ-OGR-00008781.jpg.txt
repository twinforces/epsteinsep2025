You have heard. evidence during the trial that witnesses have discussed the facts of the

case and.their’testimony withthe Government lawyers, the defense lawyers, or their own lawyers

‘before the witnesses appeared in. court.

Although you. may consider that; fact. when you, are’ evaluating a,witness’s credibility, I
should tell ‘you.that:there is nothing either-unusual or improper about a’witnéss méeting’ with
lawyers before testifying:so that-the'witness can be aware of the subjects he or she will be

questioned ‘about, focus on those subjects, and. have the opportunity. to review relevant. exhibits

‘before being questioned about them. Such, consultation.helps conserve your, time. and the Couit’s’

time. In fact, it would-be unusual for a lawyer to call,a witness without such consultation.

Again, the weight/you give to the fact.or the nature. of the witness’s preparation ‘for his or

her testimony and what inferences you draw from such:preparation are matters: completely within

your discretion.
