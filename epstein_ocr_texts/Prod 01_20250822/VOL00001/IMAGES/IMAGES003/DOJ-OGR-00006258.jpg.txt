hindsight, labeled “grooming” or otherwise imputed 'as knowledge to onlookers. Hindsight bias
‘refers to the'tendency to overestimate: how predictable or foresecablé an. event is after being
informed about the-outcome of an.cvent. Simply put, knowledge of the outcomic of the event, i-c.
Epstein.pleaded. guilty to having, sexual contact with.post-pubescent:minors, makes the:
importance of:pre-conviction’bchaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about.the:
predictability or foresceability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased;compared to
judgments, made’ without. information, about the outcome. Hindsight bias, refers to the tendency. to
overestimate. how predictable an event is. after leatning:the outcome ofthe event (Fischhoff,
1975). For. example, after.a political clection, people belicve:their’ pre-clection estimates of'the

domains inicluding medicine, financial decision making, ¢ consumer satisfaction, and within the
Icgal domain (see Roesé: & Vons, 2012; Arkes, 2013; Strohmaicr Ct. al., 202 I) and ‘using a variety
‘as written vignettes, visual stimuli (c.8., Bernstein & ‘Harley, 2007), and auditory stimuli (c.g.,
Bernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Mcilleur, 2012). Even individuals with specialized training and.
expertise succumb to ‘hindsight bias (Musch, & Wagener, 2007). One: notable: study detected
hindsight bias among actual judgés ‘making civil liability decisions, in which judges with
outcome Knowledge perecived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who ‘did
not receive outcome information.and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence
(Ocberst & Gocckenjan, 2016). Another notable'study detected hindsight’bias in a sample of
mental. health’professionals who gauged the dangcrousness ofa psychiatric patient; again,
outcome knowledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably: of harm posed by: the
patient (Beltrani ct al., 2018).

Hindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to ‘events:
occurring decades ago may be: compromised by this bias in.:many ways, from,the investigation—
either ignoring evidence or attributing significance in hindsight=through the presentation of.
evidence, to the deliberation. of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact ofthe. hitidsight bias
should.temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been-noticed. and
either reported or avoided.and that failing to do so ‘constitutes knowledge or intent.

c. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect:

The term "Halo effect" was coined by Thorndike (1920) a century ago. The Halo effect:is
a. cognitive bias in-impression:formation’whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic
has a.radiating effect on, how other, non-related characteristics of the individual ‘are cvaluated.
Forexample, one classic study found that: physical ‘attractiveness influenced evaluations of the
target's personality, life satisfaction, and expeeted future, personal and dceupational, success —
despite the fact-that:no:information.about any’ of these: attributes was. provided (Dion ct al.,
1972). Physical. attractiveness has also. been found to influence culpability judgments, with.
attractive individuals being held Iess-responsible than unattractive individuals (Dion, 1972;
Efran, 19.74). Halo effects have been, found to be cucd by: factors other than attractiveness, such
as the described status of the target (Wilson, 1968), the name of the target (Harari. & McDavid,
1973), and.cven one's mood when evaluating the:target.(Forgas, 201.1). Studics have. documented
