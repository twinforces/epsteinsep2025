one coconspirator identifying another is in furtherance of conspiracy). Accordingly, this statement
is admissible as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).

This statement is also directly relevant to the charges in the Indictment. Although Epstein
made the statement in 2005, he was discussing a time in the past when the defendant found girls
for him. In other words, this statement references conduct that took place during the period
charged in the Indictment. Epstein was telling Employee-1 that the defendant took precisely the
actions alleged in the Indictment by recruiting girls for Epstein.

2. Second Exemplar

The second exemplar involves instructions provided to Employee-1 by Epstein and
Employee-2, who was also a co-conspirator. In particular, Employee-1 was instructed to go to
Epstein’s Palm Beach residence in October of 2005 and help someone who was coming to remove
computers from the house.

This exemplar is a case in which the Government expects to offer the statement without
use of Rule 801(d)(2)(E). The instructions are not hearsay because the Government will not offer
them for their truth. Rather, these statements are offered to demonstrate their impact on the
listener—Employee-1—in order to explain why Employee-1 removed computers from Epstein’s
Palm Beach house in October of 2005. Asa result, the proffered statement is not hearsay. Dupree,
706 F.3d at 136 (“[A] statement offered to show its effect on the listener is not hearsay.”).

Although this event post-dated the time period contained in the Indictment, it explains why
the members of the Palm Beach Police Department found that computer hard drives appeared to
be missing from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence when they executed a search warrant there on
October 20, 2005. In particular, the Government expects a member of the search team to testify
that during the search, he observed computer monitors and keyboards without any hard drives
