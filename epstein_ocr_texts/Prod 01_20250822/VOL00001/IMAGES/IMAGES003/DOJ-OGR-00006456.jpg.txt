Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 439 _ Filed 11/12/21 Page 39 of 69

Accordingly, the Florida Investigation will already be a central part of the case presented
to the jury. It will not be confusing or distracting to elicit evidence of how that investigation
concluded, as the government contends. See Mot. at 27. In fact, the opposite is true. Without
that evidence, the jury will be left to speculate how and when the Florida Investigation ended,
and whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,
eliciting evidence of how the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)
charged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be
necessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.

The government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial
within a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 290-page report
from the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.
at 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the circumstances
surrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,
given that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of how
the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the resolution
of the investigation. OPR Report at 284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by putting the
NPA at issue in the trial is therefore illusory. It should not be excluded under Rule 403.7°
° The NPA is also not hearsay. It is an agreement that has independent legal significance and is a “verbal
act” “containing legally operative language affecting the rights of the parties” that does not qualify as
hearsay. Spencer v. City of New York, No. 06 Civ. 2852 (KMW), 2011 WL 13257640, at *1 (S.D.N.Y.
