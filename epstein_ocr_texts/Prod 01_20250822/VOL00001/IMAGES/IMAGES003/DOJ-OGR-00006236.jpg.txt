not.reliable. The article that ‘Dr. Dietz relies on—in, fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was
intended ‘as a research agenda to explain. the (undoubted) instances of false: accusations, not, to
provide a roadmap for. establishing the: falsity of any allegation. (SeeEx. C-at 98 (“Part of the
focus of the present: paper, ‘then, 1s, to bring’ attention to the dearth. of psychological ‘literature:
investigating correlates and-causal:mechanisms.of false allegations ofiscxual assault and to propose
a.model. specifying the major causal. pathways to false allegations. These ‘pathways are intended
as @ model for fiirther empirical investigation.’ (emphasis added))). Indeed, the authors were
emphatic that their article not be misused ‘as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy: of
specific accusations.” (Ex. C.at.98 (“[A] legitimate concern about.cnumerating such pathways is
the misuse of psychological diagnosés in determining the accuracy of. specific accusations.”)).

it is simply irrelevant=and highly:prejudicial—for a:psychiatric. expert. to enumerate. a number of
‘mental. disorders: and conjecture. that they ‘could ‘cause. unrcliable: testimony. See; ag, LVI XII
Brands, Inc., 209 F. Supp. 3d at.642. (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where
there is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to'the arguments above, the Court:
believed some of the: opinions on. these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to

the jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidenec at trial

® Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the:
subject. of lay diagnosis’ by the jury, as Dr. Dictz’s notice seems to suggest.
