Re: — United'States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,
assault. Doc. 568. The government’s ‘request for a hearing is ‘premature because based.on
undisputed, publicly available information, the Court can and should order.a new trial without
any evidentiary hearing:

The Supreme Court has held that to be entitled to a new trial, “a party:must first’
demonstrate that a.juror failed to answer honestly'a material. question.on ‘voir dire, and then
further show’ that.a correct response would have'provided,a, valid, basis for a challenge for cause.
MeDonough Power Equip., Ine. ¥. GreenWood,.464 U.S. $48,556 (1984). This standard applies
990.F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir, 1993) (“We read [the MeDonough] multi-part. test, as governing ‘not only’

inadvertent: nondisclosures: but also: nondisclosures or misstatements that were dcliberate.”’).
