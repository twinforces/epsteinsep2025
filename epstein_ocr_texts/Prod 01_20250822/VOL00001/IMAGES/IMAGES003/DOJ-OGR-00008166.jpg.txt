Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
$2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell,'we respectfully submit this letter to request a.
clarification of the Court’s instructions, regarding the use of paper documents versus, clectronic
documents atttrial.. In particular, the defense is still unclear whether we will. be permitted to display.
documents used. for impeachment, or-refreshing a, witness’s recollection in electronic format:solely on the
video sereens used by the witness, the Court, and.the Court?s deputy; or whether we ‘will be required. to,
provide:paper. copies of these materials, even if the materials do not. reference a. witness who jis testifying
under a pseudonym.

The defense is sensitive to the Court and the government’s concerns that-people sitting inthe.
gallery of the courtroom,do not sec any documents that identify the witnesses who are testifying under
pscudonyms. We.also understand that'the; Court'wants to ensure that the witnesses, will have access to

the complete: documents that may. be used for impeachment and. refreshing’ recollection, rather than. a

Counsel forthe defense understood the discussion, on’November'23, 2021, to apply only to. documents which,
contained identifying :information. for, witnesses who are testifying under:pscudonyms or first:names. “The
government, however, has suggested that paper documents need:to be used forall impeachment and.refreshing,

whether. or not the documents contain such identifying :information.
