Age. Age is consistently found 'to be. an, influential factor in

CSA disclosure, making: the life stage of the victim/survivor a,
critical consideration. Studies: draw distinctions. in. age-groups
falling into ‘cither‘under or over 18 years ‘of age. Kighteen-years
of age was the common age cutoff point: that investigators chose
in, order, to distinguish, child/youth populations, from -adult sam-
ples. Sixteen ofthe studies: drew: on samples of children and
youth, while the other 15 studics sampled adults over’the age
of 18,.and a further two studies‘used-mixed-age
