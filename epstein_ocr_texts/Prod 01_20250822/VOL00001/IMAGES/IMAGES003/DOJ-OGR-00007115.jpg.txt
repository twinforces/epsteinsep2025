1 opening.

2 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: Ms. Menninger, anything further on that?

4 MS. MENNINGER: Nothing further on that, your Honor.

5) THE COURT: OK.

6 Anything further in this general category that needs

7 to be addressed now, Ms. Menninger?

8 MS. MENNINGER: If there is no other evidence that the
9 government intends to offer via Rule 404(b), then no. There

10 was a reference to another exhibit -- GX- 416 -- in the

11 government's briefing. That was not one of the exhibits that
12 was mentioned in the Rule 404(b) letter. I assume because it
13 was not mentioned in that letter it cannot be offered through
14 404(b). It is of a same type and characteristic of the e-mail
15 that your Honor has excluded so I don't know what the intent is
16 there.

17 THE COURT: Ms. Moe?

18 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

19 We didn't include that exhibit in our notice. We are
20 offering it as direct evidence, unlike the other evidence which
al were included in our notice. That document is a series of
22 notes. The metadata for that exhibit reflects that the
23 defendant created that series of notes but, unlike the other
24 exhibits outlined in our letter, it doesn't appear that that
25 was directed at a third-party as opposed to Mr. Epstein,
