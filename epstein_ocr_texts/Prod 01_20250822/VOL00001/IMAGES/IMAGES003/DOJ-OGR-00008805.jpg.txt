Respectfully, it is not the proper function-of the Court to contact the Juror and.suggest

that he retain an, attorney orto secure the appointment ofan attorncy on his behalf. There is no
indication this Juror cither:necds a lawyer or is itidigent and qualifics ‘for court-appointed.
counsel. Moreover, any such action-would. undermine the search. for the truth and thus potentially
compromise Ms. Maxwell?s constitutional, right to trial by an impartial jury.

Ms. Maxwell intends to, réquest.a new trial Under Rule 33 beeause:the “interest of justice
so requires.” Fed, R. Crim. P. 33(a). Any submission will include all known, undisputed. remarks
of the Juror; including recorded statements, the relevant questionnaire, and, other non-
ccontroverted ‘facts: It is:clear to.Ms..Maxwell that based on this:record alone a:newtrial is

required. If this Court disagrees, however, Ms. Maxwell requests that a-hearing be scheduled.

| The g government cites United States v. Langford in. support of its request for a hearing.
Doc. 568, p 2. But the hearing in.Langford concerned whether an honest. answer. from. the juror
would.have subjected, her to a challenge for cause duc to bias, i.¢., the second prong of the
MeDonough, multi-part;test. 900 (F.2d at 68-69. Given, the, substance of:the juror’s dishonest
answer—that she had:not been.convicted of or arréstéd for any crimes when, in fact, she had
been. convicted of prostitution.and arrested for larceny—her intent ‘was. relevant to whether she
was biased. An.affirmative answer to the judge’s voir dire question did:not, for that:reason alone,
render the juror’biased in,a case involving controlled. substances.
