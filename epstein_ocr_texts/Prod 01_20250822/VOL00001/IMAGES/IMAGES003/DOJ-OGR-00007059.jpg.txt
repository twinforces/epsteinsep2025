LB1TMAX1
requiring alleged Victims, 'to publicly provide ‘their names, could
chill. their willingness to testify for fear of having their
personal histories publicized. Ranierée, Docket No. 622 at 32,

Given the sensitive and inflammatory nature of the
condtict alleged, Such publicity may cause further Harassment or
embarrassment, and ‘other alleged victims of sex crimes may be
deterred from Comting forward. Sée, Martinez, 17 CR 281,
(BE.D.N.Y, 2017), Docket No, 34.

Limiting the disclosure of allegéd victims" identities
in this case furthers these important interests. The same is.
true with the identities 6f Certain withesses, although n6ét

alleged victims themselves, because the disclosure of ‘theix

idéntities would nécéssarily reveal the identities of the.
alleged victims.
I'm not persuaded by defense counsel's arguments to

the contrary. First, ‘the defense inotes that Ms. Maxwell does

not posé a4 threat to any of the withesses. That is plainly
true, and the government does not argue or suggest or allege
otherwisé, but. just because that reasén f6r limiting
disclosures is absent in this case does not eliminate the
possibility of Other justifications. And again, there is a
need here to prevent, undue embarrassment, barassment. from the
press and third parties, and any resistance of others to Goria
forward and report alleged abuse. Cases establish that this is
sufficient
