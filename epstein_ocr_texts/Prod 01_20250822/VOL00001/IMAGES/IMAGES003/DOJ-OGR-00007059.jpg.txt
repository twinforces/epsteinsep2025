Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document465- Filed 11/15/21 Page 8of127 8

1 requiring alleged victims to publicly provide their names could

2 chill their willingness to testify for fear of having their

i) personal histories publicized. Raniere, Docket No. 622 at 32.

4 Given the sensitive and inflammatory nature of the

5 conduct alleged, such publicity may cause further harassment or

6 embarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be

7 deterred from coming forward. See, Martinez, 17 CR 281,

8 (E.D.N.Y. 2017), Docket No. 34.

9 Limiting the disclosure of alleged victims' identities
10 in this case furthers these important interests. The same is
11 true with the identities of certain witnesses, although not
12 alleged victims themselves, because the disclosure of their
13 identities would necessarily reveal the identities of the
14 alleged victims.

15 I'm not persuaded by defense counsel's arguments to
16 the contrary. First, the defense notes that Ms. Maxwell does
17 not pose a threat to any of the witnesses. That is plainly
18 true, and the government does not argue or suggest or allege
19 otherwise, but just because that reason for limiting
20 disclosures is absent in this case does not eliminate the
21 possibility of other justifications. And again, there is a
22 need here to prevent undue embarrassment, harassment from the
23 press and third parties, and any resistance of others to come
24 forward and report alleged abuse. Cases establish that this is
25 sufficient
