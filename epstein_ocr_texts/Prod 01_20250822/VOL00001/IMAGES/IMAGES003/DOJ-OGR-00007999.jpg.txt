LBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross

1 conclusion of the study, no.

2 Q. Well, are you just saying you ignore the conclusion of the
3 author who did this study because you don't agree with it?

4 A. I'm not saying this is the conclusion. The purpose of the
5 study -- a conclusion generally refers to the concluding

6 comments summarizing the main findings of the study. So this

7 is actually not part of her -- their conclusion. It's part of
8 their rationale for why this particular piece of research is

9 important and needed in the field.

10 Q. So let's go through the methodology of this particular

11 study as well.

12 THE COURT: We'll take about a 20-minute, 30-minute

13 break for lunch. It's 12:55, I think we probably need 30

14 minutes, just logistically, so we'll resume at 1:25.

15 I do want to encourage you, Mr. Pagliuca, to focus

16 your cross less on what you might do in front of a jury --

17 because you are ably demonstrating to me so far that the points
18 you made in your papers are cross-examination points -- so to
19 the extent there are any of the opinions you want to focus on
20 the underlying Daubert questions -- and you did a little bit at
21 the end here -- the time would be much more effectively used.
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Understood, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: Thank you. We'll resume in 30 minutes.
