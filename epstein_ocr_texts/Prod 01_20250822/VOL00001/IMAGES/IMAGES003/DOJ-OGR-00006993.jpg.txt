2 MS. STERNHEIM: OK. The documents, all four of

3 them -- the two questionnaires, the parties' and the Court's,

5 this case, names of participants. Any person who is summoned

6 for jury service, they likely connect their summons with any

7 press coverage there may be with regards to the questionnaire

8 and the jury voir dire questions and this case.

10 questionnaires, they may read coverage, search the media. They
11 are under no obligation or requirement to refrain from that,

12 and we're concerned that that will further have a diluting

13 effect on our ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. We

14 have no problem whatsoever at the moment the jury is sworn,

15 after peremptories have been exercised, that the Court place on
16 the public record all of those documents. This is a procedure
17 that we think can ensure a fair trial for both parties in light
18 of extraordinary media coverage in this case.

19 THE COURT: I need more specifics. You said
20 references to this case, names of participants. The docket now
21 and going forward, as more filings come in, is going to contain
22 names related to this case, names of participants. All of that
23 information is part of the docket in this case, to be sure.
24 That's No. 1. So No. 1 is I don't see how those
25 factors in the questionnaire are particularly different from
