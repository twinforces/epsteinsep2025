1 whether they're going to cross the line from pure fact

2 testimony to expert testimony, I think we can deal with it at
3 that time.

4 THE COURT: OK. What I would just say is, if your

5 expert, looking at the 3500 material and the disclosure, has

6 different expert views, you need to notice those now. But to
7 the extent it's something that comes out at trial, that

8 couldn't have been anticipated, then you can notice down the

] road.

10 So just in terms of what, if your expert has testimony
11 now that's different from what's anticipated in light of the
12 government's notice and the marked exhibits and 3500 material,
13 when would you like to provide additional notice?

14 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, some of the "marked

15 exhibits" are a placeholder for an entire hard drive that has
16 any number of documents on it. If the government is now

17 representing they will only be referring to the documents that
18 are separately marked and not to exhibits that say "hard drive
19 58," â€œhard drive 85," "hard drive 96," we could do that, but
20 they haven't made that representation.
21 THE COURT: Fair enough.
22 MR. ROHRBACH: Those drives are marked for
23 identification for authentication purposes, but to the extent
24 that the point is that Mr. Kelso is going to testify about
25 general principles associated with the creation of documents
