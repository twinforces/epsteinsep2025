for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allowing the
government to circumvent Rule 404(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would
swallow the rule and allow the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered
for a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The
Court should not allow this.

Third, the government claims that  cvidence can be admitted as
intrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to show Ms. Maxwell's (1) “relationship with Epstein,
including her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knowledge of
both the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and
(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further
argues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged
offenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding
that evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar
to the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other
conduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The
government concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admitted some of
the proffered evidence under Rule 404(b). Resp. at 48 n.11. This just proves the point; the
admissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 404(b).

Fourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the
government simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with
access to girls under the age of 18, knowing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with
those girls.” Jd. at 50 (emphasis added). In the government’s view, it is totally irrelevant that
