Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563 _ Filed 12/18/21 Page 118 of 167

1 Instruction No. 28: Count Six: Sex Trafficking of an Individual Under the Age of 18 —

2 Third Element

3 The third element of Count Six which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable

4 doubt is that Ms. Maxwell knew that the person, Carolyn, would be caused to engage in a

5 commercial sex act.

6 The term “commercial sex act” means “any sex act, on account of which anything of

7 ~ value is given to or received by any person.” The thing of value may be money or any other

8 tangible or intangible thing of value that may be given to or received by any person, regardless of

9 whether the person who receives it is the person performing the commercial sex act.
10 It is not relevant whether or not Carolyn was a willing participant in performing
11 commercial sex acts when she was under the age of 18 years old. Consent by the person is not a
12 defense to the charge in Count Six of the Indictment if Carolyn was under the age of 18 at the
13.‘ time the commercial sex acts took place. It is also not required that the person actually
14 performed a commercial sex act so long as the Government has proved that Ms. Maxwell
15 recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained the person for the purpose of
16 = engaging in commercial sex acts.
