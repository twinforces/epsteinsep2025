Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 439-7 Filed 11/12/21 Page7 of 7
When the Topic of Epstein Came Back up with the Miami Herald Article

e Arose when AK was in Securities. AK was no longer the Human Trafficking
Coordinator or the Project Safe Childhood Coordinator.

e AK may have told someone that there had been a presentation for SDNY to prosecute
Epstein. AK read the article and was very disturbed to read about how the case was
resolved in SDFL, which was inconsistent with AK’s assumptions when the case was
presented by the attorneys in February 2016.

e AK remembers speaking with someone in Public Corruption about the February 29, 2016
meeting and shared her notes and emails with Public Corruption.

e AK remembers that someone from the original case team (thinks Alison Moe) came by
her office and they chatted. AK may have also spoken with Alex Rossmiller or Ted
Diskant, but is not sure.

o When speaking with members of the Public Corruption team: AK remembers
telling them that she felt terrible reading the Miami Herald series. AK remembers
telling them that she had the impression that the lawyers who came in to meet
with AK were disorganized, and AK’s impression was that they thought it would
help the CVRA case if SDNY opened a criminal case.

o AK is sure that she gave Alison whatever she had, including the notes that LP
emailed AK. AK handed to Alison whatever was in AK’s folder.

o AK does not remember having any documents or receiving any documents from
the Roberts attorneys.

o AK remembers understanding that Public Corruption had opened an investigation
into Epstein.

e AK did not play any role in opening the SDNY investigation into Epstein.

e To AK’s knowledge, AK has not received any discovery materials from any civil case.
