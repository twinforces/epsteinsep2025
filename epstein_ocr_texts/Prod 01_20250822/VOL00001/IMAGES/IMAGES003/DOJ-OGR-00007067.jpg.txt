LBLTMAX1

by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of
Florida, (3) about the scope and timeline of investigation. .in

Néw York, and (4) 6thér evidence that démonstrates the

government.'s motives for investigating Ms, Maxwell.
The Court's analysis, Heré is gwided by four principles

set by the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court,

First, because the government has no duty to employ,
in. the course of a Single investigation, any particular
‘investigative 'technigtis, the fdiltire to utilize some particular
technique does not tend. to shew that a defendant is not guilty
of the crime 6f which he's beén charged and is therefore
irnnelevant. United States v. Saldarriaga, 204 F.3d4,50, (2d,
Cir. 2000). That's the first legal principle that frames the
discussion, here.

Second, arguments that the gGévernment had an impropér
motive generally must. be directed to the Court rather than the
jury. Unitéd States v. Regan, 103 F.3d 1072, (2d Cir. 1997);
see also, United States v.. Farhane, 634 F.3d 127 (2d Cir.
2011).

Third lJegal ‘principle: There is mo ‘per se bar on
admitting evidence of the Government's charging decisions.
Rather, the Court must -- I will quete here -- "inquire into

its relevance and probative value to the respective case."

United States v. White, 692 E.3d 235 (2d Cir. 2012); see also,

United States v. Ngono, 801 F.App'x. 19 (2d Cin. 2020).
