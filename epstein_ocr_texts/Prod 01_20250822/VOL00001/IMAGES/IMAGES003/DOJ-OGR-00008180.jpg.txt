records. 315 F.R.D. at 445. The Court would exclude Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis for much the same
reasons that court identified. First, the Defense has offered no evidence that diagnosis without
any in-person interview is a reliable and accepted method in Dr. Dietz’s field. /d. at 446.
Second, even if reliable, the opinion risks significant Rule 403 prejudice because the jury is
likely to overweigh Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis. /d. at 447. Expert testimony may not act as a vehicle
to “offer[ ] a narrative history” of the case to the jury or to simply “‘regurgitate’ the evidence”

Dietz does not have a reliable basis for the opinion. Gov’t Br. at 23-25.

The Court will admit this opinion. Dr. Dietz’s notice includes several citations to studies
that link victims of sexual abuse to PTSD, which the Court finds to be a reliable basis for the
opinion. Notice at 11. The Government may of course cross-examine Dr. Dietz about contrary
research. The Government’s other two objections—that the opinion is victim blaming and that it
