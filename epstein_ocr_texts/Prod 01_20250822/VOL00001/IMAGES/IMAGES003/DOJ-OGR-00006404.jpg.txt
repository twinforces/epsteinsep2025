defendant has emphasized these witness statements, and claimed that they are exculpatory. (See,
e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. 138 at 7-11; Letter, Dkt. 64 at 1; Mot., Dkt. No. 346 at 2 n.1).

As explained above, as a general matter, “evidence of good conduct that does not refute
evidence of the offense charged” is inadmissible. United States v. Rivera, No. 13 Cr. 149
(KAM), 2015 WL 1725991, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2015). The Government will not contend
at trial that the defendant personally participated in the abuse of all of Epstein’s victims, and it is
not a defense to claim that the defendant is not guilty of crimes with which she is not charged.

Maxwell’s name and she was never considered a suspect.” (Mem. of Law, Dkt. 138 at 10-11).
The Court rejected this argument, explaining that the testimony the defendant suggested that the
detective might have offered “is propensity evidence that does nothing to establish her innocence
of the charged offenses.” (Opinion & Order, Dkt. 207 at 18); see United States v. Raniere, 384
F. Supp. 3d 282, 325 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (rejecting a motion for discovery because “statements by
individuals who were not allegedly directed to have sex with [the defendant] or were not
threatened with the release of collateral in exchange for acts of care are not Brady material
because they have no bearing on whether the alleged victims were so directed or threatened”’).

Moreover, the Government notes that evidence of these encounters is only admissible
through the victims themselves. Any other method of eliciting that evidence, such as through
