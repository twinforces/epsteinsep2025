The issues in this case, by contrast, are far from simple: accusers making allegations
decades after the alleged events after reading, hearing, and speaking about the events with others,
barraged by media coverage, and motivated by monetary gain. Most of the accusers have spoken
publicly and all have received large settlements from the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund.
Their “memories” have changed dramatically over time and conveniently began to include Ms.
