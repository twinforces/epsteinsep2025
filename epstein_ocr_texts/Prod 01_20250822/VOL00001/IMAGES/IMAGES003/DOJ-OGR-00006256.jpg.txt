a. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions

The first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable
nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition
that “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a
combination of kindness, attention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are
expertly applied” (Conte, 1984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by
social scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended
consequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:

(1) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is

intentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to

prevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning

beyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without

adequate evidence of either.

(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable

behaviors as being kind or attentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of

misleading the fact finder into believing that these latter behaviors are well established

predictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and

Seduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 31 (2018). Dr. Rocchio characterizes

“srooming” as “a strategic pattern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and

function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and

to build trust and attachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”

carries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination

of motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility

of witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion

carries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated

with nefarious or criminal conduct.
