Despite'the government’s confidence, Court Exhibit #15 indicates that the jury’is
considering a conviction on Count Four based on Jane’s travel to'and from.New Mexico'and.
alleged sexual abuse that purportedly took:place in.New Mexico. Should:the jury: convict-on this
basis, it would bea constructive amendment and/or a:varianee ftom, the express language of Count
Four: Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts, that: she ‘purportedly.
engaged in there in-violation of New York law are part of the “core of. criminality” :charged. in
Count Four. See Wozniak, 126 F.3d at 109-111 (finding constructive amendment where
trial focused. on. marijuana). A.conviction. based ‘on Jane’s travel to and from: New Mexico and any
‘sexual, activity that allegedly occurred while 'she was there would. be premised. on:facts clicited, at
trial that are “completely distinet” fromthe. allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2017 WL
4685111, at *20. If the Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot ‘convict Ms. Maxwell on.
‘Count Four'based on the alleged. events in New Mexico; ‘it: would permit: the jury to convict Ms.
Maxwell of'an offense “other than.that charged in the: indictment” and constitute a:constructive
amendment. /d. A.constructive amendment like this is. perse reversible crror without a showing
of prejudice. United States ¥. Frank, 156 F.3d.332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. 1998).

At the very’ least, if the jury:convicts: Ms. Maxwell on,Count:Four based.on Jane’s alleged
sexual, activity in-New: Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations, in the $2
Indictment, which requires an:intent that Jane travel.to New York and violate New York law.. The.
Court should instruct the jury:as requested’ below to prevent such a-variance from occurring. Ms.

Maxwell has no burden. to, prove’ prejudice at/this point; since the variance can still be:prevented. by’
