Re: United States-v. Ghislaine, Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government:respectfully:submits this letter regarding birth certificates that-are marked
as Government. Exhibits for trial.' By ‘way of background, the Government has obtained and.
‘produced to, the defense certified copies of the birth certificates for cach of the Minor Victims.
(See GX-1.1-16). Although. the Government has asked. the defense to stipulate to the authenticity
of these ‘records, and although the defense has identified, no ‘reason to doubt the: authenticity of
relief in the instant motion, to which, itis entitled under the law, and to avoid. calling: records

custodians ftom five state agencics with custody over the birth certificates.”

The Government nioves to file a redacted version this lctter:motion. The proposed redactions
are:consistent with.the:three-part.test articulated. by the Second Circuit in.Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.

of Onondaga, 435 F.3d. 110. (2d Gir. 2006). Although this lettcr..motion «is a judicial. document
subject. to the common law presumption of access, the proposed. redactions. are ‘narrowly tailored.
to'protcet the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not; becn’publicly identified,
and who are a.subject: of the Court’s order granting 'the motion to let certain victims and witnesses
testify under pscudonyms, and third-parties.

? The Government is coordinating with Department of' Justice: Office of International Affairs to
further establish the predicates for sclf-authentication of Witness-3’s birth certificate and -will
make the appropriate ‘motion when it is, ripe. See Fed. R. Evid. 902(3).
