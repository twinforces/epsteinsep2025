LB15max4

THE COURT: So to ‘thé extent ‘there 1s overlap in ‘these
issues, it's best to take it up in the 412 preceeding so that
we Gan, discuss the issues, without Violdting that rule.
Defendant's 13. This is. a metion to preclude the
admission of sévérdl Exhibits. T'm going to grant the motion
with respect to Exhibit 251 and 288, Based on the briefing
before me, 401 relévance is minimal, at best, and outweighed by
403 prejudice. 294, so some of the same questions around the

atithehticGation issué 86 T think that ruling holds. T won't

otherwise preclude this evidence. It is potentially

corroborative evidence of testimony and 403 prejudice does hot
rule out 401 but the defense can maintain ‘the search and
duthenticdtion issues that we have discussed.

Exhibit 403 I won't preclude, it's potentially

probative of the relationship between the defendant and

Mr. Epstein. Ihe government, proffers that it will corneborate
and that the photos would Gorrdéborate anticipated witness
testimony and £ don't -- so, there ds 401, melevance and, not
substaéntidlly outweighed by any 403 prejudice.

On this last. one I may have said the wrong number. I
had 403 of minés So, Exhibit 313 is the photograph that I have
indicated I am not excluding, it is potentially probative of

the rélationship between the defendant and Mr. Epstein and hot

outweighed by prejudice.

And then 606, this is the issue on authentication. and
