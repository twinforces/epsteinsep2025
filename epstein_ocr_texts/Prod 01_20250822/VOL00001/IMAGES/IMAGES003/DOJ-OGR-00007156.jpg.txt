1 THE COURT: So to the extent there is overlap in these
2 issues, it's best to take it up in the 412 proceeding so that

3 we can discuss the issues without violating that rule.

4 Defendant's 13. This is a motion to preclude the

5 admission of several exhibits. I'm going to grant the motion

6 with respect to Exhibit 251 and 288. Based on the briefing

7 before me, 401 relevance is minimal, at best, and outweighed by
8 403 prejudice. 294, so some of the same questions around the

9 authentication issue so I think that ruling holds. I won't

10 otherwise preclude this evidence. It is potentially

11 corroborative evidence of testimony and 403 prejudice does not
12 rule out 401 but the defense can maintain the search and

13 authentication issues that we have discussed.

14 Exhibit 403 I won't preclude, it's potentially

15 probative of the relationship between the defendant and

16 Mr. Epstein. The government proffers that it will corroborate
17 and that the photo would corroborate anticipated witness

18 testimony and I don't -- so, there is 401 relevance and not

19 substantially outweighed by any 403 prejudice.
20 On this last one I may have said the wrong number. I
21 had 403 on mine. So, Exhibit 313 is the photograph that I have
22 indicated I am not excluding, it is potentially probative of
23 the relationship between the defendant and Mr. Epstein and not
24 outweighed by prejudice.
25 And then 606, this is the issue on authentication and
