Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 83 of 93
Use of Evidence from Searches
You have heard testimony about evidence seized in connection with certain searches

conducted by law enforcement officers. Evidence obtained from these searches was properly
admitted in this case, and may be properly considered by you. Such searches were appropriate
law enforcement actions. Whether you approve or disapprove of how the evidence was obtained
should not enter into your deliberations, because I instruct you that the Government’s use of the
evidence is entirely lawful. You must, therefore, regardless of your personal opinions, give this
evidence full consideration along with all the other evidence in the case in determining whether
the Government has proven the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As with all
evidence, it is for you to determine what weight, if any, to give such evidence.

Adapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States

v. Lebedev, 15 Cr. 769 (AJN).
