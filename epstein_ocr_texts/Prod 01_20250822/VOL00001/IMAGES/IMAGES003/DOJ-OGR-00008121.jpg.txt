Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 509-1 Filed 11/24/21 Page 10 of 10
1997). The case the defendant cites is not to the contrary. (See Opp. 16). There a civil
defendant asked to exclude expert testimony on the grounds that the witnesses had given
deposition testimony at odds with their proffered trial testimony. R.B. Ventures, Ltd. v. Shane,

91 Civ. 5678 (CSH), 2000 WL 520615, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 1, 2000). The court’s disagreement
thus was not a ruling on prior inconsistent statements at all, but rather a statement of the obvious
point that witnesses can still give direct testimony even if they might then be impeached with
prior inconsistent statements during cross-examination. See id.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above and in the Government’s initial memorandum, the
Government respectfully requests that the Court preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony.
