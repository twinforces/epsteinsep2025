Fed. R. Evid. 803(6).

Pages 3 to’6 of the government’s letter rehash arguments the government has already
‘made and this Court has alréady rejected. Ms. Maxwell will not repeat here why these: argunients
fail. (Ms. Maxwell. incorporates those arguments by reference.)

What’s. new is the government’s attempt to rely‘on Ms. Maxwell’s,April 201.6 deposition
Deposition Exhibit 13. The government’s reliance is not-persuasive.

First, Deposition, Exhibit: 131s of the same thing as, Exhibit, 52. Deposition Exhibit 13 is
a:photocopy: of some pages: of some document: There is no explanation. from where the
photocopy came, when it'was made, who made it, what it purports to be a copy of, whether it,is a
complete copy, or whcther'itas an. accurate copy. Whatever it is, it,is not'a copy of Exhibit 52. (It
has, for example, several handwritten.pages that aren’t contained :in:the government’s trial
exhibit.) Quite ‘simply, Ms. Maxwell was ‘not asked and, did not:testify about Exhibit ‘52: or its
authenticity.

This is no trivial matter. As Mr. Alessi explained in testimony this Court deemed
inadequate: to authenticate the exhibit, Exhibit; 52 is ‘not. the same as the books he saw’ during his
employment with Mr..Epstcin. The: books in-use when-he was:an employee were two ‘inches
