1 I anticipate that we'll break for lunch at 1 p.m., and
2 then start with the afternoon panel at 2 p.m.

3 We're going to be directing each panel to come back in
4 accordance with that schedule. I do anticipate stopping at

S 5 otclock each day.

6 When they are here for their individual questioning,

7 they are going to be seated there in the witness box in the

8 seat, is my anticipation, with a microphone. And we will do

9 the questioning in the public courtroom, with the exception of
10 if the juror has indicated on their questionnaire that they

11 request a specific answer to remain confidential, because it

12 would be embarrassing or otherwise concerning for them, which
13 we did in order to encourage full disclosure and openness and
14 ultimately to get a fair and impartial jury, to the extent we
15 need to discuss those questions with any jurors, we will do

16 that at sidebar. And my anticipation is we'll seal that

17 portion of the transcript, to the extent it discusses that

18 private information that the juror has asked to remain

19 confidential.
20 I think just looking at the questionnaires, that
al shouldn't happen too frequently. And otherwise the voir dire
22 will take place in public.
23 Next, we'll move thoroughly but efficiently through
24 the process to make sure that we can get through it in the time
25 that we have. I've given you an outline of what I will intend
