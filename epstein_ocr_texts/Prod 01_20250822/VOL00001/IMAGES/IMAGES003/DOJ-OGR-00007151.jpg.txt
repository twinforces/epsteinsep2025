1 the defense to engage in the full set of questions that counsel
2 has indicated, but for purposes of the in limine motion, it's

3 denied.

4 Defense 19. Here, the defense seeks to suppress

5 alleged Victim-4's identification of Ms. Maxwell on the ground
6 that the government used unduly suggestive photo array

7 procedures that violate due process rights.

8 I am prepared to deny this motion. Eyewitness

9 identifications should be excluded when improper police conduct
10 created a substantial likelihood of misidentification. Perry
11 v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, (2012).

12 I follow a two-step analysis in ruling on the

13 admissibility of identification evidence. First, I must

14 determine whether the pretrial identification procedures were
15 unduly suggestive. Some examples of suggestive procedures

16 include using a very small number of photographs, making

17 suggestive comments, or the display of the accused in a way

18 that so stood out from all other photographs to suggest to an
19 identifying eyewitness that the person was more likely to be
20 the culprit. See, United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369,
21 (2d Cir. 1992).
22 Looking at the photo array, neither the photos used or
23 the procedure itself was unduly suggestive. The array
24 contained a sufficient number of photos larger than many arrays
25 that courts have held were not unduly suggestive. Defense's
