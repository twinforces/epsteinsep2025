the defensé to engage in the full set of questions that counsel
has indicated, but for purposes of the in limine motion, it"s
denied.

Defense 19. Here, the defense seeks to suppress

alleged Vietim-4's identification of Ms. Maxwell on the ground
that the government used unduly suggestive photo array
procedures that violate due process rights.

I am prepared to deny this motion. Eyewitness
identifications should be excluded when improper police conduct
created a substantial Likelihood of misidentification. Perry
v. New Hampshiré, 565 U.S; 228, (2012).

I follow a two-step analysis in ruling on, the
admissibility of identificatid6n evidence. First, I must

determine ‘whether ‘t

he pretrial identification procedures were
unduly suggestive. Some examples of suggestive procedures
include using a yerny small number of photographs, makang
Suggestive comments, 6r the display of the accused in a way
that so stood out from all other photographs to suggest to an
idéntifying eyewitness that the person was more likely to be
the culprit, See, United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369,
(20 Cir. 1992).

Looking at the photo array, neither the photos used or
the procedure itsélf was unduly suggestive. The array

Gontained a sufficient number of photos larger than many arrays

that courts have held were not unduly suggestive. Defense's
