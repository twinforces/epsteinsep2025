Victims and witnesses by narrowing the field of people whose careers match the description
elicited by the defense at the times elicited by the defense, and in combination with the other
information about them that will be available at trial.

Second, the Government seeks clarification that the Court’s November 1, 2021 order
permitting witnesses to testify using pseudonyms or first names includes an order barring
courtroom sketch artists from drawing the exact likeness of those individuals. (See Gov’t Mot. in
Limine, Dkt. No. 380, at 16 n.7 (making this request)); see May 6, 2019 Text Order, Raniere, 18
Cr. 204 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y.) (“Sketch artists . .. may not draw exact likenesses of jurors or witnesses
other than co-defendants should they testify ....”). It would defeat the purpose of the Court’s
order if the exact likeness of those witnesses could be drawn and subsequently publicized in the
media. Although courtroom sketch artists might voluntarily elect not to sketch these witness’s
faces, the Government seeks an order so it can provide certainty to these witnesses in advance of
their testimony.

' The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although
this letter is a judicial document subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed
redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of the witnesses whom the Court
has authorized to testify using pseudonyms or their first names.
