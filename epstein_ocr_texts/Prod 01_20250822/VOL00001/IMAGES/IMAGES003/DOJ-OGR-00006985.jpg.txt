1 THE COURT: Go ahead.
2 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, at this point do we know
3 how many jurors will be summoned and how many the Court is
4 planning to select for the final voir dire?
5) THE COURT: Yes. What I can tell you -- and again, I
6 just want to say an enormous thanks to the jury department, who
7 I've been working with closely on this for months, as you can
8 imagine. The return rate in the Covid era has gone up and down
9 on summonses, but we have estimated our ability to administer
10 the questionnaire over the three days in a morning and
11 afternoon panel each day; the goal was 600 jurors, if we need
12 it.
13 That's the answer to question one.
14 Question two I was going to get to the exercise of
15 peremptories in a moment.
16 I'm sorry. Maybe I misunderstood.
17 What was question No. 2, Ms. Sternheim?
18 MS. STERNHEIM: It was how many you are going to
19 ultimately have us select to sit.
20 THE COURT: Yes. OK. I thought I had that in a prior
21 order, but my intention is to sit six alternates, so we'll have
22 a jury of 18.
23 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
24 THE COURT: OK. Are there other questions on what was
25 discussed so far, Ms. Sternheim?
