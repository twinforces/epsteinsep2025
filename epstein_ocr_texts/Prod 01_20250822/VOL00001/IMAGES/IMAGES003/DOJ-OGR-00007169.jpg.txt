1 think the defense is well equipped to print those materials and
2 meet with the defendant in person about it as they have been

3 doing. They can certainly discuss those documents in the video
4 conferences that they're having with the defendant. Our

a understanding is that this defense team has a large amount of

6 access to video conferencing sessions with this defendant and

7 so when the defense receives those materials, they're certainly
8 free to review those with the defendant in real-time in their

9 sessions.

10 And so, we are taking every step that we can to ensure
11 that the defense and the defendant have those materials but we
12 think those steps are all that is required here and certainly
13 more than is necessary to make sure the defendant is apprised
14 of those materials in anticipation of trial.

15 THE COURT: As to the steps, if you have a new

16 submission we are talking about newly produced 3500 material,
17 limited volume; correct, Ms. Moe?

18 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

19 THE COURT: And you are going to send that by FedEx â€”--
20 so overnight -- to the facility in each instance, correct?
21 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: And you alert BOP counsel, MDC Legal
23 counsel that something is coming for Ms. Maxwell so they can be
24 on alert. Do you get indication back from legal counsel that
25 it's been received and delivered?
