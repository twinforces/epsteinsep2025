think the defense is well equipped to print those materials and
meet with the defendant in person about it as they have been
doing. They can cértainly discuss those documents in ‘the video
conferences that they '.re having with the defendant. Our
understanding is that this défense team has a large dmount of

access to video conferencing sessions with this defendant and

so when the defense receives those materials, they'ré Gertdinly
free to review those with the defendant in. real-time in their
sessions.

And so, we are taking every step that we can to ensure

that the defense and the déeféndant have those materials but we

think ‘those steps. are all ‘that js mequired here and, certainly

more than is nécessary to make sure the defendant is apprised

of those materials in antacipation, of trial.
