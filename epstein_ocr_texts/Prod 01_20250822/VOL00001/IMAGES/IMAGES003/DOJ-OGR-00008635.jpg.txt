] Instruction No.9: |The Indictment
2 The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been formally charged in what is called an
3 “Indictment.” As I instructed you at the outset of this trial, the Indictment is simply a charge or
4 accusation. It is not evidence. It is not proof of Ms. Maxwell’s guilt. It creates no presumption
5 and it permits no inference that Ms. Maxwell is guilty. Ms. Maxwell begins trial with an
6 absolutely clean slate and without any evidence against her. You must give no weight to the fact
7 ~ that an Indictment has been returned against Ms. Maxwell.
8 I will not read the entire Indictment to you at this time. Rather, I will first summarize the
9 offenses charged in the Indictment and then explain in detail the elements of each of the offenses.
