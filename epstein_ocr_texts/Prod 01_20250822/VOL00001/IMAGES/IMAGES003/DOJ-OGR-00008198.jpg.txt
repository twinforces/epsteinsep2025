Criminal Procedure, and nothing in any of them, suggests that impeachment-evidence is.

Because Ms. ‘Maxwell offered the photograph while cross-examining Jane during the
government’s case-in-chicf and not as “evidence ‘in chicf” during'her own “‘case-in-chief,”
Moore, 208 F.3d at 579, she did not.violate Rule 16, and there is no basis to preclude her from
admitting the photograph into evidence.

But: even if the government’s reading of Rule 16(b)(1)(A). were right (which it isn’t), and
even. if. Ms. Maxwell had.violated Rule 16:(which she didn’t), exclusion would still not-be the
proper. remedy. “Ifa, party ‘fails to comply with [Rule 16], the court:may: (A) order'that-party to
permit the discovery or inspection; specify its time, place, and mariner; and:prescribe other just
terms and conditions; (B) grant a ‘continuance; (C) prohibit that party from introducing the:
‘undisclosed evidence; or (D) enter any'other order that. is just. under the: circumstances.” Fed. R.
16(d)(2)(A)-(D). Prohibiting a-party from introducing the evidence is the most extreme sanction
available, and. it:requires proof that the belated disclosure prejudiced the government. See United
States v. Monsanto Lopez, 798 FE. App’x 688,690 (2d. Cir. 2020); see also. Passlogix, Iné. v. 2A
Tech., LLC, 708 F. Supp..2d'378, 421 (S.D.N-Y. 201.0) (“Preclusion. is a harsh. sanction
preserved for exceptional cases where a. . .'party’s failure to provide the requested discovery

results in-prejudice to the requesting:party.”).?

? It is well-settled that“[t]o exclude evidence on the grounds of a discovery violation, a,
criminal. défendant must show prejudice resulting from the governnient’s untimely disclosure of
evidence. . ..° Uitited States v. Cantoni, No. 18-CR-562 (ENV),.201.9 WL.1264899, at *1
