Morcover, grooming has'no consistent definition, ‘and. concerns. have, been raised. that
“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalic:
Bennett & William. O’ Donohue, The Construct:of Groomiiig in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child
Sexual. Abuse 957, 974 (2014). -

In. any particular population of alleged, victims, patients, or plaintiffs—ineluding those
whom. Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has
occurred is.a subjective judgment hinging largely.on the credibility of the individuals. Such
judgments. have no known. crror rate and. cannot be tested, verified, or: reproduced.

Although the Government’s. Expert Notice regarding’Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony
is silent as to Whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the
Defendant, it:is important to note, that'there. is no generally accepted ‘theory of g grooming, by third
partics.or empirical evidence regarding ‘the prevalence, characteristics, or: mechanisms of such a
phenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for
herself. Instead, the claim appears to be’that Ms. Maxwell recruited ‘and. groomed. minors to
provide sexualized. massages for Mr. Epstein, which ‘would, amount to grooming-by-proxy.

Dr. Dictz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no:studics, no tests, nothing—to
support:a, theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such.a theory’has not gained any acceptance (let: alone
general acecptanec) iin’the relevant; community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and
cannot: be’ tested; and there ‘is no known. or potential, rate of -crror.

Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular-vulncrabilitics are often. targeted
by perpetrators ofisexual, abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived. from the
frequent: observation of highly vulnerable children,among those children who ‘allege sexual
abuse, but itis not:bascd on empirical data regarding’ the likelihood of abuse among children
‘with varying, degirces of vulnerability: To the extent that less vulnerable children, such,as those
with intact familics, attentive: ‘parents, good social support, little: psychopathology, less:prior
trauma, no substance'use, and higher 1 resilicnee are: less likely to: allege abuse than the more
vulnerable, the g gencralization could be proved. weak or false, if only there were such empirical
data. And even if there'were such data, it;would. be ‘important to devise a‘mcans of verifying that
abuse did, occur to those who allege it, which.s a-difficult task at best,because of the pains so
many abuscrs take to-avoid confession, witnesses, orphysical evidence. The clinical, criminal
justice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent-vulncrabilitics is.
derived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated. or evaluated—rarcly represent
groups in which all allegations of ‘abuse, have been. verified by confession, witnesses, physical.
evidence, or other rrieans.

Other opinions put forth in.the disclosure: of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed.testimony also rest
on assertions that are untestable, cannot be ‘reproduced, and have no known crror rate.

b: Opinions About Hindsight Bias

Hindsight bias must’be considered:when, evaluating scx abuse allegations and or
“grooming behavior.” Many claims of:sexual, abuse of ‘minors involve behaviors that.are, in.
