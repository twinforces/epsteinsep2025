Ms. Maxwell had no obligation (and has no obligation going forward) to disclose to the
government any evidence (e.g., books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects,
buildings or places) she does not intend to use during her “case-in-chief.” Fed. R. Crim. P.
16(b)(1)(A). Requiring such disclosure would violate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. U.S.
Const. amends. V, VI. This Court should reject the government’s contrary argument.
