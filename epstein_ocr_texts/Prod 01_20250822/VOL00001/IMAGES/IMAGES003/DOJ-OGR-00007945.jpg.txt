1 particular the person I was evaluating talked about how he

2 thought that the person who eventually abused him was a really
3 good guy because there was another older person involved in the
4 troop, and they were best friends. And so he really thought

5 this other guy was really cool, and that was how he, you know,
6 came to kind of be introduced and involved in the relationship.
7 There's a --— there was a -- in a clinical setting,

8 I've certainly talked with individuals where, you know, I've

9 talked about that part of, why they came to trust someone and
10 initially started the relationship with them was because either
11 they looked cool or they knew someone that they knew or they

12 were introduced by a friend or a teacher. So in those settings
13 certainly I've -- it's something that happens.

14 THE COURT: Does it surprise you, then, there's no

15 discussion in the literature of that specific phenomenon?

16 THE WITNESS: I think that it's -- no, because I think
17 what I'm talking about is specific ways in which individuals

18 are kind of disarmed or come to trust others, so within the

19 literature the phenomenon of what kinds of things, like -- can
20 create an aura of trust and respectability, that is certainly
21 discussed in the literature. But I think that the example
22 you're asking me about is so highly specific, I think it would
23 fall under the category of a number of things that are
24 discussed, but I'm not aware of it having been discussed that
25 specifically.
