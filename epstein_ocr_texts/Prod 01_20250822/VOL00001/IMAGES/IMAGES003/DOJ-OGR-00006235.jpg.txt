91, 101 (2d Cir. 2001) (“[T]he district court should not admit testimony that is directed solely to
lay matters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

Even as to the opinions that involve psychological conditions, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are not
helpful to the jury. While Dr. Dietz’s descriptions of antisocial personality disorder, borderline
personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychotic disorders, delirium, dissociation,
and intellectual disability at least involve Dr. Dietz’s psychiatric training in some way (unlike
pathways such as “lying”), it is hardly beyond the ken of juries to know that mental disorders or
altered mental states may at times motivate people to dissemble or to believe things that are not
true. Attempting to put the imprimatur of an expert on a variety of ways in which mental disorders
can lead to unreliable testimony is simply an attempt to invade the province of the jury by putting
a thumb on the scale in their assessment of witness credibility.’ See, e.g., Nimely, 414 F.3d at 398
(“[E]xpert opinions that constitute evaluations of witness credibility, even when such evaluations
are rooted in scientific or technical expertise, are inadmissible under Rule 702”); United States v.
Lumpkin, 192 F.3d 280, 289 (2d Cir. 1999) (barring expert from testifying as to scientific principle
related to the assessment of witness credibility as impinging on jury’s role).

To the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinions include something outside the ken of the average jury—
specifically, that these “pathways” purportedly occur frequently in sexual assault cases—they are
7Dr. Dietz should in any event not offer his opinions on false memory, which are apparently
derivative of Dr. Loftus’s. Given that the defense has noticed Dr. Loftus as a witness, if any false
memory testimony is appropriate, it should come from Dr. Loftus, whose research it is based on,
not from Dr. Dietz summarizing Dr. Loftus’s research. The admissibility of Dr. Loftus’s testimony
on false memory is discussed in Section II, infra.
