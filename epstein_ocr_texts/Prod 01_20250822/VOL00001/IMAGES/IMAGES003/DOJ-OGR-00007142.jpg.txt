1 THE COURT: Defendant's 6 is evidence of the

2 defendant's alleged false statements and regarding redacting

3 allegations related to the perjury counts in the indictment,

4 which I severed. The government has agreed not to introduce

5 evidence of these alleged false statements and agrees to the

8 MS. MOE: No, your Honor.

9 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor, thank you.

15 Honor, thank you.

16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I think we do need to

25 government, assume that for a moment, we don't know where it
