Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document507 Filed 11/24/21 Page 26 of 28

Accordingly, the Court should preclude expert testimony from Kelso and Lopez unless and
until the defense to provides supplemental expert notice forthwith.!* If the defense does so, the
Government should have an opportunity at that time to litigate its admissibility. And if the defense
does not do so, those witnesses should be limited to purely factual testimony. See Lebedev, 932
F.3d at 50 (affirming a limiting instruction clarifying that the witness was not providing an expert
opinion).

B. Forensic Document Specialists

Finally, the defendant has identified two forensic document specialists who she may call
as expert witnesses. Gerald LaPorte is a “Forensic Chemist and Document Dating Specialist,” and
Jennifer Naso is a “Forensic Document Examiner.” (Ex. A at 13-14). Regarding their expert
opinions, the defendant writes:

Defendant anticipates the receipt of documents produced by
the government and documents received pursuant to defense
subpoena included but not limited to journal pages by witness
[Minor Victim-2]. These documents may require analysis
regarding the dates of creation, completeness, alteration and
manipulation. When these documents are disclosed,
Defendant will seek to have them analyzed and present
testimony on the analysis as needed.
(Id. at 13-14).

This notice also does not provide the experts’ “opinions” or “the bases and reasons for
those opinions.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). It does not even identify the set of documents
Similarly, absent additional expert notice, Kelso and Lopez should be required to limit their
testimony to facts in the record. Experts—but not other witnesses—may rely on facts or data that
are not admissible, and may disclose them to the jury in certain circumstances. See Fed. R. Evid.
703, 705.
