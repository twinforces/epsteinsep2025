a. defendant cross-cxamines.a government witness'to buttress her theory oftthe case, rather than to
impeach the testimony given, by the witness on direct examination, the cross-cxamination, is
properly secn as part.of the defendant’s case-in-chief.” Wnited States v. Napout, No. 15 Cr. 252
(PKC),.2017 W.L.6375729, at *7 (E.D.N.Y.. Dec. 12, 2017) (quoting United States v. Hsai, No. 98
Cr. 75 (PLF), 2000. WL 195067, at, *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 12, 2000)) (altcrations. and. internal quotation

“frustrat[ing] the: practical intentions behind Rule 16: to avoid. unfair ‘surprise and ‘unwarranted.
delay by’ providing ‘both, the government and the defense with, a. broad, reciprocal, right: to
discovery.” United States v. Crowder, 325 F.Supp. 3d 131 (Mem.) (D.D.C. Sept. 24, 2018).

The defendant’s Rule 16 disclosures were due on/November 8, 2021. (Dkt.'No. 297 at 2).
Accordingly, any. exhibits ‘which the defense intends to offer as, part of its case-in=-chief, whether
