Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document517 Filed 11/30/21 Page2of4
a defendant cross-examines a government witness to buttress her theory of the case, rather than to
impeach the testimony given by the witness on direct examination, the cross-examination is
properly seen as part of the defendant’s case-in-chief.” United States v. Napout, No. 15 Cr. 252
(PKC), 2017 WL 6375729, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 12, 2017) (quoting United States v. Hsai, No. 98
Cr. 75 (PLF), 2000 WL 195067, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 12, 2000)) (alterations and internal quotation

Cir. 2001) (affirming exclusion of evidence offered through cross-examination as part of the
defense’s “evidence in chief,” under the prior language of Rule 16, due to the defense’s failure to

reasoning is simple: a contrary rule would “permit defendants to evade pretrial disclosure simply
by presenting much (or all) of their case-in-chief before the government rests,” thereby
“frustrat[ing| the practical intentions behind Rule 16: to avoid unfair surprise and unwarranted
delay by providing both the government and the defense with a broad, reciprocal right to
discovery.” United States v. Crowder, 325 F. Supp. 3d 131 (Mem.) (D.D.C. Sept. 24, 2018).

The defendant’s Rule 16 disclosures were due on November 8, 2021. (Dkt. No. 297 at 2).
Accordingly, any exhibits which the defense intends to offer as part of its case-in-chief, whether
through Government witnesses or its own, should have been disclosed at that time. The
Government of course understands that there are circumstances in which intervening event may
