1 THE COURT: OK. Thank you.

2 Those are the four lists.

3 For the questionnaires completed on November 4th and

4 Sth, those lists will be due to the Court via email by November
5 7. For questionnaires completed on November 12, the lists will
6 be due by email by November 13, and that's so I can let the

7 jury department know who to call back for voir dire.

8 I am setting a placeholder conference, an in-person

9 placeholder conference for November 15 at 9:30 a.m. to resolve
10 disputes, as needed, with respect to for-cause strikes based on
11 the questionnaire.

12 That's the questionnaire process.

13 T'll turn now to voir dire.

14 On November 16th through 19th, if we need all of those
15 days, I will then conduct voir dire of the individual jurors

16 who have been brought back, asking appropriate follow-up

17 questions based on questionnaire responses, some additional

18 questions more appropriately asked during oral voir dire, and
19 background information that will enable the Lawyers to gather
20 substantial information in aid of the exercise of informed
21 peremptory challenges. And yesterday, I sent the parties my
22 draft voir dire, which we will also discuss in a moment.
23 I will conduct this as one-on-one voir dire with each
24 prospective juror in the presence of the parties and with
25 public access to the proceedings. We will do this one juror at
