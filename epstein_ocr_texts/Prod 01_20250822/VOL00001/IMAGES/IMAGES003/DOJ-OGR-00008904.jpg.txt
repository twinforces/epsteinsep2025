But there is no “higher valuc” or. “competing consideration” that is:more compelling or
more important than, protecting Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair trial. See Silver, 2016

‘interests: may include the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”)). Scaling is warranted to protect:a
defendant's fair trial rights if the Court makes specific findings that.“first, there is a-substantial

‘structural error that oecurred,during the ‘voir dire process. Ms. Maxwell’s. fair trial rights must be
proteeted post-trial just as vigorously as:they ate pre-trial. To do that, it is necessary to keep the

Motion temporarily: scaled.
