1 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I can assure you we've

2 attempted to. We raised issues that we thought are clearly not
3 proper ground for cross-examination, like arrests as a juvenile
4 for curfew violations, misdemeanor convictions that are more

5 than ten years old, things that have nothing do with

6 credibility, and the defense told us that they cannot assure us
7 that they will not raise those issues on cross. We obviously

8 need a pretrial ruling so that we know whether we have to raise
9 those things on direct to draw the sting.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, this is not a surprise to
11 me that this is being raised, but this is a surprising issue, I
12 think, to be raised. The list, laundry list of things that the
13 government wants to talk about include things that are clearly
14 within the rules, and --

15 THE COURT: I don't want a speech. What I want, it

16 sounds like they're saying there are things that are clearly

17 outside of the rules, in their view. And you say there are

18 things that are clearly within the rules. You'll have a

19 mature, reasonable discussion, and come to some agreement where
20 agreement can be had. When you have disputes that are good
21 faith and reasonable and based on available interpretations of
22 the law, you'll submit to me in writing and I'll be happy to
23 resolve it.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: That's totally fine, your Honor. I
25 guess the problem is -- and this is where we're going to end
