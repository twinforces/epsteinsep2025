preclude evidence or argument sounding in nullificdtion. I

agree with the defense that there is no need for me to rule on
this preséntly. I trust that. defense counsel khows wéll the
clear rules around any such arguments so it is a bit hard to
think about what guidance I can offer here.

Ms. Moe, is there a specific concern ‘you want to
raise?

MS, MOE: Thank you, ‘your Honor.

Asidé from the exanples we proffered ih dur motidn,
there is nothing in parnticular that this motion 1s aimed at and,
so I don't. think anything more along those lines to address
today .

MS; STERNHEIM: Nothing at this tiie.

THE COURT: OK, So nothang referenced, with respect, to
the government.'S Concerns about nullification would be
implicated in the anticipated opening?

MS. STERNHEIM: That is correct.
