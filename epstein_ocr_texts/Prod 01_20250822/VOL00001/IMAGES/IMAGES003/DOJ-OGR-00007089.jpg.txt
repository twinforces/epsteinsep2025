1 THE COURT: From your perspective, anything further

2 that could be addressed at this time or needs to be addressed?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: On this topic your Honor?

4 THE COURT: Yes.

5 MR. PAGLIUCA: No.

6 THE COURT: Ms. Moe?

7 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.

8 THE COURT: The next is government 9 which is to

9 preclude evidence or argument sounding in nullification. I

10 agree with the defense that there is no need for me to rule on
11 this presently. I trust that defense counsel knows well the

12 clear rules around any such arguments so it is a bit hard to

13 think about what guidance I can offer here.

14 Ms. Moe, is there a specific concern you want to

15 raise?

16 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

17 Aside from the examples we proffered in our motion,

18 there is nothing in particular that this motion is aimed at and
19 so I don't think anything more along those lines to address
20 today.
21 MS. STERNHEIM: Nothing at this time.
22 THE COURT: OK. So nothing referenced with respect to
23 the government's concerns about nullification would be
24 implicated in the anticipated opening?
25 MS. STERNHEIM: That is correct.
