Instruction No. 30: Counts Two, Four, and Six: Aiding and.Abetting
‘In‘connection with the crimes charged. in ‘Counts Two, Four, and Six, the Defendant is
also charged with aiding’ and abetting the commission, of those crimes.. Aiding’ and abetting
liability is its own theory of criminal. liability. In effect, itis a theory of liability that:permits.a
defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself committing the
crime, assisted another person or'persons in. committing the crime. As-to Counts Two, Four, and
Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if: she committed the crime herself, or if

another person committed the. crime:and the ‘Defendant. aided and abetted that person to. commit.

‘that crime.

Under the federal. aiding and abetting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,

induces,, or procures” the commission. of an offense. is punishable as. a principal. You:should give

‘those words their ordinary meaning. A person. aids or abets.a.crime if she: knowingly does some:

act-for'the' purpose of aiding or encouraging the: commission of that crime, with, the intention. of
Causing the crime charged. to be committéd. To “counsel” means to give advice orrécommend.
To “induce” means ‘to lead or move by: persuasion or influence as to some action. or'state of

mind. ‘Lo. “procure” means to bring about by unscrupulous, or indirect means. To “cause” means,

‘to bring something about, to. éffect something..

‘In other words, it is not-necessary for the Government to show that Ms. Maxwell herself

‘physically committed the crime charged in order for'you'to find her guilty., This is because a.

‘person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a:crime is:

just ‘as guilty of that offense as.if she committed it herself. Accordingly; you may. find Ms.
Maxwell guilty ofthe offenses chargéd in Counts Two, Four, and Six if'you find beyond a

reasonable doubt that the Government has proven-that another person actually committed the
