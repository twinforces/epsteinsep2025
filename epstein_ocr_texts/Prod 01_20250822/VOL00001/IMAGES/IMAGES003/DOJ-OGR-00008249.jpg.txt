1 we're also handing out the names that correspond to the juror

2 numbers, approximately 24 hours in advance of when voir dire

3 even begins. My experience is attorneys get that list

4 simultaneous with the beginning of voir dire. Here you get it
a) 24 hours in advance, and of course two weeks before the

6 exercise of peremptories.

7 So, we'll mark the juror number list that we've agreed
8 that we are calling back as a court exhibit, we'll call that

9 Court Exhibit 1 and mark it.

10 Let me ask counsel if you have any questions about

11 what I've just described.

12 MS. COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor.

13 Thank you.

14 MS. MENNINGER: Not for us, your Honor. Thank you.

15 THE COURT: Very well.

16 Moving to the specific logistics of voir dire. We'll
17 meet at 8:30 each day beginning tomorrow in this courtroom,

18 518. As I explained when we first began discussing this at the
19 October 21 conference, each panel of jurors will be held ina
20 separate courtroom. They will watch the video remarks that I
21 shared with you and we agreed upon and I recorded the video.
22 They'll be shown those video remarks, and then they will be
23 brought in here one at a time. And my hope is that we can get
24 the jurors, the morning panel jurors checked in and ready to go
25 so we can start at 9 a.m. with the first jurors.
