we're also handing out thé naémés that correspond to the jtiror
numbers, approximately 24 hours in. advance of when. voir dire
even begins. My experience is attorneys gét that list

simultaneous with the beginning of voir dire. Here you get it

24 hours in advance, and of coursé ‘two weeks before the
exercise of peremptories,

So, we'll mark the Juror number list that we've agreed
that we are calling back as a court exhibit, we'll call that
Court Exhibit 1 and mark vt.

Let me ask counsel if you have any questions. about
what I've just, described.

MS. COMEY: Not, fuom the government, ‘your Honor.

Thank ‘you.
MS. MENNINGER: Not. for us, your Honor. Thank you.

THE GOURT: Very well.

iF?

Moving to the specific logistics of voir dire. We'l.

meet. at 8:30 each day beginhing to6morrow in this Courtroom,
S18. As I explained when we first began discussing this at the

October 21 conference, each panel of jurors will be héld in a

I

separate courtroom. They will watch the video remarks that

shared with yoéu and we agreed upon and I recorded thé video.

They" Ll be shown those video remarks, and then, they will be
brought in here one at a titie. And my hope is that we can get
the jurors, the morning panel jurors checked in and ready to go
so we can start at 9 a.m. with the first jurors.
