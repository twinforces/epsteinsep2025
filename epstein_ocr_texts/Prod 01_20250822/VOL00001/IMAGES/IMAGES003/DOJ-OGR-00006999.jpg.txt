1 on the docket as litigation in advance of trial continues.

2 For these reasons, I deny the defendant's request to
3 seal the proposed voir dire and questionnaire. They should be
4 docketed by the end of the week, and my chambers will do the

a same with my draft as well.

6 All right. With that resolved, I would like to turn
7 to the specifics of my draft and hear, with the background now
8 of how we'll proceed and opportunity to have reviewed those

9 drafts in advance, if there are issues to raise, specific

10 objections to my draft questionnaire and voir dire, which I

11 transmitted to the parties yesterday.

12 Ms. Pomerantz.

13 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.

14 The government has no objection to the Court's draft
15 questionnaire and voir dire.

16 THE COURT: OK.

17 Ms. Sternheim.

18 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes, Judge.

19 Although we would have preferred a more fulsome
20 questionnaire, containing a larger percentage of the questions
21 that we requested, we do have a few requests that we would ask
22 the Court to consider.
23 THE COURT: OK.
24 MS. STERNHEIM: And if you'd just give me a moment so
25 that I can get that document?
