The government did not confer with defense counsel before filing its motion. Had it done
so, the government would have learned that of these four categories, Ms. Maxwell intends only
to elicit testimony about the third. As to that category of testimony, the government’s argument
borders on the frivolous.

While talking with Mr. Hamilton about Mr. Epstein in 2019 or 2020, Kate made two
statements laying bare her motive and bias. i
eee
eS
ee hc law is clear that
Ms. Maxwell can ask Mr. Hamilton about these statements.

“The law is well settled in this Circuit, as in others, that bias of a witness is not a
collateral issue and extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove that a witness has a motive to testify
falsely.” United States v. Harvey, 547 F.2d 720, 722 (2d Cir. 1976) (citing cases). And “[t]he law
of evidence has long recognized that a cross-examiner is not required to ‘take the answer’ of a
witness concerning possible bias, but may proffer extrinsic evidence, including the testimony of
other witnesses, to prove the facts showing a bias in favor of or against a party.” /d. (quoting
McCormick, Evidence, § 41 (2d Ed. 1972)) (emphasis added). Indeed, “Special treatment is
accorded evidence which is probative of a special motive to lie ‘for if believed it colors every bit
of testimony given by the witness whose motives are bared.’” /d. (quoting United States v.

' The government implies that it does not understand what this statement means. Gov.
Letter, p 9. The meaning, however, is self-evident. And the government’s inability to understand
the statement goes to weight, not admissibility. The government is free to argue to the jury that
Kate’s statement is ambiguous or meaningless.
