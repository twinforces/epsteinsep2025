1 A. Again, it's highly, high consistent, in both my criminal

2 and civil, civil practices. Even if I'm not -—- even if the

3 issues specific to the sexual abuse are not the issue at hand,
4 certainly when I'm doing a comprehensive evaluation, I'm taking
5 a history and people are describing their prior experiences,

6 the kinds of experiences they talk about in the context of

7 having experienced childhood sexual abuse, the relationship

8 they've had with the perpetrator, the kinds of things that the
9 perpetrator has done to kind of engage them into that

10 relationship for the purposes of sexual abuse are very

11 consistent.

12 Q. Is there empirical data to support your view that certain
13 groups of children are at higher risk of being sexually abused?
14 A. There is.

15 Q. Can you explain?

16 A. Sure. When we're studying any phenomenon, I want to look
17 at the prevalence, which is, you know, how often does this

18 thing, in this case child sexual abuse, occur. We can never

19 have a perfect understanding, because some people will deny,
20 you know, not everybody will report. But to the degree that we
21 can look at national samples and, you know, on average how
22 often does this occur in a national sample and then how
23 often -- what is the rate of occurrence in other subgroups, so,
24 you know, is the rate of sexual abuse higher, for example, from
25 a prevalence perspective, in some marginalized individuals.
