credibility will be the central question for the jury in this case.” (Dkt. No. 291 at 12). From the
face of the expert notice, it appears that few if any of the defendant’s eight experts would offer
testimony whose relevance only became apparent after the Government’s production of Jencks
Act material and its exhibit list, and it is unlikely that these eight experts were all retained in the
last two weeks. The Government should not now be prejudiced by the defendant’s apparent
gamesmanship in seeking an unnecessarily cramped disclosure schedule. Accordingly, for these
six experts, the Government proposes to submit any Daubert briefing on November 23, with
defense responses due November 30.

Defense Position

Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court hold the hearing on November 10, 2021.

The Court gave the parties a simple directive which was to confer and pick a date for the
Daubert and Rule 412 hearing, the options being November 5, 9, or 10. Defense counsel attempted
this conferral and sent an email to the government stating, in relevant part:

[W]e are free for the Rule 412/Daubert hearing on Nov. 9 or 10 but have a
preference for Nov. 10. Please advise what the government’s preference is.

I believe the Court requested that we give our preference about the date of the Rule
412/Daubert hearing in a joint letter to the Court filed on ECF. I think we could
include our positions on the trial length in that letter as well. Please let me know if
you will draft the letter or if you would like the defense to draft it.

The government’s non-response to this straightforward conferral was: “On the timing
of the 412/Daubert hearing, we’re preparing a draft letter which we’ll send you shortly.”
Instead of conferring with defense counsel the government at, 7:07 p.m., sent its two
sentence non-conferral:

On the other issue, scheduling the Daubert/412 hearing, attached is a draft letter,
along with our proposed redactions to your expert notice. Please feel free to insert
your position, which we ask that you do by 9:00.
