1 irrelevant to the crimes charged, correct? Under the age of 17
2 is what is legally relevant.

3 MS. MOE: That's certainly true with respect to the

4 elements as to the other victims, but I think as a matter of

5 common sense, a jury understanding that the defendant is

6 willing to provide Epstein with a girl at the age of 17 would

7 certainly speak to her knowledge of his sexual preferences.

8 THE COURT: Why doesn't it speak to a knowledge of

9 sexual preferences to someone just above the age of consent?

10 MS. MOE: Well, your Honor, I think the close

11 proximity of ages, it speaks to her knowledge about his

12 preference for very young girls.

13 I would also note that, although the age of 17 is

14 relevant with respect to the Mann Act counts, with respect to
15 the trafficking counts, the applicable age is there is 18.

16 THE COURT: I began this whole series by asking, like
17 eight times and very clearly, is there any sense in which this
18 individual, the conduct that's -- assuming it to all be true

19 with respect to this individual, could establish an element of
20 any of the crimes charged?
21 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. With respect to that
22 victim, that's certainly the case. But speaking to direct
23 evidence of knowledge and preferences, it's certainly also
24 direct evidence of the defendant's knowledge with respect to
25 the sex trafficking counts where the age of consent there is
