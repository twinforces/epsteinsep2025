I. THIS COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF ALLEGED:CO-

CONSPIRATOR STATEMENTS AS A. SANCTION FOR GOVERNMENT'S __

The government offers, several excuses for its failure to comply with, this Court’s
September 3, 2021 Order. These excuses are insufficient :and should be rejected.

A; The Court’s Order was Neither Ambiguous Nor Misread by the Defense

First, the government suggests that. Ms., Maxwell has misread the Order., We disagree.
The Court unambiguously rejected. the government’s position and ruled, that.the government’s

government'was required to “disclose to the defense the identitics of any-unnamed co-
conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged. in the S2 indictment,to whom
the government will refer'at trial?’ Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and ¢mphatically,
directed: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay
‘statements it intends to offer at trial no ‘later, than,October. 11, as consistent with;this Court’s
scheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at.1.” (emphasis in. original.)

The Court used the word “disclose” both, as to: the identity: of the co-conspirators “to
whom the government will refer'to at trial” and “a// co-conspirator hearsay. statements it intends
to offcr-at:trial.....°> The: government, in an attempt to blunt the Order, decided. to interpret the
same word, “disclose” in materially distinct fashions. As to the identity of the co-conspirators,

the government disclosed. (7.¢., identified) three names. When. it, was parsing the second part of
