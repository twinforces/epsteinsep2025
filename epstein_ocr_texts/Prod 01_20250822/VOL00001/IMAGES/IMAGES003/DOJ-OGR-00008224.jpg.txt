Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document524 Filed 12/05/21 Page2of2
Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court inform the jury that the
Government and Witness-3 are simply following the Court’s instructions. The Government
proposes the following addition to the limiting instruction the Court is already planning to give
before Witness-3 testifies.
You will hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she says she
had with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was
over the relevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any sexual conduct she
says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity” as the Government
has charged in the Indictment. For that reason, I have directed the parties not to
ask Witness-3 about the details of any sexual conduct she says occurred with
Mr. Epstein. | instruct you that this witness is not a victim of the crimes charged
in the Indictment. To the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the
issues before you, you may consider it. However, you may not convict the
Defendant on the basis of the testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this
witness and Mr. Epstein. Nor may you consider this testimony as any kind of
reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor Ms. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit
any of the crimes charged in the Indictment.
This addition to the proposed instruction is neutral but mitigates the risk of prejudice to the
Government.
Respectfully submitted,
