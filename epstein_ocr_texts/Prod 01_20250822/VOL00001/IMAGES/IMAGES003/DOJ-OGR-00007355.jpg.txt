* Onsite support, maintenance and other measures are provided to ensure

the highest levels of security and reliability.

* The network is totally separate from the court’s internal network; it is

therefore physically impossible for information on the court’s existing systems

to be accessed or compromised.

Courtroom Connect will make all necessary arrangements with the Court’s District
Executive office and computer networking personnel.
If the Court is agreeable to these arrangements, the Government respectfully requests
that the Court enter the enclosed proposed order permitting the parties to proceed.
Respectfully submitted,
DAMIAN WILLIAMS
United States Attorney
