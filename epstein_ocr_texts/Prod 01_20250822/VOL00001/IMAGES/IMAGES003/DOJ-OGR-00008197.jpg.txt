Ms. Maxwell does not have disclose any “books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible
objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these items” she does not intend to
use in her “case-in-chief.”

The government is doubly wrong to say that impeachment evidence is limited to
inconsistent statements. Ms. Maxwell can impeach a prosecution witness’s testimony with any
admissible exhibit. The decision in United States v. Hatfield makes this clear.

In Hatfield, the government sought a Rule 16(b)(1)(A) order compelling the defendant to
disclose six categories of evidence:

(1) the Tactical Armor Products, Inc. computers and servers, as described in the

testimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2008; (2) all computers of DHB Industries, Inc.,

as described in the testimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2008; (3) all computers

personally used by and/or issued to David H. Brooks; (4) all Toshiba laptops issued

by DHB to Dawn Schlegel; (5) the stationery books obtained by David Brooks from

the “Joon” stationary store; and (6) the binder prepared by Caroline Pang containing

2003 Monthly Point Blank Body Armor (“PBBA”) inventory reports.

United States v. Hatfield, No. 06-CR-0550, 2009 WL 10673619, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2009).
The district court refused the government’s request, as should this Court. As Judge Seybert
explained:

Because [the defendant] will not be using these items to support his case in chief,

[he] is not required to disclose the items under Rule 16....

The Court rejects the Government’s argument that [the defendant] is
required to turn over the above documents pursuant to Rule 16 because [the
defendant] may use the items to impeach Government witnesses. Rule 16 mandates
disclosure of any documents and tangible objects that the defendant will use in his
case-in-chief, and not items which the defendant will use to impeach witnesses.
