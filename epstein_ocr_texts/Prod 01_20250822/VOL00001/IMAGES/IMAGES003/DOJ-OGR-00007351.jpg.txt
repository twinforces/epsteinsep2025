ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of the Government’s supplemental letter regarding Government
Exhibit 52, Dkt. No. 457, and the Defendant’s response, which has been temporarily filed under
seal to allow the parties the opportunity to request limited redactions. The Government is hereby
ORDERED to file a reply to Defendant’s response on or before 12:00 p.m. on November 21,
2021. The letter reply should address the Defendant’s argument that Employee-1 cannot
authenticate Government Exhibit 52 because Mr. Rodriguez, a former employee, purportedly
removed the document from the property before Employee-1 began working for Mr. Epstein.

The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to file any proposed redactions to the motion
papers on the public docket on or before November 22, 2021, justifying any requested redactions
by reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).

SO ORDERED.

Dated: November 19, 2021 A \) i
