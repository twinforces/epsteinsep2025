1 MS. MAYERS-BEST: Correct.
2 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you, Judge.
3 The other questions I can wait until the Court
4 addresses other protocol.
5 THE COURT: OK.
6 And let me just pause.
7 The next thing I wanted to talk to you about goes to
8 the exercise of peremptories and the number of qualified jurors
9 that I will, number of jurors I'll seek to qualify.
10 Once we get a sufficient number of qualified jurors
11 through the practice I've just described, the parties will
12 exercise their peremptories, of course, and what I'd like
13 counsels' input on at this time is a timing question. I've
14 thought a lot about this. I think we've got two potential
15 options as to timing of the exercise of peremptories, depending
16 on how quickly we move through the voir dire process and get a
17 sufficient number of qualified jurors.
18 If we use every day, including the 19th, then I think
19 we only have one option, but if we're done before that, which I
20 think there's a good chance of, then I think we have two
al options: either November 19 or November 29.
22 So let me just back up.
23 As a preliminary matter, by my count, I need to
24 qualify 40 jurors. Consistent with Rule 24 of the Federal
25 Rules of Criminal Procedure, 12 primary jurors, with respect to
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
