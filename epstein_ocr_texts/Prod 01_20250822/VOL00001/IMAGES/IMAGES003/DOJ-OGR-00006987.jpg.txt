through the practice I've just described, the parties will

exercise their peremptories, of course, and, what, I'd like

options as to timing of the exercise 6f peremptories, depending
on, how quickly we meve through the voin dine ‘process and get. a

options: either Névember 19 or Noveriber 29.

qualify 40 jurors. Consistent with Rule 24 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal. Procedure, 12 primary jurors, with respect to
