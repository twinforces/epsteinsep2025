This study is unusual insofar as the sample studied had reported their
experience of abuse to the authorities and a prosecution was in progress.
Goodman-Brown ef al. also pointed out that families who participated in this
study were more likely to represent those children who experienced abuse by
someone outside the family. Research has found that delays in disclosure are
longer for those abused within the family (Sjoberg and Lindblad, 2002;
Goodman-Brown ef al., 2003; Kogan, 2004; Hershkowitz et al., 2005).
Therefore, children who disclose more promptly may be overrepresented in
legal samples. ‘Children who disclose

mentioned a ‘friend of my own age’ as the only person who they had told. In
this study, 6.8 per cent had reported their experiences to the social authorities
or police. A further Swedish study of 122 women who had experienced
childhood sexual abuse (Jonson and Lindblad, 2004) found that 32 per cent
disclosed during childhood (before the age of 18) while the majority told in
adulthood (68%). The delay was up to 49 years, with an average of 21 years
(SD = 12.9). Of those who told in childhood, 59 per cent told only one person.
In Ireland, the SAVI study (n = 3118, McGee e¢ al., 2002) found that 47 per
cent of those respondents who had experienced some form of sexual assault
prior to age 17 had told no-one of this experience until the survey. McElvaney
(2002) investigated delay in a legal sample of ten adults who had made formal
complaints of childhood sexual abuse in Ireland and found delays ranging from

child has been sexually abused also point to high non-disclosure rates,
particularly striking in cases where there is corroborative evidence that
abuse has occurred — medical evidence (Lyon, 2007), or confessions from
the abuser or videotaped evidence/witness reports (Sjoberg and Lindblad,
2002). Lyon (2007) reported his findings from a review of studies
published between 1965 and 1993 of children diagnosed with gonorrhoea
where the average disclosure rate among 579 children was 43 per cent
(n = 250). Ina study where the evidence for the abuse was available on videotape,
children have denied abuse when interviewed by the police (Sjoberg and
Lindblad, 2002).
In summary, significant numbers of children do not disclose experiences of
sexual abuse until adulthood and adult survey results suggest that significant
