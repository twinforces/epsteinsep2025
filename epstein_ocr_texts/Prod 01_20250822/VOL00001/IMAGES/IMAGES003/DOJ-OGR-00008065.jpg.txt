experts, however, and before any testimony by the forensic document specialists, the defense must
say more about these witnesses’ opinions and the bases for them. The Government is not able to
take a position on the reliability or relevance of those opinions from the face of the expert notice.
Given the proximity to trial, any additional delay to provide sufficient notice should be closely
scrutinized by the Court, and entirely precluded if notice is not provided forthwith.

A. Robert Kelso and John Lopez
The defendant anticipates calling Robert Kelso, a computer forensics specialist, to testify
about:
the user data associated with certain devices seized and
searched by the government’s team in this case, documents
and photographs extracted from certain of those devices, and
the metadata associated with certain documents and
photographs. He may also testify generally about computer
forensic principles associated with the creation of documents,
storage and retrieval of digital documents and photographs,
including the limits to the information that can be gleaned
from the metadata. Mr. Kelso may testify in rebuttal to any
testimony offered by the government through Stephen Flatley.
As trial preparation proceeds, the defense will update the
topics for Mr. Kelso if any arise.
(Ex. A at 12-13).
Similarly, the defendant anticipates John Lopez, a financial investigator, to testify about:
his review of certain financial records provided by the
government in discovery. Specifically, Mr. Lopez will discuss
various transfers of funds that are reflected in the financial
records and explain the information contained in the financial
records regarding those transfers.
(Id. at 13).
To the extent Kelso and Lopez are expected to summarize evidence otherwise in the record,
that testimony is not expert testimony, and therefore its admission is not precluded by Rule 702.
