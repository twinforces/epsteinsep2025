LB1 5MAX2:

an, otit-of'-coltitt statement ‘you a@re putting on for the truth, it
is hearsay.

MS. MENNINGER: Slightly different, your Honor.

If a witness says they interviewed -- if a law

enforcement says they interviewed another accuser and ‘that
accuser never said that Ms. Maxwell was involved, that's not a
hedrsay' stdattement. They just didn't mention her, it is the

absence of a statement. -And as your Honor just ruled in terms

of the thorotighnéss of the investigation, if there is, évidence
that the government puts on about these other accusers I think.

that's whdt opens. the door. It 18 not us opening the door, it

would be them submittang evidence that other ‘people wene
victims without putting those people 6n,; putting 6n message
pads that had Eheim names on it, and then precluding us from
introducing evidence that. noné of those individuals implicated
Ms. Maxwell.

THE COURT: Right. So, if the gévernment doés that

you are mot precluded from putting other evidence on. The

question is what evidence would it be and would it be

admissible under the relevant mules of evidence. I am not sure

I can resolve that in the abstract. It séunds like neither

side intends to open with mespect ‘to this issue and, 1 think we

largély agree on the legal principles. Tell me if you need

more guidance for purposes of opening or preparing ‘your Case.
Ms. Menninger?
