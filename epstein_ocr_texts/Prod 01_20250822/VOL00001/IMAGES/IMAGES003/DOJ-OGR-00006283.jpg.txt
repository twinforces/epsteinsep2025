Pathways to False Allegations 109

to achieve power and pleasure, a false allegation of sexual assault might be

the means by which he or she attempts to achieve power over the falsely

accused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggres-

sive act fitting diagnostic criterion 4. Furthermore, a lack of remorse could

allow the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this

allegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false

allegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial

personality disorder makes a false claim of assault.

Antisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women
(Lamont & Brunero, 2009; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), with
prevalence rates of 3% and 1%, respectively, based on data from community
samples (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Though women are the
most frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also
report sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial
personality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-
sonality disorder to report having experienced sexual assault during their
lifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization
(Burnam et al., 1988).

Borderline Personality Disorder

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition charac-
terized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal
relationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,
Linehan, & Bohus, 2004). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community
and clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-
tion (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &
Severen, 2007; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2007),
and the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are
women (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).

The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) includes nine
diagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narrowed
down to four domains (Lieb et al., 2004). The first domain is affective distur-
bance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood
reactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three
levels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including
dissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to
this pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions
and hallucinations (further discussed below) that are somewhat reality-
based; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third
domain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-
ized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and
erratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid
either real or imagined abandonment.
