Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter motion to quash the defendant’s Rule
17(c)(3) subpoena to Jordana Feldman, the administrator of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation
Program (EVCP). For the reasons set forth below, the subpoena should be quashed. !

I. Applicable Law

As the defendant acknowledges, she bears the burden of satisfying the standard in United
States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974). (Def. Mot. at 1). Pursuant to that standard, the “party
seeking issuance of [a Rule 17(c)] subpoena must clear three hurdles: (1) relevancy; (2)
admissibility; (3) specificity.” United States v. Cole, 2021 WL 912425, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10,
2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). The proponent must also establish that the records
sought “are not otherwise procurable.” /d. (quoting Nixon, 418 U.S. at 699-700).

' For sake of simplicity, the Government uses the term “Minor Victims” to include Witness-3. The
Government acknowledges the Court’s order that Witness-3 should not be referenced at trial as a
victim.
