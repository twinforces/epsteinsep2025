Re: United. States'v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20'Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government writes regarding the two issues remaining following today’s charge
conference.

First, the Government. opposes the addition of Sand. instruction 7-12 regarding the
impeachment of. witnesses by fclony convictions. That: limiting instruction is meant to “tell the:
jury why the felony conviction, was put before them.” Sand Instr. 7-12 emt. Its useful in, cases
in'which,the:prior felony convictions are sufficiently significant'that'they ate an. important part of
the defense, and an, explanation, would aid the jury in, evaluating the evidence. In such,a case, it
aids the jury’to know that the prior conviction was offered solcly for the purpose of evaluating the

witness’ credibility. Here, the only witnesses whose prior convictions were clicited are Carolyn.
