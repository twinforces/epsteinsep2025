1 information including e-mails between the defendant and Jeffrey
2 Epstein. It is difficult for the government to determine in

3 the abstract what the defense might point to, but that night

4 include, for example, a false exculpatory statement. And so

5 the government's view is unless and until there is a proffer

6 from the defense about a specific statement, that the defense

7 should be precluded from offering a statement along those lines
8 in opening statements or otherwise.

9 THE COURT: Who is taking this one?

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, good morning. Jeffrey

11 Pagliuca for Ms. Maxwell.

12 Your Honor, this is a trial time decision. It depends
13 on what witness is testifying and whether or not there is a

14 relevant exception to the hearsay rule. I mean, we understand
15 the rules, we will follow the rules, and if the witness

16 testifies and it becomes relevant, we will ask the question.

17 If there is an objection, the Court will resolve the objection.
18 THE COURT: And you understand you are going to be

19 restrained by what one might say is an asymmetry between the
20 government's ability to use out-of-court statements by the
21 defendant and the defense's inability to do that, absent some
22 other -â€”
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Absolutely, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: OK.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: We understand the hearsay rules.
