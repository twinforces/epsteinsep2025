Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document398 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page11of52

D. There are Substantial Issues with the Government’s Anticipated Position

For a statement to fall within the definition of Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), “‘a court must
find (1) that there was a conspiracy, (2) that its members included the declarant and the party
against whom the statement is offered, and (3) that the statement was made both (a) during the
course of and (b) in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1196
(2d Cir. 1993). A cursory review of the discovery produced related to one purported co-
conspirator demonstrates the folly of proceeding as the government persists.

The government failed to follow the Court’s Order and fails to explain why it did not
disclose the statements as ordered. Accordingly, the Court should prohibit introduction of any
alleged co-conspirator statements at trial.
