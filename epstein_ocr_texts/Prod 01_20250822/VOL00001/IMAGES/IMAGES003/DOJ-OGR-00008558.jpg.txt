Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563_ Filed 12/18/21 Page 20 of 167
1 Instruction No. 11: Multiple Counts
Zz As I just explained, the Indictment contains six counts. Each count charges the-
3 DefendantMs. Maxwell with a different crime. You must consider each count separately and
4 return a separate verdict of guilty or not guilty for each. Whether you find Ms. Maxwell guilty
5 or not guilty as to one offense should not affect your verdict as to any other offense charged,
6 unless you are instructed otherwise.
7 You may only find Ms. Maxwell guilty of a particular count if the Government has
8 proven each element of the offense charged with respect to that count beyond a reasonable doubt.
