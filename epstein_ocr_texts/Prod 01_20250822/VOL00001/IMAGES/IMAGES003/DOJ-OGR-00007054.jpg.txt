1 Counsel, I'm prepared to turn to the motions first,

2 unless there's any reason to deviate from that.

3 Ms. Moe?

4 MS. MOE: No, your Honor, thank you.

5 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

6 MS. STERNHEIM: Not at this time, Judge.

7 THE COURT: All right. I am in receipt of the

8 parties' various motions in limine, responses in opposition,

9 and replies in support. I did require the parties to file the
10 papers on the public docket with their proposed redactions so
11 that the public could have immediate access to the documents.
12 T'll rule on the proposed redactions as quickly as I
13 can, including some that I will discuss today, but we will use
14 the same process going forward so as not to delay public access
15 to the bulk of materials related to pretrial filings. And I
16 thank counsel for that, as well as the submission to me of the
17 unredacted versions with the color coding indicating requested
18 redactions.

19 The government filed 11 motions in limine and the
20 defense 13, so there's a lot of ground to cover. I am prepared
21 to discuss all the motions now with the exception of the
22 Daubert motion. As I indicated in an order that was docketed
23 this morning, I will hold a Daubert hearing before resolving
24 that motion.
25 As to the rest, some I want to hear further from the
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
