prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and-will mislead the jury into. believing’ that the: alleged scx acts
between Epstein and.Accuser-3 were unlawful:*

The Second Circuit takes an “inclusionary approach” to: Rule 404(b) evidence, which
admits “other act” evidence “that, docs not serve the sole purpose of showing the defendant’s bad
character and that is neither overly prejudicial under Rule 403 nor itrelevant under Rule 402.
Curley, 639 F.3d at 56 (citing United States v. Pascarella, 84 F 34.61, 69 (2d Cir. 1996)). The
inclusionary approach, however, docs not permit the government “to offer, carte blanche, any
prior act of'the.defendant in.the:same category: of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d.at475

(quoting United States v. Garcia, 291 F.3d.127, 137 (2d, Cir.2002)). If other act evidence is

offered for'the: purpose of establishing the defendant*s knowledge or intent, the government must
“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant. to:
establishing: knowledge of the current act.” Jd. (quoting Gareia,.291 F.3d at 137),

The government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuscr-3 is admissible under
Rule:404(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell's knowledge, intent, and modus: operandi. See Gov’t Mem.
in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt.. 204) at 167. This. argument is‘unavailing. Accuser-3’s
evidence could-not possibly’ be: proof that Ms. Maxwell. knew of Epstcin’s “attraction. to. minor
girls” and knew that Epstein ‘uscd massage to. initiate: sexual contact “with minor girls” because:
Accuser-3 was nota, minor when the alleged sex acts took place. Jd. For the same: reason,
Accuser-3’s evidence. could not possibly. be proof that Ms. Maxwell. “intended. for minor girls to:

engage ‘in sex, acts with Epstein.” Jd.

8 Asnoted.in.Ms. Maxwell's: Motion in.Limine to-Exclude the Government’s Rule 404(b) Evidence, the government
did not give:proper 404(b):notice: with respect to.any-of its proposed-404(b) evidence, which includes. Accuser-3’s
‘ewidence. Nevertheless, wetrespond-on the’merits to the admissibility. of Accuser-3"s evidence under-Rule.404(b)-in
the event’ the Court.determines that the: government's ‘additional.disclosures concerning; Accuser-3' incits
Memorandum in-Opposition to Defendant's Pretrial Motions ‘are sufficient to'satisfyits:notice obligations under’
Rule 404(b). See Gov't Mem. in Opp.to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 204).at 157-169.
