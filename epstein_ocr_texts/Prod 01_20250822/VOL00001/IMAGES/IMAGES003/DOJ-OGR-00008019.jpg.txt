LBAAMAX5ps Rocchio - Cross

1 THE COURT: OK.

2 BY MR. PAGLIUCA:

3 Q. We're going down to the bottom of page 5.

4 A. Yes.

S Actually, you know what, it's on my screen properly

6 now, so it's going to be easier for me to look there, because

7 it's bigger.

8 OK.

9 Q. So I want to just highlight here one of the problems with
10 these studies that you're relying on is, we've got a comment,
11 "Two-thirds of the sample did not disclose right away." But we
12 don't define what "right away" means, do we?

13 A. So to be clear, the article that I submitted was a summary
14 of the literature. I'm not saying that I have read and
15 examined every study cited in this particular article. Sol
16 really can't speak as to how those in this article identified
17 or defined "rate of disclosure." I would expect, however, that
18 it would be defined in the full article itself. It's not
19 defined here in the brief summary. But typically in scientific
20 literature, it would -- the time period of disclosure that the
21 authors were investigating, I would expect to find that in the
22 article itself.
23 Q. OK. But apparently you haven't gone back to look at the
24 underlying data. Is that right?
25 A. I have not gone back to look at every reference cited in
