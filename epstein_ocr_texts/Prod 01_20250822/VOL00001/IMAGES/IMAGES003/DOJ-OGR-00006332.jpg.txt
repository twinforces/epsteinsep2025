Space will be available in the courtroom proper for members of the media. In order to comply
with the District’s COVID-19 protocols, the public and additional members of the media will be
able to access the proceeding in overflow Courtrooms 506 and 905 of the Thurgood Marshall
U.S. Courthouse. These overflow rooms will have live video and audio feeds of the proceeding.
The use of any electronic devices during the proceeding in the overflow rooms is strictly
prohibited.

The Court anticipates seating capacity in the overflow rooms for 50 members of the
public. If capacity is reached, no additional persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response
to COVID-19, anyone who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire
on the date of the proceeding prior to entering the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Only persons who meet the entry
requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees
will be allowed to enter the courthouse. All visitors must wear a mask that covers the person’s
nose and mouth. Bandannas, gaiters, and masks with valves are not permitted. If a person does
not have an approved mask, a screener will provide one. Anyone who fails to comply with the
COVID-19 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the
courthouse. There are no exceptions. For more information, please see
