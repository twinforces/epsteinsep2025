Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563 _ Filed 12/18/21 Page 47 of 167
1 Instruction No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —
2 First Element: Object of the Conspiracy
3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy from at least in or
4 about 1994, up to and including in or about 2004, to entice individuals under the age of 17
5 miners-to travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a
6 criminal offense. The object of the conspiracy charged in Count One of the Indictment is to
| 7 entice individuals under the age of 17 miners-to travel to engage in sexual activity for which
8 any person can be charged with a criminal offense. I have already reviewed the elements of
9 that offense in connection with Count Two. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the
10 Defendant agreed with at least one other person that those elements be done, then the
| 11. enticement of individuals under the age of 17 miners-to travel to engage in sexual activity for
12 which any person can be charged with a criminal offense objective would be proved.
13 Count Three charges the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy, from at least in
14 or about 1994, up to and including in or about 2004, to transport individuals under the age of
1517 mainers-with the intent to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged
16 witha criminal offense. The object of the conspiracy charged in Count Three of the
| 17 Indictment is to transport individuals under the age of 17 miners-with the intent to engage in
18 — sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. I have already
19 reviewed the elements of that offense in connection with Count Four. If you find beyond a
20 reasonable doubt that the Defendant agreed with at least one other person that those elements
| 21 be done, then the transportation of individuals under the age of 17 miners-with the intent to
22 engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense
23 objective would be proved.
