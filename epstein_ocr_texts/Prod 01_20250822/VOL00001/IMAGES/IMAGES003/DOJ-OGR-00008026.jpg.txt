MR. PAGLIUCA: Yés, your Honor.

THE COURT: And then. do you intend to :mpeach any
witnesses baséd on, Substance abuse?

MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.

THE COURT: OKs All right. I think I have what I
need,

I'm going to give the reasons for my opinion, I think,
probably, at our proceeding on, Monday, but what L intend to do.
18 deny thé Daubert métion except with respect to the opinion
that expresses that the presence of another individual can,
facilitate sexual abuse of minors: But otherwise thé motion
will be denied. And as I, said, I'll give my reasons for the
denial and thé reason for the partial grant on Monday.

OK, I think with that we can, transition ‘to the 412
proceeding. So we'll break f6r ten minutes. We will, as I
said, have to seal the courtroom, as requimned by the rule,
which will medn all nine party participants have to leave and
the live feed will have to be ‘turn, off. And we'll confirm in
the overflow rooms that those are off.

Sq we'll break fon ten. Thank you.
