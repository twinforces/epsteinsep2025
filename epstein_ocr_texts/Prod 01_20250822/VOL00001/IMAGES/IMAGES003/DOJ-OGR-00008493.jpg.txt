Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document562 Filed 12/17/21 Page 37 of 82

1 Instruction No. 29: Count Six: Sex Trafficking of a Minor — Fourth Element

2 The fourth and final element of Count Six which the Government must prove beyond a

3 reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell’s conduct was in interstate commerce or affected interstate

4 commerce.

5 Interstate commerce simply means the movement of goods, services, money and

6 individuals between any two or more states.

7 I instruct you that acts and transactions that cross state lines, or which affect the flow of

8 money in the stream of commerce to any degree, however minimal, are acts and transactions

9 affecting interstate commerce. For instance, it affects interstate commerce to use products that
10 traveled in interstate commerce.
11 It is not necessary for the Government to prove that Ms. Maxwell specifically knew or
12 intended that her conduct would affect interstate commerce; it is only necessary that the natural
13. consequences of such conduct would affect interstate commerce in some way, even if minor.
14 If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the recruitment, enticement, harboring,
15 transportation, providing, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex
16 acts was economic in nature and involved the crossing of state lines, or was economic in nature
17 and otherwise affected the flow of money to any degree, however minimal, you may find that the
18 interstate commerce requirement of the offense of sex trafficking of a minor has been satisfied.
19 I further instruct you that to find that this element has been proven beyond a reasonable
20 doubt, it is not necessary for you to find that any interstate travel occurred. Proof of actual travel
21 is not required.
