1 Instruction No. 54: Persons Not on Trial
2 You may not draw any inference, favorable or unfavorable, towards the Government or
3 the defendant on trial from the fact that any person in addition to the defendant is not on trial
4 here. You also may not speculate as to the reasons why other persons are not on trial. Those
5 matters are wholly outside your concern and have no bearing on your function as jurors in
6 deciding the case before you.
