important that you go straight to the jury room when you come inin the ‘morning
and that you remain in the jury room for the duration of the trial day. You.should

not linger in the public areas of the courthouse, on this floor or elsewhere on your

way: in and out.

anyone who has anything to with the case on your own. Don’t go visit any place

because your decision ‘in, this case must be made: solely on the evidence or lack. of

evidence presented at the trial. In other words, all. that you need to know will be
