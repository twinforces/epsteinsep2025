Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter moving to admit photographs from the
interior of Jeffrey Epstein’s house in New York. As explained below, particular images are
corroborative of testimony by the witness using the pseudonym “Jane.” They are therefore
relevant to the issues before the Court.!

1. Applicable Law

Evidence is relevant if “it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it
would be without the evidence,” and the fact “is of consequence in determining the action.” Fed.
R. Evid. 401; see Fed. R. Evid. 402 (“Relevant evidence is unless [another law] provides otherwise
' The Government has redacted the exhibits from this letter entirely to avoid publicizing
photographs which may not be exhibits at trial. The Government is prepared to file publicly a
version that contains redacted versions of the exhibits if the Court so orders.
