that is specifically charged in the indictment” or that is the subject of the relevant trial. Gigante,
166 F.3d at 82; see also Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 962 (“Though . . . Fed. R. Evid.
801(d)(2)(E) requires proof that both the declarant and the party against whom a declaration is
offered be members of the same conspiracy, it does not require that the conspiracy be one charged
in the indictment.”). Employee-1’s testimony regarding the continuing conspiracy thus satisfies
Rule 801(d)(2)(E)’s first prong.

When making this statement, Epstein was attempting to induce Employee-1’s cooperation
to effect the conspiracy’s goals. See, e.g., United States v. Gupta, 747 F.3d 111, 125 (2d Cir. 2014)
(“Statements designed to induce the listener’s assistance with respect to the conspiracy’s goals
satisfy the Rule’s in-furtherance requirement.”). Here, Epstein’s statement to Employee-1 was
intended to convey to Employee-1 that other employees had participated in the conspiracy to traffic
minors and to encourage Employee-1 to similarly participate. See United States v. Beech-Nut
Nutrition Corp., 871 F.2d 1181, 1199 (2d Cir. 1989) (“Coconspirator statements may be found to
be ‘in furtherance’ of the conspiracy within the meaning of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) if they ‘prompt the
listener to respond in a way that facilitates the carrying out of criminal activity.’” (quoting Kahme,
813 F.2d at 35)). Epstein’s statement reassured Employee-1 that Employee-1 would not be alone
among his employees by participating in his scheme and informed Employee-1 about the history
of the conspiracy. Further, Epstein’s statement conveyed to Employee-1 that the defendant was
someone who had participated in the scheme and accordingly could be trusted. See Simmons, 923
F.2d at 945 (statements between co-conspirators that “provide reassurance, serve to maintain trust
and cohesiveness among them, or inform each other of the current status of the conspiracy,” further
the conspiracy); see also United States v. Handy, 668 F.2d 407, 408 (8th Cir. 1982) (statement of
