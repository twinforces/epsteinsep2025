1 substantially confuse and delay the trial. The evidence

2 outlined in the defense's papers, including who was interviewed
3 and when, what documents were subpoenaed and other details of

4 investigations in two different states and different time

5 periods would substantially expand the scope of the trial.

6 Exactly what steps investigators took is not a simple question,
7 of course. The government would likely present a contrary

8 account of events, leading to trials within trials on what law
9 enforcement did over the course of years. This prejudice would
10 substantially outweigh any minimum probative value that might
11 be gained from such a far-flung endeavor.

12 Third, as to prejudice, the evidence would be

13 cumulative, demonstrating that an investigation was "hasty" and
14 not thorough is at best repetitive of the defense's arguments
15 that the government collected insufficient evidence of guilt.
16 That point is made most clearly and directly by focusing on the
17 evidence or lack of evidence and credibility or lack of

18 credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.

19 The second piece of guidance I can provide now is that
20 the Court will exclude much of the evidence outlined in the
al defense's papers of the government's alleged motives for
22 investigating and charging Ms. Maxwell. This evidence includes
23 but is not limited to the Miami Herald article, statements from
24 Attorney General William Barr and the like.
25 The evidence presented by the government in this trial
