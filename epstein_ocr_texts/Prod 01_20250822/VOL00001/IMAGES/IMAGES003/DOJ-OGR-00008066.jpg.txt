See United States v. Lebedev, 932. F.3d 40, 50 (2d. Cir. 2019) (concluding that “an account. and.
litigation. consultant” who “summarfized] .. . the relevant, financial records” was not.an. expert.
witness). The Government has similarly provided expert notice inan.abundance of caution for
Stephen Flatley, an, FBI computer forensic examiner who will testify asa, faet witness about his
extraction. of devices scized pursuant to court authorized scarch ‘warrants and evidenée recovered
from those-devices: ''

To the extent; Kelso ‘and Lopez would testify based. on their “scientific, technical, or other
specialized. knowledge,” however, that testimony: is expert testimony. ./d. (quoting Fed. R.-Evid.
702(a)). And any. such testimony is not:reflected inthe expert:notice. These expert notices provide
lists of “general and. iti some cases extremely broad topics,” which ‘is “plainly inadequate” ‘under
Rule.l6. Whricht, 858 F.3d at 115. For instance, the notice for Kelso states that he will testify
“generally about computer forensic principles associated with. the:creation of documents,” and.
testify “about user data associated with certain. devices seized and scarched by the government’s
team in, this case.” (Ex.,A,at 12). It also states that the defense may “update the fupics for Mr.
Kelso” before trial. (/d. at. 13.\(emphasis added)). Similarly, Lopez will “discuss ‘various transfers
of funds that. are reflected in the financial :records and explain the :information, contained :in the:
financial:records.” (/d.). These lists of fopics-do not:permit the Government to identify Kelso and.
Lopez’s opinions, determine whether the proffered experts are in fact expert on those subjects, and.

litigate the reliability and relevance of those opinions.

ll. The Government also pointed to four other cases in:this’ District aid the Easter District in Which.
Flatley: testified, including United States v. Kelly,.19 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.).
