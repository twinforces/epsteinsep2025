Re: US. v. Maxwell, 20-cr-330 (AJN), second. timely opposition. tosealing and
withholding portions of motions in. limine, trial exhibits, public access, docketing
Dear Judge. Nathan:

On behalf of Ifner City Press and in my personal capacity, I have been covering
the above-captioned case. This coricertis today's flurry of motions in limine, still
replete with redactions..

This is a Press request that the filings be further unsealed consistent.with, Lugosch
v. Pyramid:Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 11.0 (2d Cir. 2006) and other applicable
case law. This is ‘a request that this opposition to sealing be docketed.as, for
example, took place in US v. Avenatti, 19-cr-374 (JMF), Dkt 85, see
https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.5.16151/gov.uscourts.nys

The Government's Justifications for redaction. (Docket No. 399, docketed at.1:0:06:
pm on Friday Oct 29) cites Lugosch. then says "The Government also seeks sealing
of trial exhibits, which are not public." Inner City Press immediately opposed this.

While as one example within the US motions of limine, the Government has now:
redacted. the title of its. Argument.X, footnote 13 and many other phrases are still.
redacted, as are significant portions ofits Exhibit A. Dkt 438 and 438-1.

Worse, the Defendant's response to the US motions in limine has large portions,
of its table of contents redacted (for example Argument I, A 1,2 and 3; C 1 and 2,
and_.D).

A. full.sentence argument in Defendant's submission opposing Doctor Rocchio,
who testified earlier this week, is still redacted, see Dkt 443, ENS.
Tn Dkt 444 on Page: 4, a full parseraplt about what the Government has

and Bai are e still withheld. The same 1s true of Dkt 445 - ‘both exhibits withheld, and
