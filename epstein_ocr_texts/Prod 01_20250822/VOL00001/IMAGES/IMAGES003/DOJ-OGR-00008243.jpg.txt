Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document528 Filed.12/06/21 Page 7 of8

‘Government would have. aided Jane’s claim. before the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Fund and
that Jane was aware of that fact, as the defense has already argued. And. insofar as the point is to
impeach Jane, this statement is, of minimal impeachment valuc. Jane. said no when asked whether
she knew that. “cooperation. with.the government, including testifying, would benefit you. in-your
civil, litigation against. the Epstcin estate and. Ms..Maxwell.” 12/01/21 Tr. at.581; sce id. (asking
the same question. about. her knowledge “at.any point” regarding Jane's civil litigation). As of.
August.17, 2021, the date of the:statement from.Glassman to the:Government, Jane had been paid.
by the Epstcin Victims Compensation.Fund, and her civil case had,been,dismissed. And’Glassman,
appears.'‘to have advised Jane that the civil cases, were fully resolved. See 12/01/21 Tr. at 619
then, the statement: means, that Glassman, at some ‘point in the past, advised Jane that. testifying
would. aid another “case.” And at most, that would impeach. Jane by suggesting that, while she
accurately testified that she did, not.“know” that her “cooperation with the government, including
testifying,” would benefit her in her civil case: or EVCP claim, she had, béen told. that, at:oné point:
in:the past.

By contrast, there is. ‘significant risk that. admission of the statement; would. require
Glassman. to divulge ‘further privileged communiéations with, Jane. Glassman’s comment ‘to the
Government is not easily intelligible. Glassman referenced. “help[ing] her case,” which is not
specifically a reference to civil litigation or:her claim with the EV-CP, and says that “it,” whatever:
it is, would help that:case. (Def: Letter Ex. A).. To ‘explain what.Glassman is referencing, and

when he’ gave that advice, he would. likely have to provide more content to his advice to Jane and.

“The Government is of course not aware of Glassman’s privileged advice to Jane.
