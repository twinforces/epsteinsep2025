Maxwell. is not accused. of soliciting or enticing sexualized:massages for herself,” Ex. 1,p 4,
these: are proper subjects of Dr. Dictz’s testimony because they form the basis of his principal
responsive opinion:, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are unreliable generally and particularly in the
context of this case. ‘The Rules of Evidence, are clear that an expert.can. inform ‘the: jury of the
bases of his opinions. See Fed..R. Evid. 703.

government. characterizes, Dr. Dictz’s opinion as follows:

(Jt. is: circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive: :and. intent,” because

grooming is defined to ‘be a. strategic pattern of behavior uscd to develop

relationships of attachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. That.is,.

if the behaviors lack. the ‘requisite motive and intent, they arc not grooming

behaviors.

Jd. (citing Ex. 1, p 3). In,an unconsciously revealing way, the government misunderstands: Dr.
Dictz’s. opinion.

The government's objection to Dr. Dictz’s opinion-is the very objection that: Dr..Dictz has
to Dr. Rocchio’s opinion. ‘Dr. Dictz is critical,of Dr. Rocchio’s view of “grooming” because it
‘risks imputing niotive: and intent to innocuous conduct “without, adequate evidence of cither.”
Ex. 1,-p3.:Dr. Dictz proposes to identify this circular reasoning for'the:jury, so jurors can
evaluate:Dr. Roechio’s testimony.and decide whether it:is worth.of belicf.

The tisk of imputing motive and intent is not abstract. After all, the government itself

“(e]vidence of grooming is evidence of intent.” Gov't Resp. to Rule 412 Mot.,:p 7.

435,p 11).,To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony, however, addressing or implying
“srooming-by-proxy,” (terminology. aside, ic. at.10), Dr. Dictz’s opinion is admissible as
déscribed herein.
