Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 499 Filed 11/23/21 Page 10 of 28
Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for herself,” Ex. 1, p 4,
these are proper subjects of Dr. Dietz’s testimony because they form the basis of his principal
responsive opinion: Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are unreliable generally and particularly in the
context of this case. The Rules of Evidence are clear that an expert can inform the jury of the
bases of his opinions. See Fed. R. Evid. 703.

Second, the government claims that Dr. Dietz’s reasoning is “circular.” Mot. at 10. The
government characterizes Dr. Dietz’s opinion as follows:

[I]t is circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive and intent,” because

grooming is defined to be a strategic pattern of behavior used to develop

relationships of attachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. That is,

if the behaviors lack the requisite motive and intent, they are not grooming

behaviors.

Id. (citing Ex. 1, p 3). In an unconsciously revealing way, the government misunderstands Dr.
Dietz’s opinion.

The government’s objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinion is the very objection that Dr. Dietz has
to Dr. Rocchio’s opinion. Dr. Dietz is critical of Dr. Rocchio’s view of “grooming” because it
risks imputing motive and intent to innocuous conduct “without adequate evidence of either.”
Ex. 1, p 3. Dr. Dietz proposes to identify this circular reasoning for the jury, so jurors can
evaluate Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and decide whether it is worth of belief.

The risk of imputing motive and intent is not abstract. After all, the government itself
does so. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 412 motion, the government flat out said that
“Te]vidence of grooming is evidence of intent.” Gov’t Resp. to Rule 412 Mot., p 7.

435, p 11). To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony, however, addressing or implying
“srooming-by-proxy,” (terminology aside, id. at 10), Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as
described herein.
