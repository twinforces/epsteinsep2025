The Court rejected the defendant’s argument that the strength of the evidence was
diminished by her then-pending pre-trial motions (which have since been denied). (/d. at 5-6). The
Court also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by the defendant, noting the
“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the [foreign
citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed monitorship, the defendant
“would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to

assurances.” (/d. at 11).

4. The Second Circuit’s Orders

The defendant filed appeals from the Court’s second and third detention orders. After
hearing oral argument, the Circuit denied the defendant’s motion for bail in a written order. (See

Following that decision, the defendant submitted a letter to this Court asking it “to address
Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing MDC to cease 15-minute light surveillance of Ms.
Maxwell or justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.” (Dkt. 256 at 2). The Court
promptly ordered the Government to confer with MDC counsel and provide the Court with an
explanation regarding the use of flashlights and the basis for it, which the Government then did.
(Dkt. 257, 270). On May 14, 2021, this Court issued an order denying the defendant’s request for
an order directing the MDC to modify its nighttime monitoring schedule. (Dkt. 282). In reaching
this decision, the Court noted that the defendant’s claim that MDC staff were shining the light
directly into her eyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual
