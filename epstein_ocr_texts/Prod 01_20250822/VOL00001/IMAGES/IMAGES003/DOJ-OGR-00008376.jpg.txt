Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document545 Filed 12/15/21 Page3of9
(AKT), 2017 WL 3037408, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. July 17, 2017) (“[T]here is a presumption disfavoring
attorney depositions which is based on the recognition that even a deposition of counsel limited to
relevant and non-privileged information risks disrupting the attorney-client relationship and
impeding the litigation.” (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)); ABA Model Rule 3.7
cmt. (noting potential conflict of interest issues that arise if, for instance, “there is likely to be
substantial conflict between the testimony of the client and that of the lawyer”).

Il. Discussion

The defendant seeks to call three attorneys for victims: Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and
Robert Glassman. For each, the proposed testimony is either duplicative of facts already in
evidence, is irrelevant or is improper impeachment. And in any event, whatever marginal
probative value that testimony might offer is outweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion
associated with calling an attorney to testify against his client.

A. Jack Scarola

The defendant proposes to call Jack Scarola, counsel for Carolyn, to testify about the course
of his communications with the Government. While that testimony would not be privileged, it is
irrelevant and improper impeachment.

Much of the testimony the defendant seeks from Scarola is evidence confirmed by Carolyn
on cross-examination. Specifically, Carolyn agreed to the following facts:

e Jack Scarola represented Carolyn in her 2008 lawsuit and before the Epstein Victims

Compensation Program. (Tr. 1617-18).

e Carolyn did not contact the Government between 2007 and March 2019, and then again
was out of touch until her representative, Mr. Danchuck, responded in July 2020. (Tr.
