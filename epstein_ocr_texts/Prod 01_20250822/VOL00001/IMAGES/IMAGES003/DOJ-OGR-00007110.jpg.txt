corroborative of the other evidence at trial.
THE COURT: THe charged conspiracy ends and then
Mr. Epstein maintains. addresses of individuals alleged to be
victims hére. Is that the context?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor; but mone specifically with
respect té6 thé two categories of exhibits, the first would

include messages that. were Jeft at the residence during the

time frame of the charged conspiracy, they are dated and

include a name of a victim and her contact informat.ion, and so
this witness will be authenticating those. Those documents

With mespect. to a second category of information --

THE GOURT: And you Have. a withess who woéuld

conduét which, presumably, wouldn't be somebody who d6esn't

Gome onto the scene until after the time period of the charged
