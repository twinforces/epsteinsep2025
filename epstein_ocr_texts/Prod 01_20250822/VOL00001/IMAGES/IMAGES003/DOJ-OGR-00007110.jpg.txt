1 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

2 The category of exhibits that this witness would be

3 authenticating would include, among other things, contact

4 information for the minor victims and so the fact that that

a contact information and messages from those victims was in

6 Mr. Epstein's residence and, in part, in the defendant's

7 possession is relevant regardless of the time frame and is

8 corroborative of the other evidence at trial.

9 THE COURT: The charged conspiracy ends and then

10 Mr. Epstein maintains addresses of individuals alleged to be
11 victims here. Is that the context?

12 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor; but more specifically with
13 respect to the two categories of exhibits, the first would

14 include messages that were left at the residence during the

15 time frame of the charged conspiracy, they are dated and

16 include a name of a victim and her contact information and so
17 this witness will be authenticating those. Those documents

18 come from the time frame of the charged conspiracy and were

19 created at the time frame of the charged conduct.
20 With respect to a second category of information --
21 THE COURT: And you have a witness who would
22 authenticate that they were created at the time of the charged
23 conduct which, presumably, wouldn't be somebody who doesn't
24 come onto the scene until after the time period of the charged
25 conduct. Fair to say?
