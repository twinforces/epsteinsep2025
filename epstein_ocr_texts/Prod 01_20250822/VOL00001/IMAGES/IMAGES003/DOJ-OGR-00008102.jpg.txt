The decision, in United States v: Robinson is instructive. ‘In that case—which concerned
an alleged firearm sale in 2008 evidence showed the:Cl had a significant history of drug use
dating to 2000. 583 F.3d at 1271. Records revealed.a history of using opioids, alcohol, cannabis,
benzodiazepine, Valium, Klonipin, Darvocet, and hydrocodone. Jd. at 1271-72. The district
court; howéver, forbade the defendant from. cross-cxamining the Cl on his drug use. The Court. of
Appeals reversed, explaining that

[iJllegal drug use does, not merely bear on the Cl’s veracity but.also on. his:capacity’

asa witness. .. . Extensive drug ‘tse: since 2000, suggests that the Cl could have:

been under the influcnce at the time of the alleged fircarm. sale. Morcover, ifthe

witness was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time he testifies, this

condition is‘provable, on cross or by extrinsic evidence, to. impeach. Had Robinson.

known,that'the C] had. much more than, “a, little bit?’ ofa drug problem, he:certainly’

would have explored’whether the ‘Cl was using drugs atthe time of the alleged.sale

or at the time. of trial.
Jd, at: 1272 (citing Wnited States v. Crosby, 462. F.2d.1201, 1203 (D:C. Cir. 1972); 4 Jack B.
Weinstcin & Margarct A. Berger, Weinstcin’s Federal Evidence, § 607.05[1] (Joseph M.
McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2009); Kenncth S. Broun, McCormick on Evidence § 44 (6th.ed. 2006))
(cleaned up).

This Court.should. adhere to DiPaold and. Robinson and.rejcct the government’s attempt
to preclude Ms. Maxwell. from what is, “of course,” proper cross-cxamination. DiPaole, 804

F.2d at 229; see Robinson, 583. F.3d at 1272.
