C. Ms. Maxwell reiterates her request to defer briefing and ruling on ‘the
admissibility of —_______][._______________] and. exhibits for:two
weeks.

For. the reasons: already detailed, the complexity:of the issues and.the factthat(—]

[~~ recently disclosed testimony appears to be of utmost centrality to the government's

submit.a comprchensive ‘motion in /imine concerning, the introduction of. this testimony: and
exhibits as supposed direct evidence ofthe charged conspiracy.. In,that-there remains, a full
month. before opening. statements, Ms. Maxwell's fundamental. rights to present'a defense, to
have:the effective assistance of counsel, and to.a right-to confront’witnesses and subpoena,
‘witnesses, to testify in her defense all, will be preserved by.'a,small delay on this issuc.

JH. THIS COURT SHOULD EXCLUDE LISA ROCCHIO'S TESTIMONY UNDER

PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.,'509 U.S.'579 (1993) AND:‘GRANT A DAUBERT
HEARING

A. This Court should:reject the government’s arguments to the extent that they are
based on newly. disclosed, material, which this Court ordered the government to
produce six, months ago.

Recognizing that Rocchio’s proposed testimony is‘on shaky ground (to say the Icast), the
government’ belatedly tries to: shore up its case and hoist up its expert witness. Two days ago, and
six.months after the courtimposed deadline for expert disclostires, the government first
disclosed to.defense counscl. about 300 pages of material.on-which Rocchio apparently relied:in
reaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to:save
Rocchio’s testimony. from exclusion. See Wnited, States v.. Lewis, 818 F. App?x 74, 79 (2d Cir.
2020):(unpublished) (affirming exclusion of defendant’ s proffered. expert evidence: “that did not

adhere to the discovery schedule”).
