In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well. as
circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak’ louder than words,” applics here. Often,
the only evidence that is available:with respect to the existence of.a conspiracy is that.of
disconnected ‘acts and conduct;on the’part of the alleged:individual co-conspirators. When.taken,
altogether and considered as'whole, however, these acts and conduct may‘warrant the inferencé
that a conspiracy existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an,express
agreement.

In short, :as far as the first element. of the conspiracy: is: concerned, the Government must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came’ to a:mutual

understanding, cither’ spoken. or unspoken, to, violate: the law.in the manner charged, in Counts

One, Three, .and Five: of the: Indictment.
