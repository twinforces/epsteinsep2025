1 which conviction the government has conceded would be

2 inappropriate, would be unlawful.

3 MS. MOE: I understand the Court's concern and we

4 certainly don't anticipate eliciting testimony about the

5 victim's conclusions about the event or suggesting that it was
6 unlawful or satisfied certain elements. My point was simply in
7 describing it, which would be difficult for Minor Victim-3,

8 that sort of her feelings about that or the circumstances that
9 that -- in narrating the facts of the event would I think come
10 to light at trial, but we certainly don't intend to elicit

11 testimony about conclusions, about things like consent or

12 whether it was lawful, and particularly in light of the Court's
13 ruling, and in any event, we wouldn't be seeking to proffer

14 legal conclusions from a witness.

15 THE COURT: Okay. Anything further on that, counsel?
16 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.

17 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor, thank you.

18 THE COURT: Defendant's 5 I think we determined is a
19 non-issue. This goes to evidence that the defense was
20 concerned in the government presenting regarding flight, and
21 the government has represented that it will not offer evidence
22 as to flight. Is that correct, Ms. Moe?
23 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: Anything else we need to address here?
25 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.
