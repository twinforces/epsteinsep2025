particular page. We have:considered these:concerns and would like to propose a solution that we:
believe'will address these issues and safeguard the:privacy interests of the witnesses, and at the same.
time:provide for an. efficient trial.and protect Ms. Maxwell’s:rights.

The defense’ proposes that the:partics be permitted. to display documents uscd. for impeachment.
or refreshing recollection. only. on the video screens used bythe witness, the Court, and the Court’s
deputy. None of these sereens face the gallery or the jury box and cannot be: seen. by anyone in the
audicnee or by members of the jury. The documents will, not be displayed on the ‘sercens at counsel.
table, which face the gallery, of on the juror screens.

While the defense may display a:particular page of a.document to the witness to impeach or

refresh recollection, we will have the complete document. available in-clectronic form. If the witness
wishes to sce other pages: of the: document, we can. display: those: pages: on.the-witness’s serecn at the
witness’s request. Most importantly, this process will allow counsel to highlight or direct-the witness’s
attention clectronically to particular sections of the 3500 matcrials, without having to .describe'the
particular paragraph number or:sentence in (sometimes) voluminous, dense, multi-page FBI 302 reports.
Additionally, it will ensure that the witness is looking at the correct exhibit, rather‘than, at other potential,
impeachment material in.a binder before them, especially since defense counsel is, not placed ita
position’within the courtroom that permits us to: see what exhibit or page the witness has open in, front of
them on the witness stand. Finally, it will obviate the ‘necd. to approach a witness, which is difficult with
the Covid protocols and:courtroom sct-up, to direct'the witness to a particular:exhibit or section of an.
The government.has advised that it docs not:require: copies of any of the: 3500 materials or the

government exhibits. If the defense uses any documents to:impeach or refresh recollection that.are not.
