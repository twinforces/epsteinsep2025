Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) AN () ig
Dear Judge Nathan: 11/4/21
The Government respectfully moves for reconsideration of the portions of the Court’s order
dated November 3, 2021 (Dkt. No. 409), directing the Government to file by November 8, 2021,
any briefing to exclude any defense witness testimony disclosed on November 1, 2021, with
defense responses due November 11, 2021.
This schedule provides the Government seven days—or six, if timed from the Court’s
order—to respond to the defense’s expert notice, in which they gave notice for the first time of
eight potential experts. By contrast, the Government notes that it provided the defense with notice
of its expert on April 23, 2021, and the defense filed its motion to preclude on October 18, 2021.1
Moreover, during that time, the Government will be (1) preparing for the November 10,
2021 Daubert hearing; (2) responding to the defendant’s motion for reconsideration regarding
disclosure of juror names (Dkt. No. 407); (3) providing the defense with categories of its co-
conspirator statements and exemplars; (4) briefing the admissibility of Minor Victim-3’s testimony
' The Government also provided expert notice of a witness who it does not believe requires
admission through Rule 702 on September 15, 2021. The defense has not moved to preclude that
witness.
