amendment to, and an impermissible variance of, the Indictment. As this Court previously has
ruled:

"To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that

‘the terms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence

and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense charged that

there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an

offense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States y. D’Amelio, 683

F.3d 412, 416 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729

(Q2d_ Cir. 1988)). Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a

defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a “per

se violation” of the defendant’s constitutional rights—1.e. there is no requirement

that a defendant make a specific showing of prejudice. /d. at 417. In contrast to a

constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the

indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially

different from those alleged in the indictment.” /d. (quoting United States _v.

Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608, 621 (2d Cir. 2003)).
United States v. Gross, 15-cr-769 (AJN), 2017 WL 4685111, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2017).

As this Court then recognized, the Second Circuit has consistently relied on the same
start and end dates of a conspiracy to find that differing trial proof did not affect a constructive
amendment or variance. See id. ("The indictment and the evidence at trial contained the same
starting and ending dates of the conspiracy...") (quoting United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208,
229 (2d. Cir. 2007)); see also United States v. Dupre, 462 F.3d 131, 141 (2d Cir. 2006) ("The
starting and ending dates of the conspiracy noted in the indictment correspond to the conspiracy
proven at trial..."). Conversely, the substantial quantity of testimony — for the post-conspiracy
time eric {NN
WE. Who never met any of the four accusers as far as can be gleaned, and the documents she
intends to authenticate, run a substantial risk that the government's proof at trial will not be the
same core evidence charged in the Indictment because it will be based on evidence that post-
dates the events charged in the Indictment.
