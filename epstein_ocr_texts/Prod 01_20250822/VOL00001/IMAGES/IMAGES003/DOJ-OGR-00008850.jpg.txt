The defense told the government that, in light.of Ms. Andriano’s statements, we did not,
see any. ‘privacy interest that could justify:redacting her name in any further court filings.
Although. we did not receive a response: from the: government, the government ultimately sent the
Court a proposed redacted-version of Court Exhibit 2. which:redacted the full names of witnesses
who ‘testified under pscudonyms aid the last names of witnesses'who testificd’using only'their first
names. The government:also followed the defense’s request and.did not:redact‘Ms. Andriano’s
last-name.

Carolyn.Andriano is:now in the:same position as Annic Farmer, who'publicly waived her
right-to anonymity. and gave public statements to the media. under‘her full name. Accordingly, the
defense respectfully submits that Ms. Aridriano’s last name should not be redacted in the version
‘of Court Exhibit 2 that:is filed on the public docket.

Andriano’s last name shouldbe redacted. Onec ‘the, Court:rules, we'will file an appropriately
redacted version. of this Ictter on;the-public docket and. coordinate’with the government to provide
