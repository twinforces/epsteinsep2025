Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 440 Filed 11/12/21 Page 39 of 40

‘inflammatory and prejudicial statement-or questions by the defense. The Court should not indulge
the defense’s effort to gct these inflammatory arguments ‘in front.of the jury before the Court.can
rule on this issuc.

I. The Court;Should Not Allow the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant,
Prevailed, Against the Minor Victims ‘in Litigation

The fact that the defendant “prevailed” :in litigation, for purposes of awarding a.:small.
amountiof costs, is irrelevant. ‘That litigation resolved through a-voluntary' dismissal in.connection,
with a scttlement. To be sure, the defendant:is a’prevailing,party'as part ofthe cost-shifting statute,
and soher current counsel soughta total.of| __], presumably in.part for the purpose of making
‘this improper argument at frial. (See Def. Opp. 'at.57-59). But:any. suggestion that the defendant.
“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated. the substance of
claims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permitted. to elicit this
testimony; the Government will ncéd to explain the relevant Icegal principles to, the jury, showing
them that—contrary to the:defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is.a technicality, and the
litigation, terminated with, a. settlement. (See id. at 58); Even, if there were marginal, probative
valué in.a civil ease, it would deeply: confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed.
substantively, and:would-require a.mini-trial on the meaning of.a’prevailing ‘partyin civil litigation.
See:Fed. R. Evid. 403:

The defense would make this trial, about. many things it is not: the: Florida, investigation,
various civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged. motives, among others. None. of!
