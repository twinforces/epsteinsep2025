1 admissible under the usual rules of relevance. In White, the

2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible
3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that

4 testified at the defendant's trial.

S As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale

6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an
7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not

8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today

9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and

10 assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of

11 reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided
12 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision
13 could be understood as a determination that in 2008 the

14 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,
15 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number
16 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has little
17 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.

18 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of
19 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be
20 prejudicial pursuant to 403 both because they would require
21 significant time to explore and because juror confusion would
22 be likely. Any consideration of the government's decisions
23 would also likely rely on hearsay or other inadmissible
24 evidence. More importantly, unlike in White, those officials'
25 assessments of the evidence in Florida in 2008 is not relevant
