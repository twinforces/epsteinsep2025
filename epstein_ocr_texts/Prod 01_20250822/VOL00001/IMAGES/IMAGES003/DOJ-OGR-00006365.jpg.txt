Victims from potential harassment from the media and others, undue embarrassment, and other
adverse consequences.

certain witnesses related to them be referred to at trial using only pseudonyms; (2) Minor
Victim-4, Minor Victim-6, and certain witnesses related to them be referred to at trial using only
their first names; (3) the Court preclude the defense from eliciting personally identifying details
of those witnesses; and (4) the Court seal exhibits that contain the first and/or last names of
witnesses which are not otherwise permitted to be stated at trial. Below, we address the
applicable law, before turning to the specific relief the Government requests in this case. !

A. Applicable Law

The Confrontation Clause guarantees defendants the right to cross-examine witnesses
who testify against them. See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2008).
This right, however, is not absolute. A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must
yield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For
instance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits ... on. . . cross-
examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the
witness’s safety.” United States v. Al Farekh, 810 F. App’x 21, 25 (2d Cir. 2020) (summary
' Simultaneously with the filing of this motion, the Government is filing a sealed letter providing
the names of the Minor Victims and witnesses identified in this section, along with certain other
personal information. The Government requests that the defense omit identifying information
from its response brief or permit the Government an opportunity to seek necessary redactions or
sealing.
