D. Evidence and Argument,About the Scope, Timeline, and Investigative Steps of
Prior Investigations Is Admissible

The government’s motion:to preclude the defense from. cliciting evidence about the
‘investigative’ steps taken, in the Florida Investigation ‘and, the New. York Investigation, and the
duration of those investigations (SceMot. at 29-32), 1s entirely off base and breathtaking in the
scope of what:it secks to restrict. It:is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning
about its investigations at.all. ‘That:is ecrtainly‘not the law. For example, the decision to
‘questioning the casc agents about.-who they spoke to.and when they’ spoke to them is irrelevant?
Similarly, the: decision to issue a subpocna for documents is.an investigative step. Does the
government really mean.to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they
subpoenaed and, when they. subpoenaed them:is irrelevant? Furthermore, the government will

scope, timeline, and. resolution ‘of the investigation, as well. as the:various investigative steps
taken by the agents”). The defense is aware ofthe rule that it may:comment on the ‘absence of

proofiin the record, but it is not permitted to arguc that the government should have used any
