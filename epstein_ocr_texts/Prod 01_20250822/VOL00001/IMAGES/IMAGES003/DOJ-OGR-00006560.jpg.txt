Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 441 Filed 11/12/21 Page4of12

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through counsel, requests that the Court enter an order
precluding the government from introducing any alleged co-conspirator statements under Federal
Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) because the government failed to comply with the Court’s Order
of September 3, 2021 (Dkt. 335). In support of this request, Ms. Maxwell states:

statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October 11, as consistent with this Court’s
scheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at 1.” (emphasis in original.)

On October 11, 2021, the government identified three purported co-conspirators for
purposes of trial: Jeffrey Epstein, [x | Thc
government, however, failed and refused to disclose “a// (or any) co-conspirator statements it
intends to introduce at trial....” Instead, the government, circumventing the plain meaning of the
