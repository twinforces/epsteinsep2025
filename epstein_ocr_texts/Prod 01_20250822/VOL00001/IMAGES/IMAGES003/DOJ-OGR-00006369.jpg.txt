Indeed, in two recent highly publicized cases in the Eastern District of New York, the
district court judges permitted victims to testify using pseudonyms or using only their first

Cr. 809 (PKC), 2013 WL 3936185, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2013) (permitting use of pseudonym
for undercover agent in narcotics case).
