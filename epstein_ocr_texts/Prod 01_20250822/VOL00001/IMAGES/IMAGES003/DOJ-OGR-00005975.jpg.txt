amendment to, and.an impermissible variance’ of, the Indictment. As this Court previously has
‘ruled:

"To prevail.on.a.constructive:amendment claim, a:defendant:must demonstrate that
‘the terms of [an] indictment. are in effect altered by the presentation. of evidence’
and jury instructions which so. modify essential elements ofthe offense charged that
thére isa substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an
offense other'than that charged :in the indictment.” United States \. D?Amélio, 683 |
F.3d.412,-416 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting United: States vi Mollicd, 849 F.2d 723, 729°
(2d. Cir. 1988)). ‘Because: the: doctrine ‘of constructive amendment protects a.
defendant’s. Grand Jury Clause/rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a.“‘per
sc violation” of the defendant’s constitutional rights=1.c. there is no requirement;
that a. defendant makeé a specific showing of prejudice. Jd. at 417. In contrast.to.a
constructive ‘amendment, “[a] variance occurs when. the charging terms of the
indictment are left unaltered, ‘but the evidence: at trial proves facts materially:
different from those alleged. in, the indictment.” Jd. (quoting United States v:
Salmonese; 352 F.3d 608,621 (2d Cir. 2003)).

United States v..Gross, 15-cr-769 (AJN), 2017 WL.4685111, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2017).
As this Court then recognized, the Second, Circuit. has consistently relicd on. the same
start. and end. dates of a conspiracy to find that differing trial. proof did:riot affect a constructive
amendment or-variance. See. id. ("The indictment and, the evidence at:trial contained the same:
‘starting and ending dates of the conspiracy...") (quoting United States 'v: Rigas, 490 F.3d.208,
229 (2d. Cir. 2007)); see also United Statés ¥. Dupre, 462 F.3d 131, 141. (2d-Cir. 2006) ("The
starting and ending dates of the conspiracy noted in,the indictment correspond to the conspiracy’
proven at trial..."). Conversely, the substantial quantity of testimony = for the: post=conspiracy:
ge petiod $$ AA ooo ao
(7), who never:met.any of the four aecusers.as far as can be gleaned, and.the documents she
intends to authenticate, run.a substantial risk that the government's proof at trial will noe be the
same: core evidence: charged in.the: Indictment because: it-will be based on evidence: that post-

dates:the events charged. in the Indictment.
