appropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a better way to allow the child
to engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s
guardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the
pool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase
the probability that abuse will occur in the future.
In this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the
fact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to
supervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing
swimsuit, and allows the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding
what is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-
tains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second
alternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-
lihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the
second criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase
the likelihood of future abuse.

Again, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments
for a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.
The situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised
or ambiguous by the would-be abuser. However, this approach does allow
the generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable
and thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be
rationally identified.

Finally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated
with respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and
specificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-
ods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics
of this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.

Obviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-
erates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample
of what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of
normal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this
definition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of
false positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of
studies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to
occur in attempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be
used to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-
posed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating
different types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,
young children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the
extent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.
Again, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations
are found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research
with high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of
