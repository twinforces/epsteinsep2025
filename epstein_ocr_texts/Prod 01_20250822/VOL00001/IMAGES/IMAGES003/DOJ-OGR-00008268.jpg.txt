For her part, Ms. Maxwell wasn’t even shown a book, let alone a book that was either
two inches thick or 1/4 inch thick. She was shown photocopies of pages from something, the
origin of which no one knows.

Second, even if Deposition Exhibit 13 was the same as Exhibit 52 (which it isn’t), Ms.
Maxwell’s testimony about Exhibit 13 is insufficient to authenticate or lay the foundation for the
admission of Exhibit 52. Ms. Maxwell expressly and repeatedly disclaimed any knowledge of
who created Deposition Exhibit 13, when it was created, and whether it was a complete and
accurate copy of whatever it was copied from:
