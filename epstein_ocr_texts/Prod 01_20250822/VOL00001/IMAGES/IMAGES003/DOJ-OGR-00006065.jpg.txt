Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Attached please find the parties’ joint request to charge and proposed verdict sheet. The
Government is docketing a redacted version today and submitting the unredacted versions to the
Court. The redline text in the documents reflect the objections of the defense. Further detail of
the parties’ objections are contained in comment bubbles.

The Government has proposed the only redactions in the Request to Charge. These
proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the Government’s
request to charge is a judicial document subject to the common law presumption of access, the
proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of a third party.

The Government is also providing under seal Exhibit A, which pertains to a defense
comment. The defense informs the Government that this exhibit is a document from another case

DOJ-OGR-00006065
