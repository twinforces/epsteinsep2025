harmed by conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy—and she was—then she is a “victim” under
the relevant statutes.

Finally, Minor Victim-3 is also a “victim” for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 412,
because she is clearly someone who “can reasonably be characterized as a ‘victim of alleged sexual
misconduct.’” Fed. R. Evid. 412, Advisory Committee Notes (1994). Given Rule 412’s broad
application in not just criminal cases but also civil cases such as claims of sexual harassment, see
Wolak v. Spucci, 217 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir. 2000), it cannot be read to define victims as only those
individuals whose victimization would alone satisfy all of the elements of a charged crime. As set
forth above, Epstein’s conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 is plainly “alleged sexual
misconduct,” and therefore she is a victim as defined in Rule 412.

For these reasons, Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under the provisions of federal law
discussed above. Moreover, the Government respectfully submits that even if its reading of these
provisions is incorrect, that does not affect the admissibility of Minor Victim-3’s testimony as
direct evidence: evidence that does not itself establish every element of the charged crime may
nevertheless be admissible as direct evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 110 F.3d 941,
942 (2d Cir. 1997); United States v. Carboni, 204 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2000). And Minor Victim-
3’s status as a “victim” under the foregoing provisions of law certainly does not affect the
admissibility of her testimony under Rule 404(b), which permits the admission of other act
testimony that almost by definition does not satisfy the elements of the charged crime. The
testimony should be admitted.
