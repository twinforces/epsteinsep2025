harmed by conduct :in, furtherance. of the conspitacy—and she was—then. she is.a “victim” under
the relevant statutes.

Finally, Minor Victim-3 is also.a. “victim” for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 412,
because she is clearly:someone who “can:reasonably be characterized as a “victim-of alleged sexual
misconduct.” Fed. R.. Evid. 412, Advisory Committee Notes (1994). Given Rule 412’s broad.
application in not. just criminal. casés but also civil. cases such.as claims of sexual harassment, sce
Wolak-y. Spucci, 21,7 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir. 2000), it cannot be read to define victims as ‘only those
individuals. whose victimization, would alone satisfy all of the elements of a charged crime. As set:
forth above, Epstcin’s, conduct with, respect ‘to Minor Victim-3 is plainly “alleged sexual
misconduct,” and.therefore: she is a-victim as defined in, Rule 41:2.

For these; reasons, Minor: Victim-3: is a. “victim” ‘under the provisions of federal, law’
discussed. above. Morcover, the Government respectfully submits that even iftits reading ‘of these:
provisions is incorrect, that docs ‘not affect the admissibility of Minor Victim-3’s testimony as
direct evidence: evidence that, docs not itself establish every clement of the charged crime may’
nevertheless be admissible: as direct evidence. See, e'g., United States'v. Gonzalez, 110-F.3d 941,
942 (2d Cir. 1997); Whited States. v.' Carhoni, 204 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2000). And Minor Victim-
3°S status as,a “victim” under the foregoing provisions of law certainly does :not affcet the
‘testimony’ that..almost; by’ definition docs not satisfy the elements of the charged crime. The

testimony: should. be admitted.
