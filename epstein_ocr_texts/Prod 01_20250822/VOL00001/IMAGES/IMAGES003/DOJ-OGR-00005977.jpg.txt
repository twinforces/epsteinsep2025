In any case, the ‘newly discovered, material, doesn’t help the government’s cause. Exhibit
A (literally) to the government’s response is a journal. article describing “grooming” as a
“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie: Bennett & William O” Donohue, dhe Construct of Grooming in
Child. Sexual Abuse, 23. J. Child Sexual,Abuse 957, 974 (2014).:(In fact, Ms. Maxwell, cited this:
article in hermotion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s éonclusions, the article proves theit
There have been claims that; some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”
priorto. committing, abuse. These behaviors, commonly known. as “grooming,” are,
understood as methods child molesters use to gain..acccss. to. and prepare future:
victims'to’be compliant with abuse. However, thereis.a lack of consensus regarding
exactly. what this, process entails and how it is clearly distinguished from. noi mal

adult_child, interactions. « . . Furthermore, there. are no ‘methods of known.
psyvchometrics te validly Gssess. grooming:

Gov't Resp.,'Ex. A, p2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:
Currently’ there ‘is, no consensus regarding how’ to define grooming. In addition,
thére ‘is no valid 'method’to assess Whether grooming has occurred, or is occurring.
The field possesses an. insufficient amount. of knowledge about key issues such. as:
the interrater reliability of these judgments or the:error. rates of these judgments.
including the frequency of false negatives or false ‘positives. hus currently: it
appears that grooming is not.a-construel that ought to be used in forensic settings
as it does not Meet SOme Of the eriteria.in the Daubert standard. ... Right.now i
does. not dppear to.bé the case that there are “reliable principles and methods”
define and detect grooming.
Id. at:1.9 (emphasis added).
Because the government cannot justify admission. of Rocchio’s testimony’ based on its
prejudicially late disclosures, and.:because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and
‘underscore that “grooming” is not.a scientific:principle based on psychometric testing, this Court.

should. preclude Rocchio from-testifying. And.as ‘explained below, the government’s other

defenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required. by Rules 401, 402, 403, 404, 702, and 704.
