Dissociation: Dissociation, is. “the lack ofthe normal integration. of thoughts, feclings,
and éxpericncés into the stream of consciousness and mémory. Dissociation involves a
disruption or splitting off oftmemory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions
‘of the self'and ‘surroundings; it ‘can. ‘be recurring, gradual, ortransient. It is: likely associated. with
memory: distortions. Thus, it is ‘possible that.in the event of a:scxual assault, dissociation may
cause:a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are ‘not clearly’ remembered, with ‘events.
that for them feasibly'could. have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be
filled in'with a:‘confabulated event, let alone, a sexvial. one. However, individuals who dissociate.
ata high frequency may seck to make thcir-storics more coherent by adding details to.an
incomplete:memory that would make sense to:them;when, considered:in the context of the event.
Thus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, ‘including
‘who the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and how many times.

Intellectual. Disability: Intellectual disability, is:;characterized by: below average IQ and
adaptive functioning. Limitations in, functioning include deficits in the: acquisition, of ‘social,
occupational, academic, and. general self-care skills. Intellectual, disability has ‘several ctiologics
‘that often, are related to biological or pathological ‘processes affecting the central ‘nervous system.
Many. of the specific vulncrabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent
with other disorders (c.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and
individuals with other developmental disabilitics may also-have intellectual disability.
Intellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without. ID, have’vulncrabilities
related to memory and communication, that:the legal system may’ not be equipped to handle
adequately. Individuals with. nioderate-to-profound.ID may have significant difficulty
communicating, about the vents that occurred because of language Skills deficits or other
communication-interfering conditions (c.g., related: neurological conditions). ‘Research findings
indicate:that. communications skills are essential in filing a sexual, assault charge; alleged victims
with mild ID were more likely than individuals:with moderate or severe ID not only to file
sexual, assault charges but.to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties, with: memory: may
also. complicate. the investigation process ‘for individuals with ID.

Changes in,the core details of the allegation arc often’used by ‘professionals as' indices jin,
determining the eredibility‘of a.victim’s claims. Peace and, colleagues (2015) conducted a
narrative analysis of 147:scts of allegations of:scxual assault. across, short (3'month) and long (6
month) intervals’ since the alleged event took’ place. In reviewing: the, existing literature, Peace.
and colleagues: found that genuine traumatic experiences have.a demonstrable resiliency: to
drastic impairments in recall. However, some inconsistencies: especially in, less: core matters are
to'be expected, due to some less important-details fading or-varying over time. In cxamining their
sample of 147 allegations, the ‘rescarchers discovered. that: truthful allegations, contained:more
detail relative to ‘false allegations at.cach.of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers
found that fabricated allegations of traumatic ‘experiences ‘contained more. inconsistent details
both at 3 months and 6 months. The:total amount of detail. for cach’type of allegation (truc.or
false) docs tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers
found that the number of details present ‘in genuine reports continued to decrease over time
Whereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off in-detail.
