alleged to have taken place involving.Ms. Maxwell or.in. her presence. You may consider this:
evidence:in determining. whether the Government has proven beyond a'reasonable doubt:Ms.
Maxwell’s knowledge of the unlawful purposes of the conspiracy.

It is for-you.to determine whether. the Government has established beyond a:reasonable:

doubt'that. such knowledge and intent on‘the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important; for you

to know'that!Ms. Maxwell’s. participation in.thé, conspiracy must be established, by independent

evidence of her own acts or statements, as ‘well as those of the other alleged ‘co-conspirators, and.

‘the reasonable inferences that may’ be drawn from that evidence.

It is‘tiot necessary for the Government to Show that Ms. Maxwell:was fully informed as
to all, the details of the conspiracy in order for'you.to infer knowledge on her part. To'’have

guilty knowledge, Ms. Maxwell need‘not have known the ‘full, extent ofthe conspiracy or all. of

‘the activities of all. ofits participants. It is not:even-necessary fora defendant to know every

other memiber of the conspiracy.
In addition, the duration.and extent of Ms. Maxwell’s participation has no bearing on the
issue of her guilt. She need.not have joined the conspiracy at-the outset. Ms..Maxwell may-have

joined. it for any purpose at. any time in. its progress, ‘and she will be held. responsible. for all that.

‘was done before she joined and all. that-was done during the. conspiracy’s existence while she

‘perform them at different‘times. Indeed, aisingle act: may be enough to bring' one within, the

membership of the conspiracy, provided that Ms. Maxwell. was aware of the:conspiracy and

knowingly associated herself with. its criminal aims. It does not matter whether Ms. Maxwell’s

role in‘the conspiracy may have been more, limited than or different in nature, or'in length of time
