Proposed Intervenors therefore respectfully request that the Court unseal Ms. Maxwell’s

motion for a new trial, and its related exhibits, in their entirety, as well as future submissions
related to this motion. Proposed Intervenors do not expect that Ms. Maxwell can prove that
“closure is essential to preserve higher values” that outweigh the public’s right of access to any
portion of the filings. See Donato, 714 F. App’x at 76. However, if she can prove such higher
values exist, Proposed Intervenors request that such information be subject to limited redactions
and that the remainder of the filings be unsealed. See id. (noting that, even where sealing is
appropriate, it must be “narrowly tailored” by applying redactions rather than withholding the
document in its entirety).

Sincerely yours,

HOLLAND & KNIGHT LLP
