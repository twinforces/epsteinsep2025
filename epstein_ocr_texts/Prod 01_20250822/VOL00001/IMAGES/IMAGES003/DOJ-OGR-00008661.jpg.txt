Instruction No. 31: Coimts One, Thiée, and Five: Conspiracy to. Violate Federal. Laws —
Conspiracy and. Substantive Counts

‘Counts One, Three, and'Five of the Indictment. each. charge Ms. Maxwell. with,

‘participating ina “conspiracy.” The relevant statute for Counts One, Three, and Five is Title ‘18,

‘United States Code, Section.37],, which, provides that, “if two or more people ‘conspire [] to

commit any offense against the United States . . . and one or more of such persons do any act to
effect:the object.of the conspiracy,” each-person is guilty ofa federal.crime.
As | will explain, a. conspiracy is‘a‘kind of criminal partnership—an agreement of two-or

moré people 'to join togethér to accomplish. some unlawful purpose. The crite of conspiracy 'to

‘violate federal law is an independent offense. It:is separate and distinct from-the actual
‘violation. of any: specific federal. laws, which the law refers, to as “substantive crimes.” ‘Indeed,

‘you inay find Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiting torviolate federal law even if'you-find that the

crime ‘which was the object, of the conspiracy was never actually committed.
As I will explain, the’three different conspiracy counts ‘are separate offenses and each

conspiracy alleges a different purpose, which. will describe:to you shortly.
