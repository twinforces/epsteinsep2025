8 pay for a lawyer for an alleged victim who was anticipated to

9 testify and agreed not to contest her civil suit against him.
10 The civil suit ended in a settlement with respect to an alleged
11 victim.

12 Of course, defendants are always able to cross-examine
13 witnesses about relevant bias. For example, crossâ€”-examination
14 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or

15 others and related financial incentive are fair grounds.

16 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined

17 about how testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.

19 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may
20 cross-examine about that. But the defense has not explained
21 any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates
22 to the NPA. Regardless of how the witness covered by the NPA

25 the NPA does not provide protection in the Southern District of
