1 government with this article, Exhibit 3, "Validation of Sexual
2 Grooming Model of Child Sex Abusers," which I think you said

3 that you thought that these authors, Winters and Jeglic, were
4 credible. Is that right?

5 A. I said I believed that they have done a lot of research in
6 the field. I don't think I used the word "credible."

7 Q. OK. It's something, though, that you provided to the

8 government as support for your testimony here today. Is that
9 right?
10 A. It is some information pertaining to my testimony, yes.
11 Q. So let's continue a little bit in terms of what this study
12 involved. First of all, there were a total of 18 people that
13 responded to this survey. Is that right?
14 A. That was the second half, I believe, of the study that
15 you're referring to. This was a two-part study. So my
16 understanding is in the second part, there were 18 individuals
17 who are experts in the field, yes.
18 Q. All right. The pertinent one is the literature review.
19 Right?
20 A. It was done in a structured way, though. It wasn't just a
21 summary of the literature. But, yes. The first part was a
22 culling of scientific literature to identify particular
23 behaviors that have been established in the literature to be
24 associated with the process of various tactics, such as
25 grooming and abuse by offenders.
