Pathways to False Allegations 105
In this situation, the controversy is not whether sexual content occurred but
whether consent for this sexual content occurred.

The final level of complexity regarding this pathway occurs in the
attempt of professionals involved in the case to accurately understand after
the fact the details of whatever consent process did or did not take place.
By its nature, this will generally be a “he said, she said” matter in which it is
very difficult to resolve conflicting claims. However, much can ride on the
heuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate matter.

A False Memory

The theory of repression, according to Freud (1910), posits that traumatic
memories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-
ten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a
lack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, 1993), many
psychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-
ries can be forgotten and later remembered (Boag, 2010). One psychological
process that may resemble repression is false memory.

The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of
controversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2009), and yet research does exist demon-
strating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first
studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short
narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,
and asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,
1996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood
stories about the participants. However, researchers created one fabricated
narrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.
a shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.
Participants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated
events over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later
whether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having
memories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-
bering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual
details and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have
successfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques
and scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, 1999; Hyman & Billings,
1998; Hyman & Pentland, 1996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, 1998).
Many of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to
those employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Watters,
1994, Pesant & Zadra, 2004).

It has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a
client to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, 1993). An example of this
type of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shows
signs of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try
