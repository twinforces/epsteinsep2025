First Element

Starting with the first clement, what:is a:conspiracy:? A conspiracy. is ‘an agreement or. an.
understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish, by joint, action.a criminal or
unlawful purpose.

The essence of the crime: of conspiracy is the unlawful. agreement between-two or:more:
people to violate the: law. As I mentioned carlicr, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning
crime of. conspiracy.

In, order'to show’ that:a Conspiracy’ cxisted, the cvidence must show that/two or:more’
people, in ‘some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that:is, spoken
or unspoken), came to.a:mutual ‘understanding to violate the law and, to accomplish an unlawful.
plan. Express language or spécific words are ‘not required to indicate. assent or attachment to, a
conspiracy. If'you.find beyond a:rcasonable doubt-that:two or more:persons ‘came to.an
understanding, express or implicd, to violate, the law and ‘to accomplish, an unlawful plan, then
the Government will have, sustained. its burden of. proof'as,to this. clement.

To'show that a-conspiracy existed, the Government is not required:to show that two or
more ‘people sat around a,table and entered into.a solemn pact, orally or in writing; stating’ that:
they:had formed.a conspiracy to violate-the law:and spelling ‘out all. of the. details. Common sense
tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enterinto a criminal conspiracy, ‘much is left-to the
unexpressed, understanding, It is rare that.a Conspiracy'can. bé proven by diréct.cvidence of an
explicit-agreement. Conspirators do not usually:reduce their agreements. to writing, or

acknowledge'them. before ‘a, notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast-their’plans.
