Denial of Consent
A key issue in sexual assault is whether consent was given for the sexual
contact. Consent is complex and, in real-world situations, may have signifi-
cant variability and may be rather subtle and, in general, an intricate process.
Rarely do sexual interactions begin with individuals explicitly stating “I give
you permission to do x, y, and z” (Hall, 1998). Consent in sexual situa-
tions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t
say no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or
“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and
Muehlenhard (1999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than
verbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knowledge of what is
being consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent
or not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s
“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret
differently. However, mistakes can be made in these situations and given
the motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be motivated (“I want this,
so I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;
I was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).

Understanding whether consent was given is made more complex by
the fact that consent early in the interaction for a certain kind of sexual
contact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.
In addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all
future contact. This complexity led to the infamous Antioch College consent
policy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and
every time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly
ask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,
1996):

If the level of sexual intimacy increases during an interaction (.e., if two

people move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to

undressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people
involved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that

new level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of

sexual intimacy in an interaction, that person is responsible for getting the

verbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.

(p. 137)

This policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it
raises the question how explicit and how often does consent need to be
conveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which
the alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be interpreted
as providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize
this. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe
consent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.
