because.an expert witness ‘may not “simply transmit,.... hearsay to the jury” or otherwise serve
as a'vchicle for the factual history of the case. United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d 179,197 (2d. Cir.
2008); seen re Fosamax,:645 F. Supp. 2d.at 192. Testifying. as'to specific suggestive activities
would,also likely violate the rule against expert testimony on'specific witnesses’ credibility.
Nimely, 4.14 F.3d at 398.

But'in its response bricf, the Defense states that.“[l]ikc Dr. Rocchio, [Dr. Loftus] would
be'testifying as a ‘blind?’ expert’ and so will not testify. about: any. particular witness in this case.
Def. Br. at 17. Based on this representation, the Court will admit Dr. Loftus’s opinion. on.the
general concepts of suggestive activities and falsc memory, ereation. The Defense may on cross-
examination ask'witnesses about activities or events that the Defense believes led. to false
memories. And. the jury may then.determine whether the general. concepts in. Dr. Loftus’s.
opinions are applicable to the evidence before: it:

Last, the Court clarifies 'that.this decision.as t6 Dr. Loftus is by no means an. invitation for
memory: experts to’be admitted. in cvery:future case. As: other federal courts have observed,
expert-testimony’ of this type is relevant; only‘in unusual. circumstances. See: Carter, 410 F.3d at
950; United States v. Redwood, 216 F. Supp. 3d 890, 899. (N.D. IIl..20.16) (“While in unique
circumstances expert testimony-regarding memory and perception may. be warranted, this is not,
one of those cases.”); Heine, 2017 WL 5260784, at. *2 (explaining that, other courts have
excluded memory experts “in. ordinary cases”). The Court finds this. case to be one such-unusual
circumstance, both because of the long period of time that has clapsed since the charged conduct

has admitted.the Government’s expert, Dr.‘Rocchio, who: expects to testify on, delayed. disclosure
