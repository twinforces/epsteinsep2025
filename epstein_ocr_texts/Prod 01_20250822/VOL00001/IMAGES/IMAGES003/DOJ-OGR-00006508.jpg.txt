AK’s recollections regarding February 29, 2016 Meeting:

e AK confirmed the handwritten notes sent to AK by LP were AK’s own notes from the
February 29, 2016 meeting.

e Inadvance of the meeting, AK remembers Pete Skinner reaching out to AK and asking if
he could come in to present on a potential case with some other attorneys. AK doesn’t
recall how Skinner contacted AK. Skinner was at Boies Schiller at the time, Skinner and
AK are friends and were in the SDNY USAO together. At this time, AK was the Human
Trafficking Coordinator and believes she was also the Project Safe Childhood
Coordinator.

e Meeting took place in a conference room at 1 St. Andrews Plaza USAO SDNY. Pete
Skinner, Brad Edwards, Stan Pottinger, and AK were at the meeting.

o AK doesn’t recall what each attorney’s role was, but her notes say that they
represented Virginia Roberts. AK also understood that Edwards was involved in
representing multiple individuals in a civil litigation involving the CVRA, but AK
is not certain of that.

o AK understood that Skinner or his colleagues at Boies were representing Virginia
Roberts. AK doesn’t know if Skinner was involved in representing Roberts.

o Brad Edwards did most of the talking during the meeting.

o AK recalls that Pete Skinner spoke a little bit, but AK doesn’t recall what, if
anything, he said on substance. AK doesn’t remember what he said.

e AK understood the purpose of the meeting to be the attorneys presenting information that
they believed or suggested should be the subject of a criminal investigation into Jeffrey
Epstein.

o AK understood that the attorneys were advocating that the Jeffrey Epstein case
should be investigated by SDNY.

e LP directed AK to references to lawsuits on pages 4 and 7 of AK’s notes from the
meeting, and asked what AK recalls about what civil lawsuits she learned of during the
meeting.

o AK remembers there was a CVRA lawsuit that was mentioned.

o AK remembers that there were other civil lawsuits mentioned. Aside from what
is in AK’s notes, AK has no memory of what those lawsuits were about or the
nature of those lawsuits.

o AK does not have an independent memory of the Guiffre v. Maxwell lawsuit
being mentioned, and her memory is not refreshed from looking at the notes.
