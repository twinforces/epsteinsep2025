witness encroaches upon, the jury’s vital, and.exclusive function to make credibility
déterminations and, therefore does riot *assist.the'tricr of fact’ as required, by Rule 702.”)
(citations omitted). Rocchio’s opinions.on disclosure also contravene:Rule 403. because they
‘suggest; that-dclayed:reporting of child sexual ‘abuse is more consistent with,truthfulness than,
with fabrication, a determination which ‘the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2010 WL
3734055, at *6.

That leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that:memory: and disclosure
of traumatic or abusive events is: impacted by. a ‘number of factors,, including the:circumstances
‘surrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also‘a:matter of
common. scns¢—how could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a numbcr'of factors”?
Moreover, Rocchio iis not.an expert inthe human.brain or memory generally. And her opinion
‘about when, why, and. how alleged victims of scxual assault:remember being assaulted suffers
from all. the same ‘flaws discussed above? Rocchio docsn’t'point to any data or studics’validating
her opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, ‘or meaningfully challenged; and her
opinion is based:on the self@reports of her own clicnts, who she assumes are telling the truth.

I. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing

For all these reasons, this. Court should preclude Rocchio ‘from testifying in this case. At
the very lcast, this Court should hold a. Daubert to evaluate cach.of her proposed opinions.

This, Court. should éxclude, Roéchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold.a.
Daubert hearing.
