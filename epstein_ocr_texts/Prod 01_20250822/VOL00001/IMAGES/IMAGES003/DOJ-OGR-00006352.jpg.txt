Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document435 Filed 11/11/21 Page11of11
pursuant to Rule 401 and not unduly prejudicial. As discussed, the jury may extrapolate from the
opinions that the presence of a third party creates the atmosphere of trust that can facilitate
grooming. Moreover, as the Government explains, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is still relevant
because the Government alleges both that Ms. Maxwell “in fact participated in sexual abuse of
minors” and that she “conspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors.”

Dkt. No. 397 at 27.

The Court therefore denies the Defense’s motion to exclude Dr. Rocchio’s testimony
except as to the opinion that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming.

This resolves docket number 386.
