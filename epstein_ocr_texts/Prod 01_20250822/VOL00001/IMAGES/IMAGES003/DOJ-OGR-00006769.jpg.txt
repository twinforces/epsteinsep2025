as the defense might like the Government to create such an index, that is simply not how the
litigation of co-conspirator statements is handled. And it is not what the Court’s order, requiring
“disclos[ur]e” of co-conspirator statements, required.

The Government’s obligation is to make disclosures. The Government is not obligated to
serve as members of the defense team, reviewing Jencks Act materials for the defense and
itemizing and indexing disclosures for them. The Government is no more obligated to itemize
Jencks Act materials containing co-conspirator statements than it is obligated to exhaustively detail
for the defense the basis for offering any other type of witness statement contained in the Jencks
Act material it has produced. Such an obligation would extremely burdensome and is both without
precedent and entirely unnecessary. The defense team has ample resources to review the
Government’s disclosures and file any motions they wish to make regarding the admission of
certain testimony. And there is ample time before trial for the defense to do so, and no basis in the
record to believe the defense will be unable to raise these issues and seek a ruling before trial.

The defense argues that the Court did order the Government to itemize co-conspirator
statements contained in its Jencks Act production. In support, however, the defense cites to orders
relating to the disclosure of the identities of co-conspirators. (Compare Def. Mot. 1 at 2 (citing
Dkt. No. 317 at 12 n.1) and Def. Mot. 1 at 3 (citing Dkt. No. 335 at 3) (stating that the Court
rejected the defendant’s arguments “because of ‘the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator
issues in advance of trial’” (emphasis in Def. Mot. 1)), with Op. & Order at 12 n.1, Dkt. No. 317
