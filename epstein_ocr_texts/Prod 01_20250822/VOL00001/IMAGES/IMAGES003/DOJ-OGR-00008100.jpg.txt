Re Of course, the government does not get to decide what
evidence is relevant, what relevant evidence Ms. Maxwell admits, or how Ms. Maxwell exercises
her constitutional rights to present a defense and to confrontation. If evidence is relevant, the
government does not get to dictate the terms of its admission, even if other evidence is “arguably
more relevant.” See White, 692 F.3d at 246 (“[U]nless an exception applies, all ‘relevant
evidence is admissible.’” (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 402)).

And the evidence is surely relevant. [x
