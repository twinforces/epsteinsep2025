precluding the term "victim" is both Unnecessary and
impractical. United States v. Dupigny, 18 CR 928, transcript
of OGtober 17, 2019, Docket No. 198 at 50. Tt is. appropriate
for the government to use the terms as representative of its
litigating position. If the government doés this, in any way
that is atypical er unduly prejudicial, I will revisit.
Defense only Gites otit-oOf -CircWit or State court
decisions for the proposition that these terms are -inherently

"taken as a whole clarify ‘the government."s burden of proving
all elements of the crime." United States vi. Washburn, 444
F.3d, 1007, 2113 (8th Cir. 20060); see also, Server v. Mizell,
902 F.2d 611, 615, (7th Cir. 1990); United Statés vs Granbois,

119 F.App"x, 35, 38-39 (9th Cir. 2004).

Defendant's lohe district Court S6pinioh does not. tip.

jury répedtedly that the defendant is presumed innocent and
that it is the government's burden, and the government's bunden,
alone to prové guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Those
instructions will eliminate any potential prejudice. See again
Judge Furman's décisid6n in Dupigny, Docket No; 198 at. 49

That. matter resolved, I will turn to the government's
first motion. This goes to pseudonyms. The government moves
