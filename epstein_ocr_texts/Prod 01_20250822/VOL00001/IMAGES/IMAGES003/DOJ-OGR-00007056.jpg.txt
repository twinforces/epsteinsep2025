1 precluding the term "victim" is both unnecessary and

2 impractical. United States v. Dupigny, 18 CR 528, transcript

3 of October 17, 2019, Docket No. 198 at 50. It is appropriate

4 for the government to use the terms as representative of its

5 litigating position. If the government does this in any way

6 that is atypical or unduly prejudicial, I will revisit.

7 Defense only cites out-of-circuit or state court

8 decisions for the proposition that those terms are inherently

9 prejudicial and harm the presumption of innocence. Numerous

10 courts of appeal disagree with that argument, particularly when
11 the presentation of evidence and the court's instructions

12 "taken as a whole clarify the government's burden of proving

13 all elements of the crime." United States v. Washburn, 444

14 F.3d, 1007, 1113 (8th Cir. 2006); see also, Server v. Mizell,
15 902 F.2d 611, 615, (7th Cir. 1990); United States v. Granbois,
16 119 F.App'x 35, 38-39 (9th Cir. 2004).

17 Defendant's lone district court opinion does not tip
18 the balance of this authority. I will, of course, instruct the
19 jury repeatedly that the defendant is presumed innocent and
20 that it is the government's burden and the government's burden
21 alone to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Those
22 instructions will eliminate any potential prejudice. See again
23 Judge Furman's decision in Dupigny, Docket No. 198 at 49
24 That matter resolved, I will turn to the government's
25 first motion. This goes to pseudonyms. The government moves
