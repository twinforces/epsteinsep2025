MEMORANDUM
Defendant. OPINION & ORDER
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Defense on December 12, 2021, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to
testify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a letter opposing this
request on December 14, 2021. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of
anonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permitted three alleged
victims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees
with this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.

“By convention, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to
the fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.
Such background gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to
steady the witness’s nerves.” 30 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence
§ 6408 (2d ed. 2021); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 691-92 (1931). That
presumption of identification is based, in part, on the “firmly established” principle that “the
press and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in
the First Amendment.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,
603 (1982). “There are rare instances, however, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...
inquiring into the witness’s identity and background.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 6408.
