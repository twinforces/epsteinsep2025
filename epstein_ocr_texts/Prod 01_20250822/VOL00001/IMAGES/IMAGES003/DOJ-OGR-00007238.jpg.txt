Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.467 Filed 11/15/21. Page 59 of 158 59,

LBAGmax2: Rocchio - Direct,

Q. I wanted to direct your attention to the use of the term
grooming, so in that top paragraph. If you could review the
section, of the article that. starts with "If their use of the
term. grooming" and all thé way to the end of that paragraph and
let. me know when, you. have had a chance to review it, please.
A. Okay.
Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response, reaction, to this
passage?
A. It"s a bit confusing as to the point that's being made. I
féel like they're trying to -- thé author heré seéms to bé
mixing different applications of the term that. they use
grooming, sq it looks like in part he's talking about, what is
true in the literature, which is that we're not particularly
good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and
predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we
can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.

And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is

used. to describe a process, a pattern of behaviors. I'm not

here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these
particular behaviors, yes, we Know you're a child abuser. So
he's making that point. But I don't think anybody -- I don't
think that -- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with,

that. Except that he's then going on —- I disagree where he

says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might. in

fact be prosocidl or normal.
