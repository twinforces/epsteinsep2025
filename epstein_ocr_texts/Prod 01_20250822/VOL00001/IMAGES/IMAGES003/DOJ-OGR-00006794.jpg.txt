The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual
Abuse: Conceptual and Measurement Issues

There bave been claims that some child molesters engage in a

“seduction stage” prior to committing abuse. These bebaviors, com-

monly known as “grooming,” are understood as methods child

molesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-

pliant with abuse. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding
exactly what this process entails and how it is clearly distinguished
from normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an
accurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic
purposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal
problematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of
known psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe
empirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and
propose future directions for research.

Understanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both
its prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &
Johnson, 1989; Burgess & Holmstrom, 1980; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, 1989,
Elliott, Browne, & Kilcoyne, 1995) agree that a type of seduction stage,
commonly called “grooming” but also variously known as “entrapment,”
“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.
Offenders have admitted that they use techniques such as identifying a par-
ticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare
the child for the abuse (Seto, 2008).

Understanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-
tions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming
