1 by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of

2 Florida, (3) about the scope and timeline of investigation in

3 New York, and (4) other evidence that demonstrates the

4 government's motives for investigating Ms. Maxwell.

a The Court's analysis here is guided by four principles
6 set by the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court.

7 First, because the government has no duty to employ,

8 in the course of a single investigation, any particular

9 investigative technique, the failure to utilize some particular
10 technique does not tend to show that a defendant is not guilty
11 of the crime of which he's been charged and is therefore

12 irrelevant. United States v. Saldarriaga, 204 F.3d 50, (2d

13 Cir. 2000). That's the first legal principle that frames the
14 discussion here.

15 Second, arguments that the government had an improper
16 motive generally must be directed to the Court rather than the
17 jury. United States v. Regan, 103 F.3d 1072, (2d Cir. 1997);
18 see also, United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d 127 (2d Cir.

19 2011).
20 Third legal principle: There is no per se bar on
21 admitting evidence of the government's charging decisions.
22 Rather, the Court must -- I will quote here -- "inquire into
23 its relevance and probative value to the respective case."
24 United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235 (2d Cir. 2012); see also,
25 United States v. Ngono, 801 F.App'x. 19 (2d Cir. 2020).
