cess (at p. 142-143), but do not use the term “grooming.”

Figure 1 shows how the maximum number of publications in the database
using the term “grooming” for this meaning! has increased since 1984. For
the remainder of the 1980s, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-

to 63, and from 2000 to 2009, from 64 to 227. From 2010 to 2016, the annual
frequency rose from 282 to 533.

My own recollection of the growing use of the term “grooming” in this

has been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or
what might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does
