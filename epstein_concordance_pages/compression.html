Thomas explained that when he first entered Epstein’s cell,\nFigure 5.3 Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a sheet or a\nshirt, around his neck. The end of the string was tied to the\nPhotograph of a Piece of Orange Cloth _ top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended from the\nHanging from the Bunkbed in top bunk in a near-seated position, with his butocks\nEpstein’s Cell Follouing His Death approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his\nlegs extended out straight on the floor. Thomas said Epstein\ndid not look discolored or very different from when he last\nsaw Epstein alive. Thomas said he immediately ripped the\norange sheet or shirt away from the bunkbed, and Epstein’s\nbutocks dropped approximately l inch to l inch and a half to\nthe ground. Thomas then louered Epstein’s entire body to\nthe floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was\n. breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest\ncompressions until responding MCC New York staff members\narrived approximately l minute later. Thomas said he did not\nprovide rescue breaths and was unaware if Epstein was dead\n\\ : or alive because he never checked for a pulse before initiating\nchest compressions. Thomas said medical personnel took\n| over the emergency response, including chest compressions\nand use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when\nthey arrived. Thomas said he assisted with bringing Epstein\ndoun to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and\nthat he left MCC New York at approximately 8 a.m. Thomas\nsaid he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\ntraining during MCC New York annual refresher training and\nhad responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this\nwas the first time he was the first responder.\nSource: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Thomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on\nCity of New York August lo, 2ol9, from l2 a.m. until the time he atempted to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:3o a.m. and\ndid not see anyone go inside Epstein’s cell during his shift. Thomas said that he would have knoun if\nsomeone went in or out of Epstein’s cell and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see\nEpstein’s cell door from the SHU Officers’ Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage\npoint. Thomas said that it was not possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knouledge\nbecause he or Noel would have had to open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to\nthe SHU was located elsewhere in the institution; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys\nrequired to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, Thomas said that anyone atempting to access the L Tier\nwhere Epstein was located would have had to walk directly in front of the SHU Officers’ Station where\nThomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that he or Noel had any role in Epstein’s death.\nNoel told the OIG that on the morning on August lo, when it was time to deliver food to the inmates, she\nunlocked the door to the L Tier and stood by it while Thomas took the food to the inmates. Noel said that\nwhen Thomas knocked on Epstein’s door, there was no response. Noel said Epstein’s cell door was locked,\nso Thomas used a key to open it and went inside. Noel heard Thomas call out for her to retrieve the cuter\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023446.jpg": "follouing suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while\nInmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual <span class=\"highlight\">compression</span> of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete <span class=\"highlight\">compression</span> as opposed to a\nsustained <span class=\"highlight\">compression</span> like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024964.jpg": "Page 5o7\nBureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nClinical Encounter\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o8/lo/2ol9 o7:25 Provider: pa RN Unit: Zo4\nEmergency Code - Resuscitation Event encounter performed at Special Housing Unit.\nSUBJECTIVE:\nEmergency Note Provider: fexevoxrcr RN\nTeam Members:\nProvider Role\nRN Team/Code Leader\nCode Events:\nType Value Date\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o6:35\nEKG/Monitor Lifepak o8/lo/2ol9 o6:39\nNo shock advised\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o6:4o\nOxygen l5L o8/lo/2ol9 o6:47\nIV Access Peripheral IV o8/lo/2ol9 o6:48\nl8 g Left AC\nAirway Endotracheal Tube o8/lo/2ol9 o7:o8\nET Tube 7.5 24CM to L Lip line Placed by Paramedics\nMedications Epinephrine lmg IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:lo\nEpinephrine 3 doses and Sodium bicarb 2 doses administered by paramedics\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o7:ll\nMedications Sodium Bicarbonate l mEa/kg IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:ll\nIV Fluids Normal Saline o.9% looo ml o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l2\nMedications Epinephrine lmg IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l3\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l4\nMedications Sodium Bicarbonate l mEa/kg IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l4\nMedications Epinephrine img IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l6\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l7\nComments:\nResponded to ar | at o635 for medical emergency on 9S, Upon arrival Inmate was received on the floor of his\ncell unresponsive with CPR in progress by correctional officers, Inmate was Cold, with circumferential Bruising around the\nneck and posterior motling, Pupils Fixed and dilated, No Palpable pulses, Call place for EMS, CPR Continued, AED\nPlaced No shock advised, CPR Continued, inmate transported to HSU treatment room with CPR in progress, l8g hep lock\nto LAC, Oo2 l5 Lt ViA BVM, Pulse Check NO SHOCK advised.
