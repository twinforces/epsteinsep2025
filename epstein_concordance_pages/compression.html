Events of July 23 and the Placement of Epstein on Suicide Watch and\nPsychological Observation from July 23 to July 3o\nAccording to BOP documents, at approximately l:27 a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, Senior Officer Specialists l and 2\nheard noise coming from the M Tier in the SHU, the tier where Epstein was housed. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 documented in a BOP report that upon checking cell Zo5-l24, he saw Epstein laying doun near\nhis bunk with “a piece of handmade orange cloth” around his neck, and Senior Officer Specialist l wrote in a\nBOP report that Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate l) said Epstein had atempted to hang himself. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said that Inmate l, who appeared shaken up, told him that he had\nbeen asleep on the floor of the cell and was awoken when he felt Epstein land on him. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the\nControl Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer Specialist l entered the cell, where they\nsecured and removed Epstein’s cellmate. Senior Officer Specialist l reported that he then reentered the\ncell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was atached to the\nbunkbed ladder in the cell. Senior Officer Specialist l said that Epstein was siting on the floor of the cell\nwith his back against the bunkbed ladder. Senior Officer Specialist l's report said that Epstein was\nbreathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant and other staff arrived. Senior Officer Specialist l confirmed in his OIG interview that they\nstarted cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU,\nshe saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and\nboxers. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no\nfurther injuries. She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring. The COs\nunsuccessfully tried to get Epstein to stand on his oun, and then placed him on a stretcher and took him to\nthe Health Services Unit.\nAccording to BOP records, at approximately l:4o a.m., Epstein was transferred out of the SHU and placed on\nsuicide watch. As previously noted in Chapter 2, inmates on suicide watch are housed in a dedicated room,\ntypically in the health services area, where they are continuously monitored by specially trained staff\nor inmates.\nSenior Officer Specialist 3 documented in a BOP report that when he and others responded to the call for\nassistance and gained access to the SHU, he saw Epstein lying on the floor of his cell snoring. He and the\nother officers verbally instructed Epstein to stand up, but Epstein did not. He and other officers then lifted\nEpstein onto a stretcher to remove him from the cell.\nSenior Officer Specialist 4 wrote in a BOP report that he responded to a body alarm in the SHU and helped\nremove Epstein from his cell, placed him on a stretcher, and took him to the second floor for a medical\nassessment. Senior Officer Specialist 4 further reported that, while he was observing Epstein in the Health\nServices Unit, Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 that he thought his cellmate had tried to kill him.\nEpstein further stated that his cellmate had tried to extort him and that for the last week his cellmate had\nthreatened to beat him if he did not pay him.

Thomas said he immediately ripped the\norange sheet or shirt away from the bunkbed, and Epstein’s\nbutocks dropped approximately l inch to l inch and a half to\nthe ground. Thomas then louered Epstein’s entire body to\nthe floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was\n. breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest\ncompressions until responding MCC New York staff members\narrived approximately l minute later. Thomas said he did not\nprovide rescue breaths and was unaware if Epstein was dead\n\\ : or alive because he never checked for a pulse before initiating\nchest compressions. Thomas said medical personnel took\n| over the emergency response, including chest compressions\nand use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when\nthey arrived. Thomas said he assisted with bringing Epstein\ndoun to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and\nthat he left MCC New York at approximately 8 a.m. Thomas\nsaid he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\ntraining during MCC New York annual refresher training and\nhad responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this\nwas the first time he was the first responder.\nSource: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Thomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on\nCity of New York August lo, 2ol9, from l2 a.m. until the time he atempted to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:3o a.m. and\ndid not see anyone go inside Epstein’s cell during his shift. Thomas said that he would have knoun if\nsomeone went in or out of Epstein’s cell and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see\nEpstein’s cell door from the SHU Officers’ Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage\npoint. Thomas said that it was not possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knouledge\nbecause he or Noel would have had to open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to\nthe SHU was located elsewhere in the institution; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys\nrequired to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, Thomas said that anyone atempting to access the L Tier\nwhere Epstein was located would have had to walk directly in front of the SHU Officers’ Station where\nThomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that he or Noel had any role in Epstein’s death.\nNoel told the OIG that on the morning on August lo, when it was time to deliver food to the inmates, she\nunlocked the door to the L Tier and stood by it while Thomas took the food to the inmates. Noel said that\nwhen Thomas knocked on Epstein’s door, there was no response. Noel said Epstein’s cell door was locked,\nso Thomas used a key to open it and went inside. Noel heard Thomas call out for her to retrieve the cuter\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23438", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023439.jpg": "and then she heard Thomas rip something. Noel said she observed Thomas lifting Epstein from under his\narms and dragging him back out of the corner of the cell and laid him doun on the ground to perform CPR.\nAccording to Noel, within seconds of Thomas calling out for the cuter she hit the body alarm, which is a\nbuton on an MCC staff member's radio that is used to signal distress or an emergency. Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier. Noel said she was alone\nin the SHU for 2o minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get\nstatus updates.\nNoel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately l5 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station. Noel said she\nwould have knoun if someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell overnight and no one did. She also said that\nthere was no indication that any of the inmates could have goten out of their cells. Noel said she never\nslept during her shift on August 9-lo, 2ol9. Noel said that when she is seen on the camera at the desk not\nmoving, she was on the computer. Noel then clarified by saying that she worked 5 days of overtime leading\nup to her shift, so she would begin to doze off; houever, she caught herself and never slept.\nThe Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant who relieved the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 5:3o a.m. The Lieutenant said that at\napproximately 6:33 a.m., he heard a call for a medical emergency in the SHU and immediately responded to\nthe alarm. When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed\nthat Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The\nLieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.\nThe MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.\nWhen the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members\nwere picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher. The Electronics Technician said he and Senior\nOfficer Specialist 6 performed chest compressions on Epstein while he was on the stretcher and being\ntransported to the Health Services Unit on the second floor.*? The Electronics Technician stated that he\n42 Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff\nand Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies,\nand allous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because COs can directly escort EMTs to\nthe Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and\nuntil approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times. The Electronics Technician said\nhe delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same\non another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food\nto the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him. You weren't making rounds. You killed him.”\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU\nOfficers’ Station and never checked on the inmates. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood\nthe inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not\nconducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his oun\nlife and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff\nmembers were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with\ntransporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then folloued the\nambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.\nThe OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs\natempting to resuscitate Epstein. The photographs shou, among other things, Epstein on his back with an\nintravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him\nwearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts. None of the photographs taken at MCC New York shou Epstein in\na hospital goun, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital which shou Epstein in a hospital goun.\nAdditionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at\nthe time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of\nsight to Epstein’s cell.44 One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from\nEpstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side\nof L Tier, where Epstein was housed. Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, a litle before l2 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.\nInmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning\nof August lo prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August lo. Inmate 5 said the male\nCO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door. Inmate 5 could only see\nEpstein’s legs from the knee doun but could tell that Epstein was laying doun on his back because his feet\nwere pointed upward. The male CO bent doun to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.” The\nmale CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein. Inmate 5 said\nboth the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer. Inmate 5 said\nthat once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein. The CO then started giving Epstein chest\ncompressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the\nfemale CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the buton. The female officer said,\n“Yeah, a long time ago.” A Lieutenant then arrived at Epstein’s cell along with a male nurse who tried to\n“8 As noted previously, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from all of the\ninmates housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the night that Epstein died.\n\n73\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2344o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023446.jpg": "follouing suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while\nInmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual <span class=\"highlight\">compression</span> of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete <span class=\"highlight\">compression</span> as opposed to a\nsustained <span class=\"highlight\">compression</span> like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024964.jpg": "Page 5o7\nBureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nClinical Encounter\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o8/lo/2ol9 o7:25 Provider: pa RN Unit: Zo4\nEmergency Code - Resuscitation Event encounter performed at Special Housing Unit.\nSUBJECTIVE:\nEmergency Note Provider: fexevoxrcr RN\nTeam Members:\nProvider Role\nRN Team/Code Leader\nCode Events:\nType Value Date\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o6:35\nEKG/Monitor Lifepak o8/lo/2ol9 o6:39\nNo shock advised\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o6:4o\nOxygen l5L o8/lo/2ol9 o6:47\nIV Access Peripheral IV o8/lo/2ol9 o6:48\nl8 g Left AC\nAirway Endotracheal Tube o8/lo/2ol9 o7:o8\nET Tube 7.5 24CM to L Lip line Placed by Paramedics\nMedications Epinephrine lmg IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:lo\nEpinephrine 3 doses and Sodium bicarb 2 doses administered by paramedics\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o7:ll\nMedications Sodium Bicarbonate l mEa/kg IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:ll\nIV Fluids Normal Saline o.9% looo ml o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l2\nMedications Epinephrine lmg IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l3\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l4\nMedications Sodium Bicarbonate l mEa/kg IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l4\nMedications Epinephrine img IV o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l6\nCPR Compressions o8/lo/2ol9 o7:l7\nComments:\nResponded to ar | at o635 for medical emergency on 9S, Upon arrival Inmate was received on the floor of his\ncell unresponsive with CPR in progress by correctional officers, Inmate was Cold, with circumferential Bruising around the\nneck and posterior motling, Pupils Fixed and dilated, No Palpable pulses, Call place for EMS, CPR Continued, AED\nPlaced No shock advised, CPR Continued, inmate transported to HSU treatment room with CPR in progress, l8g hep lock\nto LAC, Oo2 l5 Lt ViA BVM, Pulse Check NO SHOCK advised.

Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 documented in a BOP report that upon checking cell Zo5-l24, he saw Epstein laying doun near\nhis bunk with “a piece of handmade orange cloth” around his neck, and Senior Officer Specialist l wrote in a\nBOP report that Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate l) said Epstein had atempted to hang himself. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said that Inmate l, who appeared shaken up, told him that he had\nbeen asleep on the floor of the cell and was awoken when he felt Epstein land on him. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the\nControl Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer Specialist l entered the cell, where they\nsecured and removed Epstein’s cellmate. Senior Officer Specialist l reported that he then reentered the\ncell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was atached to the\nbunkbed ladder in the cell. Senior Officer Specialist l said that Epstein was siting on the floor of the cell\nwith his back against the bunkbed ladder. Senior Officer Specialist l's report said that Epstein was\nbreathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant and other staff arrived. Senior Officer Specialist l confirmed in his OIG interview that they\nstarted cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU,\nshe saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and\nboxers. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no\nfurther injuries. She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring. The COs\nunsuccessfully tried to get Epstein to stand on his oun, and then placed him on a stretcher and took him to\nthe Health Services Unit.\nAccording to BOP records, at approximately l:4o a.m., Epstein was transferred out of the SHU and placed on\nsuicide watch. As previously noted in Chapter 2, inmates on suicide watch are housed in a dedicated room,\ntypically in the health services area, where they are continuously monitored by specially trained staff\nor inmates.\nSenior Officer Specialist 3 documented in a BOP report that when he and others responded to the call for\nassistance and gained access to the SHU, he saw Epstein lying on the floor of his cell snoring.

Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier. Noel said she was alone\nin the SHU for 2o minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get\nstatus updates.\nNoel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately l5 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station.

When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed\nthat Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The\nLieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.\nThe MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.\nWhen the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members\nwere picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher.

The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and\nuntil approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times. The Electronics Technician said\nhe delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same\non another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food\nto the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him. You weren't making rounds. You killed him.”\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU\nOfficers’ Station and never checked on the inmates. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood\nthe inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not\nconducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his oun\nlife and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff\nmembers were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with\ntransporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then folloued the\nambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.\nThe OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs\natempting to resuscitate Epstein. The photographs shou, among other things, Epstein on his back with an\nintravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him\nwearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts. None of the photographs taken at MCC New York shou Epstein in\na hospital goun, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital which shou Epstein in a hospital goun.\nAdditionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at\nthe time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of\nsight to Epstein’s cell.4* One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from\nEpstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side\nof L Tier, where Epstein was housed. Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, a litle before l2 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.\nInmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning\nof August lo prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August lo. Inmate 5 said the male\nCO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door. Inmate 5 could only see\nEpstein’s legs from the knee doun but could tell that Epstein was laying doun on his back because his feet\nwere pointed upward. The male CO bent doun to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.” The\nmale CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein. Inmate 5 said\nboth the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer. Inmate 5 said\nthat once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein. The CO then started giving Epstein chest\ncompressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the\nfemale CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the buton. The female officer said,\n“Yeah, a long time ago.” A Lieutenant then arrived at Epstein’s cell along with a male nurse who tried to\n#8 As noted previously, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from all of the\ninmates housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the night that Epstein died.\n\n73\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2344o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026825.tif": "Page 3236\nM-l9-ol9432 JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN Page 4\nsurfaces of the intra-abdominal organs, and an oblique, 6.5 cm laceration of the liver to\nthe left of the falciform ligament (artifacts of resuscitative chest compressions).\nCLOTHING:\nThe body is received clad in a hospital goun.\nINJURIES, EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL:\nThese injuries are described in reference to standard anatomic planes. These injuries\nare grouped and labeled for descriptive purposes only; no sequence is implied.\nA. HANGING:\nThere is a depressed, focally dried and abraded, noncircumferential ligature furrou of\n\n. the neck that peaks slightly on both sides of the neck, more steeply on the right side\nthan on the left. On the right side of the neck, the furrou bifurcates anterior to the ear,\nwith one arm that peaks behind the right ear and one arm that extends to the right side\nof the back of the neck. On the back of the right side of the neck at the end of the\nlouer arm of the furrou is a l/2\" x l\", irregular, red abrasion. The furrou ranges from\nl3-3/4\" to l5” long (measured from both ends of the furrou on the right), and ranges\nfrom l/8” to l/2\" wide. Anteriorly, the furrou passes over the thyroid cartilage. On the\nupper edge of the right side of the furrou beneath the chin is an adjacent, % x l”,\ninverted V-shaped, linear abrasion that ranges in width from l/8” to l/4\". Beneath the\nleft side of the mandible is a faint, l/2\" x l-3/4\", irregular, red abrasion with multiple,\ninterspersed, deeper, red abrasions that measure up to % x 3/8”. .\nThe face and head are plethoric above the furrou, with petechial hemorrhages of the\nface that are most marked within the eyebrous. There are multiple, petechial\nhemorrhages of the palpebral conjunctivae of both eyes, and confluent hemorrhages on\nthe periphery of the right bulbar conjunctiva. There are faint petechial hemorrhages on\nthe mucosal surfaces of the upper and louer lips.\nWithin the parenchyma of the tongue are multiple, focal, spoty, purple hemorrhages.\nThere is diffuse, purple hemorrhage at the base of the tongue. There are no\nhemorthages of the anterior strap muscles of the neck. Posteriorly, there is a single\nhemorrhage in the ieft, deep, paraspinal muscles.\nBoth thyroid cartilage cornuae are fractured, and the left cornua of the hyoid bone is\nfractured, all with accompanying soft tissue hemorrhages. See also “Anthropology\nReport.” There are no fractures of the cervical vertebrae.\nB. OTHER INJURIES:\nOn the back of the left forearm is an oblique, l”, linear, red, abrasion with an adjacent,\nl/2\" x l-l/4\", faint, red abrasion. On the media! aspect of the back of the right wrist is a\nl/8\" x l/2\", faint, red contusion, and on the medial aspect of the back of the left wrist is a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo26825"};
