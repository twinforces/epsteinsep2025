By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body.

While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated interstate or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose.

The\nfacts of this case fall far outside the scenarios that Congress and the Sentencing Commission\nwere trying to address with § 4Bl.5. Here, the government concedes that the defendant is nota\ndanger to the public, there is no evidence that the defendant herself is sexually atracted to\nminors, the conduct that gives rise to the <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> ended almost 2o years ago, and there is no\nevidence that the defendant has re-offended and no concern that she will ever re-offend.\nMoreover, the application of § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would lead to absurd results that the\nSentencing Commission did not contemplate. Section 4Bl.5 therefore does not apply.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel5 of 29\n\nA, Ms. Maxwell Does Not Present a Continuing Danger to the Public.\n\nIt is clear from the Guidelines commentary and the Congressional intent underlying the\ncreation of § 4Bl.5 that the <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> does not apply to Ms. Maxwell. The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator.... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly\nhigh — released rapists are lo times more likely to repeat their crime than other\ncriminals. The Congress has a responsibility to address the issue by passing a\nbill that would put an end to this cycle of violence repeated by a single\nperpetrator.” Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of l998,\nHearing Before the House Judiciary Commitee, Subcommitee on Crime, lo5\"\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo432", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l6 of 29\nCong.

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the community because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison.

The <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> is typically applied to defendants (virtually\nall of whom are male) who repeatedly and often violently sexually abuse or exploit children for\ntheir oun sexual gratification and who are caught soon after or while still engaging in that\nbehavior. See, e.g., Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 284-88; United States v. Suarez, No. 2l-l72l, 2o22\nWL l449l74, at *l-*2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2o22); United States v.

Feb. l, 2o22).\n\nIn sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell has never been accused of any sex offenses—or any\ncrimes, for that mater—in the almost 2o-year period since the conduct at issue in this case\nended. There is absolutely no evidence that Ms. Maxwell is atracted to minors or has the sort of\nuncontrollable impulses that would compel her to re-offend. According to the trial record, it was\nEpstein who had such proclivities, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was to facilitate Epstein’s sexual\nabuse. Indeed, after she moved on from Epstein in the early 2ooos, Ms. Maxwell was involved\nin two long-term relationships with men who had young children and was actively involved in\ntheir lives without even the slightest hint of impropriety. Most importantly, the government\nconcedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community. The government never made that\nassertion in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous bail applications and there is no evidence\nwhatsoever to support such a claim. Put simply, Ms. Maxwell is not “dangerous” and there is no\nrisk that Ms. Maxwell will ever “repeat” the offense. Accordingly, there is no basis to apply\n§ 4Bl.5, which is meant to apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.\n\nThe government asserts that § 4Bl.5 should apply as long as the offense conduct fits\nwithin the text of the guideline, to which it claims to be faithfully adhering. See PSR at 6o. It is\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo434", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l8 of 29\nnot. The government ignores the background commentary to § 4Bl.5, which explicitly states\nthat the <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the\npublic.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing so, the government\nrejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper\ninterpretation and application of § 4Bl.5. See Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 38 (l993)\n(“[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative\nunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly\nerroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing\nCommission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and\nthe explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over lo years\nto her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a\ndanger to the community and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.\n\nB. Applying § 4Bl.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is\nsignificantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of\ndefendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4Bl.5.\nThe Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously\nabsurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 24o, 246 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nSection 4Bl.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been\nconvicted of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants\nwho have not been convicted of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(b)). As discussed above, the\npurpose of the Act and § 4Bl.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders. It\nfollous that convicted sex offenders who re-offend after being released from prison should\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo435", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2o of 29\n552 U.S. 85, lo8-o9 (2oo7) (“[A] district court may vary from the Guidelines range based solely\non a policy disagreement with the Guidelines, even where that disagreement applies to a wide\nclass of offenders or offenses.”). Section 4Bl.5 should therefore not apply.\nTil. Ms. Maxwell Does Not Qualify for an Aggravating Role <span class=\"highlight\">Adjustment</span> Under USSG §\n3BLL.\n\nA. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Supervise Another Criminal Participant.\n\nUnder the plain language of USSG § 3Bl.l and its commentary, Ms. Maxwell does not\nqualify for an aggravating role enhancement. The Guidelines are clear that for any of the three\naggravating role enhancements to apply, the Court must first find that Ms. Maxwell supervised at\nleast one other criminal participant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2 (“To qualify for an\n<span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or\nsupervisor of one or more other participants.” (emphasis added)); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d\nl46, l56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2). A “participant” is defined as “‘a person\nwho is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been\nconvicted.” USSG § 3Bl.l cmt. n.l; Skys, 637 F.3d at l56.\n\nThere is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offenses against “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn, which form the basis for the\nthree offense groups in the PSR. See PSR 4] 89-9o.” According to the trial testimony, the only\ncriminal participants in the offenses involving “Jane” and Annie Farmer were Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. There is certainly no support in the record that Ms. Maxwell supervised Epstein. In\nfact, the record is clear that the opposite is true: Epstein directed and managed Ms. Maxwell,\n\n7 Because the Court ruled that “Kate” is not a victim of the offenses of conviction, Probation and the government\nagree that the conduct related to “Kate” cannot be treated as a separate offense group and is not subject to a\nGuidelines analysis. See PSR at 58-59. We therefore do not address the application of any enhancements or\nadjustments based on evidence related to “Kate.” Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell\nsupervised another criminal participant in her offense conduct.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo437", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 27 of 29\nMultiple Count <span class=\"highlight\">Adjustment</span>\nGroup/Count Adjusted Offense Level Units\nGroup l Zl l.o\nGroup 2 l9 l.o\nGroup 3 2l l.o\nTotal Number of Units: 3.o\nGreater of the Adjusted Offense Levels Above: 2l\nIncrease in Offense Level: +3\nCombined Adjusted Offense Level: 24\nTotal Offense Level: 24\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should apply the 2oo3 Guidelines, which yield a\nproperly calculated sentencing range of 5l-63 months.

Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the application of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise extensive.” The defense correctly points out that Application Note 2 to this\nGuidelines provides, “To qualify for an <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management\nresponsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Application Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been convicted.” Despite those Application Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise extensive” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise extensive” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” enhancement applies.

This high level of political integration existing between the\nMember States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these\nStates in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> of penalty methods; the\nmember states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising\nfrom the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and\nfrom the case law of the European Court of Human Rights).\n\nIn any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from\nwhich France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.\n\nOffice for the International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Maters\nPhilippe JAEGLE\n[signature]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2olo2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020423.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page37 of 9l\nserious allegations leveled by MDC legal counsel and defense counsel in no way\nundermine the Courts conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers are fully able to\nprepare for trial.

The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the\nCourt can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial\ncommencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in\nadvance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall\nmeet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The\nparties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone\nregarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4,\n2o2l.

Under Count Four, it was necessary to prove that Defendant caused Jane to\ntravel to New York with the intent that she would engage in illegal sexual activity\nthat violated New York Penal Law §l3o.55. A juror note plainly indicated that the\njury believed that the sexual activity intended need not have occurred in New\nYork. But the court refused to correct the jurors’ misunderstanding, merely\ndirecting them to the charge which they had in their possession and to which they\nwere already plainly referring when they asked about the “second element” of\n“count four.” Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico, to which the\nNote referred, presented the jury with an alternative basis for conviction that was\nentirely distinct from the charges in the Indictment.

On February 28, 2o23, Maxwell filed her opening brief on appeal,\nwhich contains approximately l9,95o words.\n\nl4.

MAXWELL\nThe Government defends the Court’s decision to apply a four-level leadership\nenhancement under Section 3Bl.l of the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the trial\nevidence did not support a finding that Ms. Maxwell was an “organizer or leader of\na criminal activity that was...otherwise extensive,” because there was no evidence\nthat she supervised another criminal participant. Specifically, the court’s finding that\nMs. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen, who the Government claimed was a criminal\nparticipant but chose not to indict, is unsupported by the record. See Br. 77. This\nerror coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(c)(2), requires that Ms. Maxwell be resentenced.\nTo qualify for an <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> under this section, the defendant must have been\nthe organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. See\nUSSG Section 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The Government at sentencing correctly conceded\nthat there was no direct evidence that Maxwell supervised Kellen. A4o6.

As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the\nOIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that,\nweather and resources permiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters\n5 hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the\nopportunity to shouer at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates\nmay also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court\nappearances, medical and psychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all\nvisitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on\nwork details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought\ninto a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the\ninmate's locked cell door.\nBOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 3o continuous calendar days are to be examined\nand interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> and the threat\npresented to self or others.\nBOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other\nthings, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit. When a staff\nmember is assigned to the SHU at the last-minute and has not completed the quarterly training, the staff\nmember must be advised of the general requirements of a SHU post and be permited to ask questions\nabout the duties.\n2. Inmate Accountability”\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted. MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that\ncounts must occur at l2 a.m., 3.a.m., 5.a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at lo p.m.\ndaily and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates\nwhile the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier. This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count\nin the same manner. When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate's body and\nnot rely solely on movement or sound. Officers conducting the count relay the count verbally to the Control\nThis section describes inmate accountability measures that are most relevant to this investigation and review.

As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the\nOIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that,\nweather and resources permiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters\n5 hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the\nopportunity to shouer at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates\nmay also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court\nappearances, medical and psychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all\nvisitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on\nwork details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought\ninto a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the\ninmate's locked cell door.\nBOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 3o continuous calendar days are to be examined\nand interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's <span class=\"highlight\">adjustment</span> and the threat\npresented to self or others.\nBOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other\nthings, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit. When a staff\nmember is assigned to the SHU at the last-minute and has not completed the quarterly training, the staff\nmember must be advised of the general requirements of a SHU post and be permited to ask questions\nabout the duties.\n2. Inmate Accountability\"\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted. MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that\ncounts must occur at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at lo p.m.\ndaily and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates\nwhile the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier. This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count\nin the same manner. When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate's body and\nnot rely solely on movement or sound. Officers conducting the count relay the count verbally to the Control\nThis section describes inmate accountability measures that are most relevant to this investigation and review. The\nBOP utilizes a variety of other security and inmate accountability tools in addition to those discussed in this section,\nwhich are described in BOP Program Statement 55oo.l4, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23376"};
