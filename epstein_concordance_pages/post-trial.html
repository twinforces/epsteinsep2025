In other words, Count One requires proof of an\nagreement to transport, while Count Three requires proof of an agreement to entice. Transportation\ndoes not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily\nrequire transportation. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2ooo WL l253265, at\n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 transportation charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to transport one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not\nagree to actually transport or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\nconspiracy count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the\ndiscretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature.

With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe parties respectfully submit this joint leter proposing a schedule for sentencing and\nresolution of the severed perjury counts, as directed by the Court. (Dkt. No. 567). This schedule\nis in addition to the Court’s schedule for <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions, established by separate order. (Dkt.\nNo. 57l).\n\nGovernment Position\n\nThe Government believes that the Court should order preparation of the Presentence\nInvestigation Report (“PSR”) and schedule a sentencing proceeding approximately three to four\nmonths from today’s date. That schedule permits sufficient time for the preparation of the PSR\nand resolution of <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions.\n\nIn the event the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions are denied, the Government is prepared to\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document574 Filed ol/lo/22 Page2of3\ndismiss the severed perjury counts at the time of sentencing, in light of the victims’ significant\ninterests in bringing closure to this mater and avoiding the trauma of testifying again.\n\nIf any of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions are granted, the Government proposes that the\nparties be directed to promptly confer and propose a schedule for further proceedings. That\nschedule may depend on the manner in which the Court resolves such motions.\n\nDefense Position\n\nThe defense requests that the Court delay seting a schedule for sentencing because there\nis a compelling basis for the Court to overturn Ms. Maxwell’s conviction and grant her a new trial\nbased on the disclosures of Juror #5o during deliberations. The parties are currently briefing that\nissue. The defense therefore objects to seting a schedule for sentencing until this motion is\nresolved. For the same reason, the defense intends to set forth in its moving papers the reasons\nwhy Ms. Maxwell should not be forced to expend resources to brief other <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions until\nafter the Court decides this motion.\n\nFurthermore, requiring Ms. Maxwell to participate in the preparation of the Presentence\nInvestigation Report, while she is awaiting a decision on her motion for a new trial, will adversely\nimpact her Fifth Amendment rights. Ms. Maxwell will be forced into the position of not\ncooperating with the Probation Department’s investigation because any statement she makes to\nProbation, and any documents she provides, may be used against her at her retrial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document574 Filed ol/lo/22 Page3of3\nFor the same reasons, the defense agrees with the government that the scheduling of any\nproceedings related to the perjury counts should be deferred until the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions are\nresolved.\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\nBy: ___s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nCc: Defense Counsel (by ECF)\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document576 Filed ol/l4/22 Page2of2\n\nFinally, in an abundance of caution, the Court assumes that while these issues are being\nbriefed and resolved the parties are in full compliance with the law of the Second Circuit\nrequiring notice and the Court’s permission before any contact with jurors.

Bernstein, 8l4 F.3d at\nl43-45; see also Press-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4.\n\nDefendant's Motion for New Trial. Parties’ motions, briefs, and\naccompanying exhibits related to <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> proceedings have regularly\nbeen found to be subject to the constitutional right of access, especially\nwhen they involve allegations of jury misconduct. See, e.g., United States\nv. Simone, l4 F.3d 833, 84o (3d Cir. l994); United States v. Gonzalez, 927\nF. Supp. 768, 782 (D. Del. l996); see also CBS, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for\nCent. Dist. of Cal., 765 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir. l985). As with the\ncommon law right, the constitutional right guarantees “immediate access\nwhere a right of access has been found.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26.\n“[E]ach passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable\ninfringement of the First Amendment” and “unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.” Jd. (internal citations omited). For the reasons above,\nDefendant’s motion should be unsealed immediately.\nJuror Questionnaires. Juror questionnaires have also regularly been found\nto be subject to the First Amendment right of access. See United States v.\nKing, l4o F.3d 76, 8o, 84 (2d Cir. l998); United States v. Simone, l4 F.3d\n833, 84o (2d Cir. l994); United States v. McDade, 929 F. Supp. 8l5, 8l7\nn.4 (E.D. Pa. l996); In re Newsday, Inc., l59 A.D.2d 667, 669 (N.Y. App.\nDiv. l99o). As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First Amendment’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First Amendment standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant. The question immediately before the Court—\nwhether a new trial should be granted to a high-profile defendant in light\nof statements made by a juror that Defendant alleges are evidence of juror\nmisconduct—is serious and goes to the heart of this Court’s Article I\njudicial pouer. The documents bear directly on not only “the manner in\nwhich criminal trials are conducted,” the aspect of government of highest\nconcern and importance, Richmond Newspaper, Inc. v.

Maxwell, No. l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write on behalf of Daily News, L.P., publisher of the New York Daily News, to\nrespectfully join in the requests of The Miami Herald, The New York Times, ABC News, and\nNBC News to unseal the motion for new trial and supporting exhibits filed by the Defendant in\nthis case, to unseal Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, and to unseal the juror questionnaires for the\nl2 seated jurors.!\n\nAs the Court is aware, the public and the press have a presumptive First Amendment and\ncommon law right of access to criminal proceedings and records. See Press Enterprise Co. v.\nSuperior Court of California, 464 U.S. 5ol, 5o8 (l984) (“Press Enterprise I’). The presumption\nof openness can only be overcome if “specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating\nthat closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that\ninterest.” Press—Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. l, l3-l4 (l986) (“Press-Enterprise\nIl’). Under this standard, the presumption in favor of access to court proceedings and records\nrequires \"the most compelling circumstances\" to justify any restriction upon that right. In re\nApplication of Nat'l B'casting Co., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o).\n\nThe reasons why the documents in question should be unsealed have been clearly set\nforth in the submissions by the other media entities. The Daily News would simply emphasize\nthat the right of access applies fully to <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> proceedings, including motions for a new trial\nand accompanying exhibits and memoranda. See, e.g., United States v. Donato, 7l4 F. App’x\n75, 76 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (concluding that documents atached to motion for a new\ntrial were judicial documents subject to right of access and holding that district court abused its\ndiscretion in refusing to unseal documents); United States v. Gonzalez, 927 F. Supp. 768, 784\n(D. Del. l996) (“the public, through its surrogate, the press, has a right of access to the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\nbriefs and appendix filed in support of defendant’s Motion for a New Trial’’); United States v.\n\n' Non-parties such as the Daily News have standing to intervene in criminal proceedings to assert\nthe public’s right of access. United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo884l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008842.jpg": "French, 2ol7 WL 27932, at *2 (D. Me. Jan. 3, 2ol7) (“the authority that would allou the Court\nto seal the memoranda submited [in support of a motion for a new trial] is extremely restricted\n... the Court concludes that the Defendants’ hypothetical strategic concerns must bend to the\npresumptive public right of access’’); cf. CBS, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for Cent. Dist. Of California,\n765 F.2d 823, 825 (9\" Cir. l985) (holding, in context of post-conviction motion to reduce\nsentence, that there is “no principled basis for affording greater confidentiality to <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\ndocuments and proceedings than is given to pretrial maters. The primary justifications for access\nto criminal proceedings . . . apply with as much force to post-conviction proceedings as to the\ntrial itself’).\n\nSignificantly, courts have held that this is true even where the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> proceedings in\nquestion relate to alleged juror misconduct. United States v. Simone, l4 F.3d 833, 84o (3d Cir.\nl994) (“We hold that the First Amendment right of access ataches to <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearings to\ninvestigate jury misconduct’); United States v.

For\nthe reasons set forth belou, the defense believes that Ms. Andriano’s last name should not be\nredacted in the publicly filed version of Court Exhibit 2.\n\nThe redactions to Court Exhibit 2 were the subject of some discussion among the parties.\nThe government originally proposed that Court Exhibit 2 should be filed under seal because the\nlist of names is alphabetized and redacting only anonymized names would provide identifying\ninformation for anonymized witnesses. The defense objected to that proposal on the grounds that\nit was unnecessary and overbroad to seal the entire document and that the names of anonymized\nwitnesses could be redacted.\n\nThe defense further objected to Ms. Andriano’s name being redacted in any way due to her\nrecent <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interview with the Daily Mail, in which she publicly disclosed her full name and\ndeclared her intention to waive her right to anonymity. According to the article, Ms. Andriano\nstated the follouing:\n\n2o86l75.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8849", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document59o _ Filed o2/ol/22 Page4of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nFebruary l, 2o22\nPage 4\nTo determine whether sealing a document is appropriate, the Court must engage in a multi-\nstep process. First, the Court must determine whether the document is a “judicial document” to\nwhich a presumption of access would atach. Silver, 2ol6 WL l572993, at *3 (citing Newsday\nLLC v. Cty. of Nassau, 73o F.3d l56, l66, l67 n.l5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)). If it is a “judicial document,”\nthe Court must next determine whether the common law right of access or the ““more robust”\nFirst Amendment right of access applies. /d. (citing Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o). Ifthe document is\nsubject to the common law right of access, the Court must “determine the weight of the\npresumption and measure it against competing considerations.” /d. (citing United States v. Erie\nCty. N.Y., 763 F.3d 235, 24l (2d Cir. 2ol4)); accord Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o. If the\ndocument is subject to the more stringent First Amendment right of access, the Court must\ndetermine “by specific, on the-record-findings whether higher values necessitate a narrouly\ntailored sealing.” Jd. (cleaned up); accord Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24. In either case, the Court\nmust also determine whether redaction is “a viable remedy,” or whether the document presents “an\nall or nothing mater.” /d. (quoting Amodeo IJ, 7l F.3d at lo53).\nDiscussion\nMs. Maxwell does not dispute that the Motion is a “judicial document” that is subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and the common law. See United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l7 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citing United States v. Gerena, 869\nF.2d 82, 85 (2d Cir. l989) (right of access under the First Amendment extends to briefs and\nmemoranda filed in connection with <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions in criminal cases)); id. at 5l8 (presumption\n2o873o6.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document59o _ Filed o2/ol/22 Page5of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nFebruary l, 2o22\nPage 5\nof access under the common law “‘is high for documents submited as part of dispositive-motion\npractice.” (citing Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l23)).\n\nBut there is no “higher value” or “competing consideration” that is more compelling or\nmore important than protecting Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair trial. See Silver, 2ol6\nWL l572993, at *5 (citing United States v. Doe, 63 F.3d l2l, l28 (2d Cir. l995) (“Compelling\ninterests may include the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”)). Sealing is warranted to protect a\ndefendant's fair trial rights if the Court makes specific findings that “first, there is a substantial\nprobability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that [sealing]\nwould prevent, and, second, reasonable alternatives to [sealing] cannot adequately protect the\ndefendant’s fair trial rights. /d. at *8 (quoting Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court of California for\nRiverside Cty., 478 U.S. l, l4 (l986) (citations omited) (“Press-Enterprise IT’)).\n\nAlthough cases addressing this point have focused on the need to seal to prevent the\nprejudicial effects of pretrial publicity on a defendant’s right to a fair trial, rather than the effects\nof <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> disclosure on a defendant’s motion for a new trial, the principle at stake is the same.\nMs. Maxwell vigorously asserts that she did not receive a fair trial because of Juror 5o’s presence\non the jury (and potentially the presence of other jurors who were the victims of sexual abuse).\nThrough her Motion, Ms. Maxwell is seeking to vindicate her right to a fair trial and to remedy the\nstructural error that occurred during the voir dire process. Ms. Maxwell’s fair trial rights must be\nprotected <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> just as vigorously as they are pre-trial.

The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing. The Defense\nMotion is not exceptional.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8896", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008903.jpg": "CaGade2N2o-o888GA2AEJN DdoourenbSso Filed o2/o8/22 PRggd@b!ll\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

If the\ndocument is subject to the more stringent First Amendment right of access, the Court must\ndetermine “by specific, on the-record-findings whether higher values necessitate a narrouly\ntailored sealing.” Jd.

Sealing is warranted to protect a\ndefendant's fair trial rights if the Court makes specific findings that “first, there is a substantial\nprobability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that [sealing]\nwould prevent, and, second, reasonable alternatives to [sealing] cannot adequately protect the\ndefendant’s fair trial rights. /d. at *8 (quoting Press-Enter.

For the reasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court, in the\nalternative, to:\n\nl. Vacate her convictions as to the Mann Act counts (Counts One through Four)\n\nand grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive amendment/variance from the allegations in the S2 Indictment\n(the “Indictment’”).\n\n2.

Enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 because the\ngovernment failed to prove each element of the crimes charged beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 23 of 37\nNew York law. Tr. 2o48:2o-2o49:l. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at llo (vacating conviction for\nconstructive amendment because the defense was not aware that the government would elicit\nevidence of marijuana distribution and may have modified its defense strategy had it knoun).\n\nInstead, the only option left to the defense after Jane’s testimony was to request a similar\ninstruction in the jury charge, which the Court denied. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:25. The Court further\ndenied the defense’s request for a clarifying instruction in response to the Jury Note, which made\nclear that the jury had likely done exactly what the limiting instruction would have prevented —\nnamely, concluded that Jane’s sexual abuse in New Mexico could constitute the “illegal sexual\nactivity” charged in the Indictment, even though it did not violate New York law. This resulted\nin the ultimate prejudice against Ms. Maxwell: a conviction on three of the four Mann Act\ncounts. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell was convicted on Counts One, Three, and Four based on a\nprejudicial variance from the charges in the Indictment. The Court must therefore vacate these\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n\nIl. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Only One of the Three Conspiracy Counts\n\nBecause They Are Multiplicitous.*\n\nSince the very first indictment in this case, the government’s conspiracy charges have\nbeen premised on a single criminal scheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to recruit and\n“groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity with Epstein. See Ind. 4 l-2.\nAlthough Counts One, Three, and Five of the S2 Indictment (the “Indictment”) charged Ms.\nMaxwell with three separate conspiracies under the general conspiracy statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nthe allegations in the indictment were based on a single conspiratorial agreement to sexually\nabuse minors, not three separate agreements to violate three different statutes. See Ind. 2 (“As\n3 We accept the jury’s verdict on the conspiracy counts solely for the purposes of this motion. Ms. Maxwell\nmaintains her position that the conspiracy counts should be vacated or dismissed for the reasons stated in her other\n<span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions set forth in this memorandum.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8947", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o4 _ Filed o2/l7/22 Page3of6\nhere, the misstatement concerned an issue so central that it is likely the juror, had he answered\naccurately, would have been disqualified for cause or disqualified through a peremptory\nchallenge. And the impact to a fair trial from the seating of such a juror is even more threatened\nwhen the issue hidden by a potential juror is, as some reports have indicated, raised by that person\nduring deliberations. Requiring proof of willfulness would make the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> inquiry too\nsubjective and thereby dilute the obligation to be accurate in the first place. Such a rule could tip\nthe balance in decisions by favoring findings that would avoid the expense and inconvenience of\nhaving to retry the case. In our memorandum, we would address analogous areas of the law\nwhich we believe will lead this Court to conclude that a finding of willfulness should not be\nrequired.\n\nte High-profile criminal cases, including ones that involve public outcry about\nunpopular defendants accused of heinous crimes, have been the stage for some of the most\nimportant decisions safeguarding the constitutional right to a fair trial. See, e.g., Sheppard v.\nMaxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363 (l966) (finding in a second-degree murder case for the alleged\nbludgeoning death of a pregnant wife that because extensive pre-trial publicity had emphasized\nevidence and opinions that tended to incriminate the defendant and that ongoing publicity during\nthe trial had revealed maters discussed outside the presence of the jury, the defendant was\nentitled to a new trial as a result of the “inherently prejudicial publicity which saturated the\ncommunity....”); /rvin v. Doud, 366 U.S. 7l7, 728 (l96l) (finding where there was continued\nadverse publicity fostering a strong prejudice against defendant who had allegedly confessed to\nsix murders in a small area, which caused two-thirds of the jury to admit before hearing any\ntestimony to possessing a belief in his guilt, that defendant must be retried). These are the cases\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8968", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008994.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6lo_ Filed o2/24/22 Page2of3\nAccordingly, for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order, a hearing is\nnecessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\n\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\nselection. Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\nselection—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing discovery.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s questionnaire be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy\nof his questionnaire and a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8994", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 33 of 66\nappeals’ statement that the good faith of a potential juror was “irrelevant” to the inquiry.\nId. at 553-56.\n\nThere were two concurring opinions in McDonough, joined by a total of five\njustices, which make clear that an intentionally false answer is not a prerequisite to\nobtaining a new trial. Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5-l6\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\nId. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring (emphasis added)). This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009043.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 42 of 66\na serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in [Juror No. 5o’s] shoes would be\nable to disregard [his] oun experiences in evaluating the evidence.” Jd. Moreover, like\nthe juror in Ashfar, Juror No. 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> conduct further supports a finding of implied\nbias. The juror in Ashfar communicated with a victim of sexual assault; here, Juror No.\n5o communicated with Annie Famer. The juror in Ashfar viewed himself as “advocate for\npeople;” here, Juror No. 5o proclaimed that the verdict against Ms. Maxwell was a\nverdict “for all the victims.”\n\nThe bias of Juror No. 5o should be implied for another reason: “[R]epeated lies in\nvoir dire imply that the juror concealed material facts in order to secure a spot on the\nparticular jury.” Daugerdas, 867 F.

Juror No. 5o’s publicity tour appears to have stopped\n(at least temporarily) only because the government publicly filed a leter asking this\nCourt to inquire into Juror No. 5o’s truthfulness and suggesting that he needed a lawyer.\nThe clear message from the government to Juror No. 5o was to stop talking. >\n\n'* Tt is common for the British press to pay for crime victims’ stories. See, e.g,\nhtps://www.mirror.co.uk/sell-my-story/; htps://trianglenews.co.uk/sell-my-story-to-the-\ndaily-mail/; htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/contactus/index.html\n\n'S Juror No. 5o was clearly enjoying his fifteen minutes of fame in early January\n2o22, giving multiple interviews in which he congratulated himself as the person who\npersuaded the other jurors to adopt his biased view of the evidence and to vote to convict\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nThe government recognized that Juror No. 5o had dug a very deep hole—a hole\nthat looked to be geting deeper. Without conferring as to either the submission of the\nleter or any redactions, the government publicly filed Docket No. 568. This leter\ncommunicated to Juror No. 5o, and the media, that Juror No. 5o had done something\nwrong, that his conduct would be subject to scrutiny, and that the conduct was serious\nenough to warrant appointment of a lawyer, free of charge if necessary.\n\nHad Ms. Maxwell been asked, she would have objected to the public filing of this\nleter, which caused Juror No. 5o to delete his social media accounts and alerted Juror\nNo. 5o that he needed to stop giving media presentations and to work on his story.\n\nThe government knous hou to file a leter under seal, and this Court’s protocol\nthroughout this case has been for the parties to file leters or pleadings under restriction\nwith a conferral and briefing as to what portion of the document should be redacted.

The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4l of 49\naffirmed, holding that “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made\nto a magazine reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence’ requiring any juror inquiry beyond that already made.” Guzman Loera, 2o22 WL\n2ll99, at *l2 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). The same is true here: a newspaper report about\nan anonymous juror who had experienced sexual abuse is not “incontrovertible evidence” that\njuror misconduct occurred.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Bin Laden, one defendant sought a new trial based on a\nsentence in a newspaper article, which, based on interviews with jurors, stated that “[o]ne juror\nused the internet at home to research a difficult legal concept concerning [one] defendant.” The\ndistrict court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, holding that “[t]his single sentence, an\nunsworn snippet of hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn\naffidavits present in cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.” United States v. Bin\nLaden, No. S7R 98 Cr. lo23 (KTD), 2oo5 WL 2874o4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2oo5), aff'd sub\nnom. In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Afr., 552 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\nFinally, in Martha Stewart, the defendant brought a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motion alleging a host of\ndeliberate omissions by a juror. 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 438. Among the alleged deliberate omissions\nwas that the juror had been fired from his job at Citibank for abusing drugs or improper expense\naccounting. Jd. at 442. The district court denied a hearing with regard to this (and the other)\nallegations, as it was based on (a) statements of an individual who “appears to be reporting\nrumors,” and (b) an anonymous call to the defendant’s lawyer from an individual purporting to\nwork for Citibank. /d. The Second Circuit affirmed that decision, noting that the defendant’s\nfactual proffer as to this (and certain other) allegations was “insufficient.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at\n3o5 & n.7. And although the Second Circuit stated in dicta that it might have held a hearing in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to harassment” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial. And\nRequest l(d) calls for communications about any payment Juror 5o received for media interviews,\nbut even if he received compensation for <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews that says nothing whatsoever about\nwhether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial based on his alleged experience\nwith sexual abuse.\n\nRequests 2(a) and 2(b) ask the Court to direct numerous social media companies to produce\nall communications to and from Juror 5o about his jury service and all posts or comments regarding\n4]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l62", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l3 of 32\n\nThe government’s invocation of Tanner and Janniello is strikingly disingenuous. Both\ncases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in\n“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at ll9, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866\nF.2d at 543.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, xa\nRes conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance\nof courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into hou the jury reached its decision\nsimply has no relevance here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.\n\nIn fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second\nCircuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations\nby ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\njury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to harassment and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the questionnaire, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9548", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page 8of2l\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nDkt. No. 462 at 24. In response to that question, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” not the box\nfor either “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But in several public statements\nmade to media outlets after the trial, including interviews in The Independent and The Daily Mail\ndated January 5, 2o22, Juror 5o stated that he was sexually abused as a minor. The statements\nare direct, unambiguous, and made by Juror 5o himself to multiple media outlets. Moreover, the\nstatements themselves describe Juror 5o’s oun experience.* They constitute “clear, strong,\nsubstantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety has\noccurred,” and so warrant an evidentiary hearing. Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n\nAlthough the Court does not decide whether the threshold to hold a hearing based on\nQuestion 25 alone has been met, because the Court will hold a hearing on Juror 5o’s answer to\nQuestion 48 and because Question 48 and 25 are sufficiently related, the Court will inquire into\nJuror 5o’s answer to Question 25. Question 25 asked jurors:\n\nHave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of a crime?\n\nDkt. No. 462 at l3. Again, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” and not the box for either “Yes\n(self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements, if true, may\ndescribe criminal conduct of which he was the victim. Therefore, Juror 5o’s answer to Question\n25 is sufficiently related to the answer to Question 48 and so the Court will also inquire as to\nQuestion 25 at an evidentiary hearing. See Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n* The articles additionally state that Juror 5o shared this experience with the jury during deliberations. The Court is\nprohibited by Rule 6o6 from considering that Juror 5o also told this information to the jury. That Juror 5o revealed\nthat he also disclosed this information to the jury does not prohibit the Court from considering Juror 5o’s\nindependent statements made to a reporter about his oun experience.\n\n8\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9549", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o.

The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagellof2l\n\nFirst, the news article upon which the Defendant relies does not warrant a hearing.\nBaker, 899 F.3d at l3o. The article includes a short, non-detailed mention of an anonymous\njuror. As the Second Circuit recently held in affirming the denial of a hearing after a high-profile\ntrial, “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made to a magazine\nreporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence’” of\nmisconduct that requires a hearing. United States v. Guzman Loera, 24 F 4th l44, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o22) (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). Another court in this circuit held that a New York\nTimes article that, in a single sentence, alleged misconduct by an unidentified juror was\ninsufficient to justify a hearing. United States v.

But using a\ncommon tool among sexual offenders does not render the distinct conspiracies here multiplicitous;\nif that were true, presumably many federal crimes against children would be multiplicitous.\n\nThe Government was clear at trial that, while the defendant and Epstein commited crimes\ntogether for years, they did so through different schemes, in violation of different laws.

Questions to Determine the Nature of Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and Whether Juror\n5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury Questionnaire Were False\nUnder the McDonough test, the Court must first determine whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were, in fact, false as reflected in his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements to the media.\nUnited States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough Pouer Equipment,\nInc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)). It is also necessary for the Court to inquire about\nthe nature of the sexual abuse that Juror 5o experienced. Had Juror 5o disclosed in response to\nQuestion 48 that he was the victim of sexual abuse, he would have had to explain the nature of\nthat abuse in his response to the very next question. See Question 48a. Furthermore, it is\nimportant for the Court to explore the specifics of Juror 5o’s sexual abuse to determine hou\nsimilar his experience was to the experiences of the witnesses who testified at trial. See United\nStates v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (“Courts imply bias ‘when there\nare similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’”\n(quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l63-64 (D. Mass. 2oll)). Accordingly,\nthe defense requests that the Court ask Juror 5o the follouing questions:\nl. The Independent and the Daily Mail reported that you said you were the victim of\nsexual abuse when you were child, correct?\n2. Did you say that?\n3. So, itis accurate that you claim to have been a victim of sexual abuse when you were\nunder the age of consent?\n4. Hou old were you when you were sexually abused?\n2loo689.3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9639", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 33 of 66\nappeals’ statement that the good faith of a potential juror was “irrelevant” to the inquiry.\nId. at 553-56.\n\nThere were two concurring opinions in McDonough, joined by a total of five\njustices, which make clear that an intentionally false answer is not a prerequisite to\nobtaining a new trial. Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5-l6\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\nId. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring (emphasis added)). This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 42 of 66\na serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in [Juror No. 5o’s] shoes would be\nable to disregard [his] oun experiences in evaluating the evidence.” Jd. Moreover, like\nthe juror in Ashfar, Juror No. 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> conduct further supports a finding of implied\nbias. The juror in Ashfar communicated with a victim of sexual assault; here, Juror No.\n5o communicated with Annie Famer. The juror in Ashfar viewed himself as “advocate for\npeople;” here, Juror No. 5o proclaimed that the verdict against Ms. Maxwell was a\nverdict “for all the victims.”\n\nThe bias of Juror No. 5o should be implied for another reason: “[R]epeated lies in\nvoir dire imply that the juror concealed material facts in order to secure a spot on the\nparticular jury.” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472. Here, not only did Juror No. 5o\nfalsely deny on the questionnaire that he had been a victim of a crime and a victim of\nsexual assault and sexual abuse, he also falsely answered the Court’s questions about\nsocial media. According to Juror No. 5o, he used only Facebook and Instagram and he\ndeleted all his social media accounts. In fact, Juror No. 5o was a Twiter user, having\njoined Twiter in April 2o2l. His Twiter account appears to have been active during trial\nand voir dire, notwithstanding his claim that he deleted all his social media accounts.\nMoreover, after trial, Juror No. 5o used Twiter to publicize his interviews with the press\nand to communicate directly to Annie Farmer. It also appears Juror No. 5o did not delete\nhis Instagram account.\n\nCrucially, “[e]ven when prospective jurors are dishonest for reasons other than a\ndesire to secure a seat on the jury, dishonest answers to voir dire questions indicate that a\njuror ls unwilling or unable ‘to apply the law as instructed by the court to the evidence\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9734", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 49 of 66\nseveral different news outlets (some of which he was likely paid for) '*, and he sat for an\ninterview as part of an hour-long “documentary” called “Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and\nthe Paedophile,” which aired on the British channel ITV.

Juror No. 5o’s publicity tour appears to have stopped\n(at least temporarily) only because the government publicly filed a leter asking this\nCourt to inquire into Juror No. 5o’s truthfulness and suggesting that he needed a lawyer.\nThe clear message from the government to Juror No. 5o was to stop talking. >\n\n'* Tt is common for the British press to pay for crime victims’ stories. See, e.g,\nhtps://www.mirror.co.uk/sell-my-story/; htps://trianglenews.co.uk/sell-my-story-to-the-\ndaily-mail/; htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/contactus/index.html\n\n'S Juror No. 5o was clearly enjoying his fifteen minutes of fame in early January\n2o22, giving multiple interviews in which he congratulated himself as the person who\npersuaded the other jurors to adopt his biased view of the evidence and to vote to convict\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nThe government recognized that Juror No. 5o had dug a very deep hole—a hole\nthat looked to be geting deeper. Without conferring as to either the submission of the\nleter or any redactions, the government publicly filed Docket No. 568. This leter\ncommunicated to Juror No. 5o, and the media, that Juror No. 5o had done something\nwrong, that his conduct would be subject to scrutiny, and that the conduct was serious\nenough to warrant appointment of a lawyer, free of charge if necessary.\n\nHad Ms. Maxwell been asked, she would have objected to the public filing of this\nleter, which caused Juror No. 5o to delete his social media accounts and alerted Juror\nNo. 5o that he needed to stop giving media presentations and to work on his story.\n\nThe government knous hou to file a leter under seal, and this Court’s protocol\nthroughout this case has been for the parties to file leters or pleadings under restriction\nwith a conferral and briefing as to what portion of the document should be redacted.

Juror 5o has not publicly disclosed the particulars of any sexual abuse that he\nsuffered, and thus it is not apparent whether it was in fact a crime. Nor is it apparent that, if the\nabuse was criminal, Juror 5o deliberately lied when he answered Question 25 in the negative, as\nlay persons often may not think of themselves as victims of a crime even where lawyers and judges\nwould. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did\nnot disclose past sexual abuse in response to question about whether she had been a victim of a\ncrime because she did not consider the abuse, for which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime);\nsee also McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nFinally, the available information does not support the defendant’s claim that Juror 5o lied\nduring voir dire when he (l) stated that he used Facebook and Instagram, without mentioning that\nhe had a Twiter account, and (2) stated that he had deleted his social media accounts prior to trial.\n(See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33). First, the screenshot of Juror 5o’s Twiter account provided by the\ndefense states that he joined Twiter in April 2o2l, had only one follouer, and only folloued 39\npeople. (Def. Mem. at l8). That hardly bespeaks an active Twiter user, so it was not even\ninaccurate, much less deliberately false, for Juror 5o not to mention Twiter when asked “What did\nyou use, Facebook, Twiter?” (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33 (emphasis added)). Second, in support\nof the argument that Juror 5o lied about deleting his Facebook and Instagram accounts, the\ndefendant cites only <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> activity on his Instagram account, but as the defendant must\nacknouledge (Def.

The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4l of 49\naffirmed, holding that “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made\nto a magazine reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence’ requiring any juror inquiry beyond that already made.” Guzman Loera, 2o22 WL\n2ll99, at *l2 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). The same is true here: a newspaper report about\nan anonymous juror who had experienced sexual abuse is not “incontrovertible evidence” that\njuror misconduct occurred.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Bin Laden, one defendant sought a new trial based on a\nsentence in a newspaper article, which, based on interviews with jurors, stated that “[o]ne juror\nused the internet at home to research a difficult legal concept concerning [one] defendant.” The\ndistrict court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, holding that “[t]his single sentence, an\nunsworn snippet of hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn\naffidavits present in cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.” United States v. Bin\nLaden, No. S7R 98 Cr. lo23 (KTD), 2oo5 WL 2874o4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2oo5), aff'd sub\nnom. In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Afr., 552 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\nFinally, in Martha Stewart, the defendant brought a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motion alleging a host of\ndeliberate omissions by a juror. 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 438. Among the alleged deliberate omissions\nwas that the juror had been fired from his job at Citibank for abusing drugs or improper expense\naccounting. Jd. at 442. The district court denied a hearing with regard to this (and the other)\nallegations, as it was based on (a) statements of an individual who “appears to be reporting\nrumors,” and (b) an anonymous call to the defendant’s lawyer from an individual purporting to\nwork for Citibank. /d. The Second Circuit affirmed that decision, noting that the defendant’s\nfactual proffer as to this (and certain other) allegations was “insufficient.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at\n3o5 & n.7. And although the Second Circuit stated in dicta that it might have held a hearing in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9839", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to harassment” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial. And\nRequest l(d) calls for communications about any payment Juror 5o received for media interviews,\nbut even if he received compensation for <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews that says nothing whatsoever about\nwhether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial based on his alleged experience\nwith sexual abuse.\n\nRequests 2(a) and 2(b) ask the Court to direct numerous social media companies to produce\nall communications to and from Juror 5o about his jury service and all posts or comments regarding\n4]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 32\n\nThe government’s invocation of Tanner and Janniello is strikingly disingenuous. Both\ncases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in\n“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at ll9, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866\nF.2d at 543.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, there is at least one juror who falsely answered voir dire\nquestions to gain a seat on the jury, conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance\nof courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into hou the jury reached its decision\nsimply has no relevance here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.\n\nIn fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second\nCircuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations\nby ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\njury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to harassment and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable\nbias, or actual bias. See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). In determining\nwhether Juror 5o was biased, the Court should consider several factors, including “[l] the\n\nsimilarity between the juror’s experiences and important facts presented at trial, [2] the scope\nand severity of the juror’s dishonesty, and [3] the juror’s motive for lying.” See Sampson v.\nUnited States, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l\" Cir. 2ol3) (citations omited). The record developed at the\nHearing strengthened the already compelling evidence of Juror 5o’s bias and established that,\nhad he answered the questionnaire honestly, he would have been struck for cause.\n\nA. The Similarity Between Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and the Witnesses’ Sexual\n\nAbuse, As Well As His <span class=\"highlight\">Post-Trial</span> Conduct, Establish Bias.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which significantly\nparalleled the abuse described by the government’s four key victim witnesses at trial. Jury 5o\nhad already disclosed some of these facts in his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> press interviews. But the opportunity\nto question Juror 5o further about the circumstances of his abuse at the Hearing—an opportunity\nthat Ms. Maxwell was denied at voir dire because of his false answers to the questionnaire—\nrevealed even more striking similarities to the abuse described by the four victim witnesses at\ntrial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor, (il) was abused on\nmultiple occasions over the course of several years, and (i) delayed reporting the abuse. (Tr. 8-\n9). Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused by two people who were friends and who each\nparticipated in the abuse. (Tr. 8-9). Furthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or\nsexually assaulted by someone he did not knou. He was abused by someone familiar to him, his\nstepbrother, who was part of his life (Tr. 8-9), just as the four accusers described the relationship\nbetween their families and Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. These similarities are significant and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page6ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

It caused him\nto regard himself as an advocate of the victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. Even if\nthe Court credits Juror 5o’s contention (and it should not) that he did not have these emotions at\nthe time of voir dire and only developed them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shous\nthat Juror 5o was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the evidence in the\ncase.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67; see also Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who\ndid not disclose his prior sexual abuse, communicated with a female victim of sexual assault, and\nidentified himself as “an advocate for the people”).\n\nMoreover, the hearing testimony established that Juror 5o’s history of sexual abuse did,\nin fact, compromise his ability to be fair and impartial. Prior to the Hearing, Juror 5o told the\npress that he recalled several details of his oun sexual abuse and that “some of it can be replayed\nlike a video.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o underscored that his oun experience of sexual abuse\nshaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work. He stated that he\ntalked to the press about “hou I view things and hou I can recall memories ... [and] remember\nthings and recall things, like the color of the wall[.]” (Tr. 23). He further stated that his oun\nmemories are “why I believe a certain way” about the nature of victims’ memories. (Tr. 22). As\nset forth in our initial Motion, Juror 5o’s beliefs directly contradict Dr. Loftus’ expert testimony\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document65o _ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagelof2\n: U.S. Department of Justice\nSs United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\n<span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo324", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2 of 4o\nquestioned the juror under oath and under the penalty of perjury. The Court inquired about\nwhether his answers were false, his explanation for giving those answers, and hou he would\nhave responded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided at the time of jury\nselection. This inquiry was limited by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which prohibits a juror\nfrom testifying about the content of deliberations or his mental processes in evaluating the\nevidence at trial. The rule embodies long-accepted federal law and is an important safeguard of\nthe integrity of the jury trial system. The hearing was further limited by Supreme Court and\nSecond Circuit law that permits inquiry only if there is clear and incontrovertible evidence of\npotential misconduct by the juror.\n\nBased on the hearing record, the questions before the Court are whether Juror 5o failed to\nanswer honestly a material question during jury selection, and whether, if he had provided a\ncorrect response, the Court would have struck him “for cause” because he was biased.\nControlling law is clear that the question is not whether the Defendant would have chosen to\nexercise one of her discretionary peremptory strikes against this juror had he accurately disclosed\nhis prior sexual abuse. It is only whether the Court would have struck him for cause due to\nactual, implied, or inferred bias. See McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc., 464 U.S. at 555-56. The\nlimits on the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> inquiry serve the important interest in the finality of\njudgments.\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to satisfy the demanding requirements\nof the controlling Supreme Court decision, McDonough v. Greenwood. The Court finds Juror 5o\ntestified credibly at the hearing. There are many reasons for that finding. He appeared to testify\nfrankly and honestly, even when the answers he gave were the cause of personal embarrassment\nand regret. His incentive at the hearing was to testify truthfully or face criminal perjury charges.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”’).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Jd. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 25 of 4o\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides, and he had no reason to think otherwise.\nVoir Dire Tr. at l28, l3o, l34.\n\nThe Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s arguments to the contrary. The Defendant\nargues that Juror 5o was actually biased because his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements reveal that at the time\nof voir dire he regarded himself as a non-neutral advocate for the victims. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 6.4 In particular, she relies on Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews, in which he\n“proclaim[ed]” that the guilty verdict was for “for all the victims.” /d. But these <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\nstatements do not establish that Juror 5o was actually biased against the Defendant. The\nevidence at trial established that there was more than one victim of the Defendant’s crimes,\nmaking Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statement reasonable. And, more importantly, Juror 5o’s view of the\nDefendant after the thirteen-day trial, during which he heard evidence that swayed him and\neleven other jurors to convict the Defendant on five counts, does not shed light on any bias he\nallegedly harbored “before he heard the evidence presented.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-\n4o & n.4 (emphasis in original) (rejecting argument that juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements that the\nverdict was “a victory for the litle guy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant\n“thought she was above everything” revealed bias).\n\n2. Implied and Inferred Bias\n\nThe Defendant’s central argument is that the Court should imply—based on Juror 5o’s\npersonal history of sexual abuse, <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> actions, and hearing testimony—that Juror 5o was\nbiased against the Defendant. She similarly argues that the Court should infer Juror 5o’s bias\n* Tn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant reserved arguing that Juror 5o was actually biased in the event the Court\nheld an evidentiary hearing. Maxwell Br. at 39. The Defendant does not expressly argue that Juror 5o was actually\nbiased in her post-hearing briefing, but the Court understands this argument to raise an actual bias issue. See\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 2-3.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n5 It is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased. Maxwell\nBr. at 3l-32; Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. Id.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo357", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at S—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror SO is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “‘believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt. All jurors have no doubt experienced the recall of\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo358", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\ntk KR ok\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing. His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo362", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 4o of 4o\nselection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate. The Court further concludes that\nJuror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\nThe requirements for a new trial under McDonough are not satisfied.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page8of77\nconfinement, isolated from all other inmates, and subjected to abnormally rigorous conditions. On\nApril 2o, 2o22, almost four months after trial, she was abruptly placed in general population, and\nthe charade of her pretrial detention was revealed: Her unusual detention was intended to help\nredeem DOJ and BOP reputations tarnished by Epstein’s untimely death in custody and to ensure\nthat Epstein’s accusers would have their day in court. Ms. Maxwell’s pre-sentence detention was\ntantamount to pre-sentence punishment.\n\nNor will Ms. Maxwell’s disproportionate pre-sentence punishment end nou that she is in\ngeneral population. Just recently, Ms. Maxwell was the target of a credible death threat from a\nfellou inmate. On information and belief, one of the female inmates in Ms. Maxwell’s housing\nunit told at least three other inmates that she had been offered money to murder Ms. Maxwell and\nthat she planned to strangle her in her sleep. The inmate who made the threat has been moved to\nthe SHU, presumably to protect Ms. Maxwell.’ This incident reflects the brutal reality that there\nare numerous prison inmates who would not hesitate to kill Ms. Maxwell — whether for money,\nfame, or simple “street cred.” Ms. Maxwell has effectively traded the stress of flashlight checks\nevery l5 minutes in the middle of the night while in isolation for the equivalent stress of having\nto sleep with one eye open - for as long as she is housed with other inmates. Ms. Maxwell will\nhave live with this threat every day that she is housed in the MDC and every day that she is\nincarcerated in the prison where she is designated.\n\nThe Offense Conduct\n\nHaving ruled on extensive pre- and <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions and having presided over the jury\ntrial and the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing regarding Juror 5o, the Court is fully familiar with the record in\n7 See PSR l8.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo454", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page9of77\nthis case.8\nThe Presentence Investigation Report\nOn June 9, 2o22, Probation filed its final PSR recommending a belou-guidelines sentence\nof 24o months’ imprisonment, folloued by a five-year term of supervised release. See PSR at 65.\nRegarding a sentencing recommendation, Probation has identified several\nmitigating factors. Maxwell is 6l years old, and a guidelines sentence may be\ntantamount to a lifetime term of imprisonment. The defendant has a reported history\nof philanthropy, charitable work, and helping others namely her work with the\nClinton Global Initiative, The TerraMar Project, her use of EMT skills to help\nothers, and her tutoring of inmates at the MDC. We further acknouledge that\nMaxwell is not solely responsible for the horrendous and irreparable damage caused\nby the decade.\nPSR at 66-67.\nAdjustment to Incarceration\nDespite her extraordinarily restrictive conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell has availed\nherself of any programming or work opportunity available to her. While in solitary confinement,\nshe completed six courses, but until transferred to general population, she never had the\nopportunity to make use of that training. <span class=\"highlight\">Post-trial</span> she was permited to work as an orderly which\nhas continued in general population. Since placed in general population, she has eagerly provided\na wide variety of assistance to the women is her unit, including GED tutoring. See PSR. §l6. In\naddition, she has participated in and completed several educational courses. See PSR §l5.\n* Ms. Maxwell is planning to appeal her conviction follouing sentencing.

As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First Amendment’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First Amendment standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant.

Maxwell purported to\nbefriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult\nsupervision, while isolating them from others.

Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages.

But a panel of this Court considering\nan appeal in the criminal case presided over by Judge Nathan won’t have any\njurisdiction to review orders entered by Judge Preska in the civil case. The time for\nreviewing Judge Preska’s unsealing order in the civil case is right nou in the appeal\nof Judge Preska’s order, Giuffre v.

Juror 5o's <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020472.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page86 of 9l\n\nUSA.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter.

After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered.

Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance.

If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l.

See Dkt. Nos. 6o5, 6o6. The Court\nhas reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with\nits prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 6o5. The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 5ol,\n5ll-l2 (l984)). Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs,\naccompanying exhibits, and their January l3 leters, by February 25, 2o22. The Court\nwill docket Juror 5o's motion. As noted in its prior Order, follouing the Court's\nresolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly\nunsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020573.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page87 of 92\n\nUSA.

Case returned to Judge Nathan. (bw) (Entered: o4/ol/2o22)\n\no4/ol/2o22 | 653 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o.

The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o573", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020577.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page9l of 92\n\no6/26/2o22 | 68l | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 596, and justifying any such request by\nreference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid.\nCo. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing. His failure to disclose his prior\nsexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.\nThe Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and\ncould serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation\nreport. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy\nTrial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2o22. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on\nthese counts because the pending <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions affect the scheduling considerations\nset forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22 leter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant\nconsents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The Court will rule on the Defendant's\nremaining post-verdict motions in due course. Sentencing remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3, 6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

As a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> house-keeping mater, the Court has\ndetermined that a few miscellaneous court orders failed to be docketed during trial: -\nNovember l9, 2o2l Memorandum Opinion & Order re Witness-3 (Kate); - November 22,\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l lo2/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o724", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020866.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page4o of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 6lo Filed o2/24/22 Page 2of3\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order, a hearing is\nnecessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\nselection. Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\nselection—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing discovery.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s questionnaire be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy\nof his questionnaire and a copy of this Order.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\n<span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020945.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagell9 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2 of 4o\n\nquestioned the juror under oath and under the penalty of perjury. The Court inquired about\nwhether his answers were false, his explanation for giving those answers, and hou he would\nhave responded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided at the time of jury\nselection. This inquiry was limited by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which prohibits a juror\nfrom testifying about the content of deliberations or his mental processes in evaluating the\nevidence at trial. The rule embodies long-accepted federal law and is an important safeguard of\nthe integrity of the jury trial system. The hearing was further limited by Supreme Court and\nSecond Circuit law that permits inquiry only if there is clear and incontrovertible evidence of\npotential misconduct by the juror.\n\nBased on the hearing record, the questions before the Court are whether Juror 5o failed to\nanswer honestly a material question during jury selection, and whether, if he had provided a\ncorrect response, the Court would have struck him “for cause” because he was biased.\nControlling law is clear that the question is not whether the Defendant would have chosen to\nexercise one of her discretionary peremptory strikes against this juror had he accurately disclosed\nhis prior sexual abuse. It is only whether the Court would have struck him for cause due to\nactual, implied, or inferred bias. See McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc., 464 U.S. at 555-56. The\nlimits on the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> inquiry serve the important interest in the finality of\njudgments.\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to satisfy the demanding requirements\nof the controlling Supreme Court decision, McDonough v. Greenwood. The Court finds Juror 5o\ntestified credibly at the hearing. There are many reasons for that finding. He appeared to testify\nfrankly and honestly, even when the answers he gave were the cause of personal embarrassment\nand regret. His incentive at the hearing was to testify truthfully or face criminal perjury charges.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o945", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020964.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel38 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf. United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?””).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” /d. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o964", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020965.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel39 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\n\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (‘Tm also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o965", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020968.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel42 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 25 of 4o\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides, and he had no reason to think otherwise.\nVoir Dire Tr. at l28, l3o, l34.\n\nThe Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s arguments to the contrary. The Defendant\nargues that Juror 5o was actually biased because his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements reveal that at the time\nof voir dire he regarded himself as a non-neutral advocate for the victims. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 6.* In particular, she relies on Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews, in which he\n“proclaim[ed]” that the guilty verdict was for “for all the victims.” /d. But these <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\nstatements do not establish that Juror 5o was actually biased against the Defendant. The\nevidence at trial established that there was more than one victim of the Defendant’s crimes,\nmaking Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statement reasonable. And, more importantly, Juror 5o’s view of the\nDefendant after the thirteen-day trial, during which he heard evidence that swayed him and\neleven other jurors to convict the Defendant on five counts, does not shed light on any bias he\nallegedly harbored “before he heard the evidence presented.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-\n4o & n.4 (emphasis in original) (rejecting argument that juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements that the\nverdict was “a victory for the litle guy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant\n“thought she was above everything” revealed bias).\n\n2. Implied and Inferred Bias\n\nThe Defendant’s central argument is that the Court should imply—based on Juror 5o’s\npersonal history of sexual abuse, <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> actions, and hearing testimony—that Juror 5o was\nbiased against the Defendant. She similarly argues that the Court should infer Juror 5o’s bias\n4 In her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant reserved arguing that Juror 5o was actually biased in the event the Court\nheld an evidentiary hearing. Maxwell Br. at 39. The Defendant does not expressly argue that Juror 5o was actually\nbiased in her post-hearing briefing, but the Court understands this argument to raise an actual bias issue. See\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 2-3.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o968", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020969.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel43 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n> Tt is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span>\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o969", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020974.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel48 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\n\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020978.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel52 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garmered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror 5o is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt. All jurors have no doubt experienced the recall of\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o978", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020982.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel56 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\neK\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> hearing. His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o982", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020983.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5/7 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 4o of 4o\nselection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate. The Court further concludes that\nJuror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\nThe requirements for a new trial under McDonough are not satisfied.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction.

FRE 6o6 Did Not Prevent Inquiry into Juror 5o’s Use of Prior Abuse in\n\nPersuading Jury to Convict Maxwell\n\nThe court erred in applying Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6 to preclude any\ntestimony from Juror 5o about his statements to journalists.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b) precludes a juror from testifying about deliberations\nand jurors’ mental processes in the course thereof but allous testimony regarding\nextraneous prejudicial information, i.e., when certain outside influences on the jury\nare involved. Rule 6o6(b) expressly authorizes jurors to testify as to “extraneous\nprejudicial information” or “outside influences.” The rationale behind 6o6(b) is the\nneed to prevent <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> scrutiny, the harassment of former jurors by losing\nparties, and to promote juror privacy. See, Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7\n(l987).\n\nIn this case, houever, we are not faced with a conflict between policy\nconsiderations underlying Rule 6o6(b). Indeed, such public policy concerns are\ninapplicable in this case, where the juror, on his oun, broadcast his experiences\nand the role he played in jury deliberations. Inquiry into these statements does not\nrisk exposing a juror to harassment or intimidation. In fact, the only reason the\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll32", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021527.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o39, Page97 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 3 of 2l\n\npress outlets about his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the mater.

For completeness of the record, the Court notes the follouing occurred also on January 5, 2o22: The Jury\nDepartment of the Southern District of New York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of\nstatements he had given to certain media outlets that were being widely reported on in the press and inquiring\nwhether he needed an atorney. At the Court’s direction, the District Executive returned Juror 5o’s call and\ninformed him that the Court was unable to provide any guidance or response to his question. Juror 5o then asked the\nDistrict Executive if he could access his questionnaire. The District Executive, again at the Court’s direction,\ninformed Juror 5o that the questionnaire was not a public document and could not be provided to him.\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l527", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021531.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagelol of 2l7\nSA-355\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 7 of 2l\n\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8.

The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees.

No. 462 at 24. In response to that question, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” not the box\nfor either “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But in several public statements\nmade to media outlets after the trial, including interviews in The Independent and The Daily Mail\ndated January 5, 2o22, Juror 5o stated that he was sexually abused as a minor. The statements\nare direct, unambiguous, and made by Juror 5o himself to multiple media outlets. Moreover, the\nstatements themselves describe Juror 5o’s oun experience.* They constitute “clear, strong,\nsubstantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety has\noccurred,” and so warrant an evidentiary hearing. Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n\nAlthough the Court does not decide whether the threshold to hold a hearing based on\nQuestion 25 alone has been met, because the Court will hold a hearing on Juror 5o’s answer to\nQuestion 48 and because Question 48 and 25 are sufficiently related, the Court will inquire into\nJuror 5o’s answer to Question 25. Question 25 asked jurors:\n\nHave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of a crime?\n\nDkt. No. 462 at l3. Again, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” and not the box for either “Yes\n(self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements, if true, may\ndescribe criminal conduct of which he was the victim. Therefore, Juror 5o’s answer to Question\n25 is sufficiently related to the answer to Question 48 and so the Court will also inquire as to\nQuestion 25 at an evidentiary hearing. See Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n4 The articles additionally state that Juror 5o shared this experience with the jury during deliberations.

The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49-\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">post-trial</span> statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment.

United States, 576 F.2d 432, 438 (2d Cir. l978) (affirming the denial of a\nhearing where the defendant presented “weakly authenticated, vague, and speculative material as\nto one juror,” even where that juror was not anonymous); United States v.

Nieves turned\non the court’s failure to explore juror bias related to gangs — a prejudice analogous\nto the systematic or pervasive bias in the community against accused sex traffickers\nand those who consort with them. Maxwell, tied to Epstein by media coverage, went\nto trial against a constant drumbeat of news and allegations concerning child\nmolesters and sex trafficking. Far more pervasive than fear of gang violence was\nfear and revulsion as to child sex abuse and trafficking of which Epstein, and then\nMaxwell became the poster child. In the hearing, and despite defense suggested\nquestions, the Court refused to explore Juror 5o’s child sexual abuse for bias.\n\nTo assess a challenge for cause as to this seated juror after trial the court\nshould use the same standards for cause challenges at trial. To do otherwise would\nappear to shield the verdict rather than the defendant from improper juror bias. As\nin Nieves, the juror’s omited information related to a “material issue” that was at\ntrial “the cornerstone of the government’s theory.” There was a strong likelihood\nthat the material issue would skew deliberations considering the strong feelings that\nsex trafficking of minors engenders.
