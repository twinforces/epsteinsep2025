Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 74 of 8o\nfairness required enforcement of the prosecution’s plea offer that was later withdrawn,\nwhere the defendant detrimentally relied upon the offer); Commonwealth v.

As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement.
