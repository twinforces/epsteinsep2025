Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.\nEpstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his\npretrial detention.\nV. Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity. Even if the Court should have concerns to the contrary, there clearly exist a\ncombination of conditions that would be sufficient to assure his presence as required and/or the\nsafety of the community, including but not limited to some or all of the conditions proposed\nsupra, or any other conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate.\nYours truly,\nReid Weingarten\nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC)\nll4 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY loo36\n(2o2)-5o6-39oo\nFax: (2l2)-5o6-395o\nrweingarten@steptoe.com\nMartin G.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ...

In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o.

The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable.

The District Atorney encourages the parties to resolve their dispute\n\nfrom this point forward with a minimum of rhetoric.\nId. (emphasis added).\nzs There is no doubt that there are two decisions at issue: the decision not to\nprosecute and the decision not to discuss that choice in public. The dissent would\nendorse the trial court’s selective interpretation of D.A. Castor’s language in the press\nrelease, finding at a minimum that D.A. Castor’s assertion that he would reconsider the\n“decision” is ambiguous. But a plain reading of the release belies such a construction.\nLike the trial court’s interpretation of the relevant paragraph of the press release, the\ndissent’s finding of ambiguity can result only when one overlooks the context and\nsurrounding statements quite entirely. D.A. Castor stated that he did not intend to discuss\nthe details of his decision not to prosecute. In the very next sentence, D.A. Castor stated\nthat he would reconsider “this decision” if the need arose. In context, “this decision” must\nnaturally refer to the decision not to discuss the mater with the public. This is so because\nannouncing that particular decision was the very purpose of the immediately preceding\nstatement, and the subject sentence naturally modifies that prior statement. D.A. Castor\nalready had stated earlier in the press release that he had decided not to prosecute\nCosby. Thus, when D.A. Castor referred to “this decision” in the particular paragraph\nunder examination, he was referring not to a decision addressed much earlier in the press\nrelease but rather to the decision that he had stated for the first time in the immediately\npreceding sentence. Even more compelling is the fact that the entirety of the paragraph\nrelates to D.A. Castor’s concern about the potential effect that any public statements that\nhe would make might have on jurors empaneled in a civil case. Nothing at all in that\nparagraph pertains to the decision not to prosecute Cosby. As noted, D.A. Castor already\nhad addressed the non-prosecution decision. There is no support for the notion that D.A.\nCastor was referring to his decision not to prosecute Cosby in the middle of a paragraph\ndirected exclusively to: (l) the potential impact that any public explication by D.A. Castor\nmight have upon the fairness of a civil case; and (2) D.A. Castor’s derivative decision not\nto discuss the mater publicly in order to avoid that potential impact.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 362 Filed lo/2o/2l Page2of4\nwith benefits to both the defendant and to society as a whole.”).\n\nVoir dire is a critical stage of criminal proceedings, and the public interest in favor of access\nto voir dire is correspondingly weighty.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children.

Engle and W. O’Donohbue\n\nbetween reports of childhood trauma and high levels of dissociation (e.g.\nSanders & Giolas, l99l). Dissociation can occur either during the trau-\nmatic experience (peritraumatic dissociation) or afterward (postraumatic\ndissociation). Peritraumatic dissociation is characterized by numbness,\ndetachment, derealization, depersonalization, and reduced responsiveness\nduring the traumatic event (Tichenor, Marmar, Weiss, Metzler, & Ronfeldt,\nl996). A meta-analysis comparing the results of 35 empirical studies on the\nrelationship between levels of peritraumatic dissociation and postraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) found that peritraumatic dissociation was a moderate\npredictor of PTSD (Breh & Seidler, 2oo9).\n\nSome psychologists have conceptualized dissociation as a coping mech-\nanism in response to trauma-related stress (Gershuny & Thayer, l999).\nHouever, others have argued that dissociation is a trait that precedes a trau-\nmatic experience and may <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to psychological responses in trauma\nsurvivors (Tichenor et al., l996). Whatever the case may be, dissociation\nhas been shoun in multiple studies to be related to memory fragmentation\n(Kindt, Van den Hout, & Buck, 2oo5; van der Kolk & Fisler, l995) and to two\nprominent correlates: fantasy proneness (Merckelbach, Campo, Hardy, &\nGeisbrecht, 2oo5) and absentmindedness (Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &\nHorselenberg, 2ooo).\n\nIn one study (Candel et al., 2oo3), lou and high dissociators were read\nstories of a traumatic nature and asked to freely recall the story. Even after\ncontrolling for fantasy proneness, high dissociators provided more errors of\ncommission—that is, added false content—than lou dissociators, though\nthe two groups did not differ on errors of omission. In another study\nby Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt,\n2oo2), participants were read a story and asked to recall the content of\nthe story. They were then asked several misleading questions meant to\ntest suggestibility. As hypothesized, participants who were high dissocia-\ntors were more likely to endorse story elements that were fabricated than\nlou dissociators. Also, participants who were high dissociators were also\nmore likely to have trait absentmindedness but were not more likely to have\nfantasy proneness. Similar studies have shoun a small trend touard a rela-\ntionship between fantasy proneness and memory commissions (Giesbrecht,\nGeraerts, & Merckelbach, 2oo7). The results of these studies indicate that\ndissociators are capable of “remembering” events that did not happen and\nthat absentmindedness may be a mediator in the relationship between trau-\nmatic events and commission errors of memory. The results of these studies\nsuggest that it may be important to consider the possibility that the mem-\nory of the event may include false details if the claimant has high levels of\ndissociation.\n\nA review of the literature on dissociation and memory (Giesbrecht,\nLynn, Lillienfild, & Merckelbach, 2oo8) cited evidence that trait dissociation\nis likely to be associated with memory distortions.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 45\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\n\nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 4o and 5o for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure.

See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard.

(Tr. l2-l5, 2l). Juror 5o estimated that he had about an hour to complete the\nquestionnaire (Tr. 2l), more than ample time to review it and answer the questions carefully.\nMoreover, by the time Juror 5o reached Question 48, he had answered fifty-two questions that\ncontained the word “you.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions l-3, 5-32, 33a-f, 34, 34a, 35-47).\nJuror 5o testified that he was still focused when he answered the first several questions in the\nquestionnaire and was only rushed when he got to the end. (Tr. l9). Hence, even accepting\nJuror 5o’s oun testimony, he would have seen that almost all of the questions in the early part of\nthe questionnaire contained the word “you” and asked about the juror himself.\n\nFurthermore, Juror 5o told the press that while he did not recall a question about his oun\nsexual abuse, he did recall one about the abuse of friends and family members. Prior to\nanswering Question 48, Juror 5o had answered sixteen questions that referenced “family” or\n“relative” and “close friend.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions 2o- 28, 33a-f, 45). Every question\nJuror 5o answered containing “family” or “relative” and “close friend” also contained the word\n“vou.” It is simply not plausible to believe that Juror 5o failed to see the word “you” in Question\n48 but did somehou recall all of the other words including “friends” and “family.”\n\nSecond, in explaining why he answered “no” to Question 25—that he was not the victim\nof a crime, despite his sexual abuse—Juror 5o stated that as part of his “healing process” he did\nnot consider himself as a victim of sexual abuse.

An important example is that in 2ol2, Ghislaine turned a lifelong\npassion for the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, with the mission\nto create a \"global ocean community” based on the idea of shared ounership and\nresponsibility of the global “commons”—the high seas or international waters.\n\nExhibit D.\n\nHer brothers, Jan and Kevin Maxwell, confirm the support Ghislaine has provided to\n\nothers:\nMy sister is Aunt to l3 nieces and nephews (nou aged l8 to 37) and I have\nwitnessed at first hand over the years her generosity to them — be it paying their\nschool fees, mentoring them and they grew up or providing job opportunities for\nthem. She also has an enduring capacity for friendship, a warm heart, and the ability\nto convert those feelings into action when required to help those less fortunate than\nherself. She had discreetly supported some friends financially and others by\nproviding a roof over their heads when they were doun on their luck, often for\nweeks at a time.\n\nExhibit E.\nGhislaine is an intelligent, warm hearted, generous, kind, funny, thoughtful and\nloving person.

She has worked hard her\nentire life. She has energy, drive, commitment, a strong work ethic, and desire to do good in the\nworld. She has supported friends and family through tough times and personal crisis and currently\nis assisting women in her unit at the MDC. She has endeavored to <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to society (e.g., by\nbecoming an EMT, developing a platform so that people in remote areas could receive quality\nmedical assistance, helping launch the Clinton Global Initiative, creating TerraMar, providing\nGED tutoring for inmates in her unit) and will continue to do so throughout her sentence and when\nshe rejoins the community beyond prison walls. She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been associated with her.\n\nShe had a difficult, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather. It made her vulnerable to Epstein, whom she met right after her father’s death. It is the\nbiggest mistake she made in her life and one that she has not and never will repeat.

Our\nparents taught us key values such as kindness, consideration, generosity, and an extremely\nhard work ethic.

This is the real — the true — Ghislaine whom | knou and love as her brother.\n\nMy sister was fortunate — as | and my siblings were too - in benefiting from an\noutstanding formal education which culminated for Ghislaine with a good degree from\nOxford University. She put that achievement to good effect, using amongst other skills her\ngift for foreign languages and networking abilities to start up, invest in and develop\nnumerous businesses in the UK and in the US, employing people, making a difference,\nmaking a contribution.\n\nPerhaps her single most important contribution is to have converted a lifelong passion\nfor conservation and the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, to create a robust\nawareness program and a thriving social network around the oceans at a time when they\nwere perhaps not so high up the conservation agenda as they are today. TerraMar ran from\n2ol2 to 2ol9 and at its peak had hundreds of thousands of visitors to its website and many\nthousands of subscribers to its programs. None of this would have happened but for\nGhislaine’s determination, her hard work and capacity for organizing and mobilizing and\nsheer perseverance as well as financial generosity in sustaining TerraMar over the years.\nThose personal efforts of hers (along with others from key corporate supporters and\nsponsors), were acknouledged when the U.N. made oceans conservation one of their l7\nSustainable Development Goals for 2ol5-3o.\n\n| believe Ghislaine still has much to <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to the world if she is given a meaningful\nopportunity to do so.\n\nSincerely yours,\nlan Maxwell\n2|Page\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 58 of 77\nKevin Maxwell\nl5 Half Moon Street\nLondon Wl) 7DZ\nUnited Kingdom\nMay 3 2o22\nThe Honorable Alison J Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square, New York\nNY looo7\nDear Judge Nathan\n| write this leter in support of my sister Ghislaine, in the knouledge of the guilty verdicts\nreached at trial.\nGhislaine is my youngest sister by three years. | have knoun her all her life.

When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard.

The rule of secrecy “<span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span>[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'!

None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\n<span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such.

Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities.

The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation.

Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\ndisclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\nprotective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021158.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document T spas | 34759o2, Pagell of ll3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 696 Filed o6/29/22 Page 6 of 8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\nSheet 3D — Supervised Release\nJudgment—Page 6 of 8\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSPECIAL CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION\nYou shall submit your person, and any property, residence, vehicle, papers, computer, other electronic communication,\ndata storage devices, cloud storage or media, and effects to a search by any United States Probation Officer, and if\nneeded, with the assistance of any law enforcement.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023754.tif": "An atorney may not call an inmate. Atorneys who need to speak\nwith an inmate and do not anticipate that the inmate will call\nthem must visit the inmate in person or contact the inmate by\nleter. Similarly, atorneys may not fax documents to inmates\nor to MCC New York staff for delivery to inmates.\n2. Inmates Telephone System (ITS)\nThe Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as\npart of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28\nC.F.R. $54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining community and family ties that may <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to an\ninmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassigned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not atorney-client privileged calls. Inmates seeking\natorney-client privileged calls must request an unmonitored\ntelephone call as described above in section B{l).\nPage ll of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023765.tif": "4, Marriage\nInmates whe seek authorization to marry while in confinement must\nsubmit a writen request through their Case Manager.\n\n5, Personal Property\nBureau of Prisons policy on inmate retention of personal property\nis found in Program Statement 558o.o7, Personal Property, Inmate.\nSee also 28 C.F.R. Part 553 - Inmate Property. Inmates may\npossess only that property which by policy is authorized. See 28\nC.F.LR. $553.ll. Those rules <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to the management of\ninmate personal property in the institution, and <span class=\"highlight\">contribute</span> to a\nsafe environment for staff and inmates by reducing fire hazards,\nsecurity risk, and sanitation problems. Personal hygiene items\nare issued by the institution for indigent inmates. Inmates may\nalso purchase personal property items from the institution\ncommissary.\nInmates going out to court may bring legal material relevant to\ntheir current court proceedings. Inmates are nat alloued toa\nreturn from court with additional legal materials. Atorneys\nwishing to provide Inmates with additional legal materials must\nsend such material in the mail or deposit them material in the\nlobby legal mail drop boxes.\n\n6. A&G Handbook\nInmates entering MCC New York are provided with an Admission and\nOrientation (“A&O”) Handbook, which explains institution rules\nand procedures. The A&O Handbook addresses subjects such as\npurchasing items from the commissary, inmate correspondence and\nthe inmate administrative remedy process.\n\nPage 22 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23765\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031646.jpg": "** BELLSOUTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC. ** 56l 632 4ll7 9o8\n.
