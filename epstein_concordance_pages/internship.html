While at FIT, I took advantage of different volunteer opportunities and internships in\nthe fashion industry to provide a foundation for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a\nChristmastime <span class=\"highlight\">internship</span> at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as\na part-time employee. I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.\n\nIn the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where\nshe was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was\nelectrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,\nof difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of hou we both saw New York as a\nchance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)\nwas Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which ouned Henri Bendel\nat the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have\nto carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later\nthat day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel\nclose by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted\nme to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they\nsexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I returned to my classes at FIT and\ncontinued work at Henri Bendel, but I started to crack. I failed a course that was necessary for my\ndegree and had to retake it to get my diploma.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo72o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 73 of lol 73\nM6SQmaxsSl\n\nl Maxwell is today the same woman I met almost 2o years\n2 ago, incapable of compassion and human common decency.
