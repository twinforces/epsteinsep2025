According to Krischer,\ndefense counsel had proposed that registration be\ndeferred, and that Epstein register only if state or\nfederal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> felt, at any point during his\nservice of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta\nabout this proposal but had not heard back from him.\nVillafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.”\nVillafana told OPR that, to her knouledge, Acosta\ncalled Krischer to tell him that registration was not a\nnegotiable term.!”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for\ninformation about the amount of “gain time” Epstein\nwould earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her\nemail that she wanted to include a provision in the\nNPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at\nleast a certain number of days to make sure he doesn’t\ntry to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\n\n6 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having\ninteractions with Acosta regarding the Epstein case or any other\nmater.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000209.jpg": "g\n\nCentral District of California: “This agreement\nis limited to the [Central District of California] USAO\nand cannot bind any other federal, state, local, or foreign\nprosecuting, <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, administrative, or regulatory\nauthorities.” United States v.

See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. There is no legitimate\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000292.jpg": "; Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6-l Filed o7/ll/l9 Page3ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-62 Entered on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 3 of |\nof Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n|\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting, |\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had |\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a |\ncommercial sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c}(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office; |\n|\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure; |\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

See, e.g., July ll, 2oo8 Hr’g Tr. at 6-7\n(seeking an “[o]rder that the [non-prosecution] agreement that was negotiated is invalid” so that\nPetitioners can exercise the right to confer with the government); id. at l9-2o, 24; l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(5); see also DE l at 2 7 5 (claiming that Petitioner was “denied her rights” under the\nCVRA because she “received no consultation with the atorney for the government regarding the\npossible disposition of the charges”’).\n\nNotwithstanding the Non-Prosecution Agreement, Petitioners are and have been free to\nconfer with atorneys for the government about the investigation and potential prosecution of\nEpstein. At least one atorney for the government (Assistant United States Atorney Villafafia\nfrom the USAO-SDFL) had spoken to Petitioners about the offenses commited against them by\nEpstein prior to the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, see, e.g., July ll, 2oo8 Hr’g Tr.\nat 22 (acknouledging that prosecutors spoke to Petitioners “about what happened” to them); DE\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo3l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000317.jpg": "Case Si eae ese NDE See Ee driled S7/ DdeRet d7ans/aGief IBage l3 of\nbeen curtailed by the Non-Prosecution Agreement — to discuss the possibility of pursuing federal\ncriminal charges against Epstein.'* Nothing precludes Petitioners from doing so, and there is\nnothing to indicate that Petitioners’ wishes to confer with government atorneys in those districts\nwould be rebuffed in any way.

A).\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that classification louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000351.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page9oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\nharassed both [redacted] in connection to this atempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process\nall in violation of l8 USC l5l2(d)(l).”> Doe v.

It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

Police Report\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach\npolice report, which was annexed to the Government’s July l2, 2ol9 detention memorandum. At\nthe Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report\npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the\npolice report is atached as Exhibit A.\n\nIll. Foreign Passport\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently\nlearned that law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the\n“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence during the execution of a\nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2ol9. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to\ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto\nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States\npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign\nPassport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the\nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant.

The Court inquired as to the value\nof these items. After conferring with law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents who have reviewed the materials\nfrom the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $7o,ooo in cash. In\naddition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately l carat\nto 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether\nthe defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other\nlocations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the\njurisdiction at a moment’s notice.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2ol9 and July l2, 2ol9\ndetention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the\ndefendant be detained pending trial.

To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n\n‘Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.\n\n? Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo766", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000769.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of5\nBSF\naffirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000799.jpg": "Cas@’4Sfol4-4648o-RMEDbeuMenPsH Piles KV lSu82ged GeO 6 dF 33 |\n|\nvictim that] she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating with |\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.” Id.

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government.

On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access.

The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo962", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000975.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAURDSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA 872o Pagerrs of 26o\nout of public view after Epstein’s arrest, which the government seeks to portray as “hiding”\nfrom the law. The government further argues that she has taken several steps to avoid\ndetection, including moving residences and switching her phone and email address. (Gov.\nMem. at 8). But Ms. Maxwell did not take these steps to hide from law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or\nevade prosecution. Instead, they were necessary measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo975", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000991.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Dibeu tet 22o 2F il e@ OFAL8) 26a geageo’ 2o9\ncharges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from\n2ool to 2oo7, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations\nof statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo99l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000992.jpg": "Cesed 2o-€f Qo36GosAUut Dibeu tet 22o 2Ft il S@ OF ALG) 26a Geargec8 2Ho9\nappear to depend on any job — or to have depended on any employment in the past 3o years — for\nthe privileged lifestyle she has maintained for the entirety of that period. The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo992", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000993.jpg": "Cesed 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Dibeu tet 22o 2Ft il ed OF ALG) 26a Geagecs 2Ho9\nmake purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government announced\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difterence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her).

Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n(Tr. 32-34).

(Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll27", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001134.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd36couAut Dibeudre/Ntl $7o 2A il o 42ARM 26acgeadGs 36 BHA5\n\nThe discovery also does not contain any police reports in which the people we\nbelieve to be the complainants reported the alleged crimes to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.

That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice.

The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55).

In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted. (See Tr. 87).\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001215.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRO DOciuINe rt l/26 2 FileebBaASO/RagP a4 @6l6h22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services.

Jd. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that detention was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25—29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001228.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Deke Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a geageol J G6 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool228", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001336.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel9 of 25\n\n35.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l8 of 26\n837 F.2d 48, 49-5o (2d Cir. l988) (overturning district court’s decision that defendant posed\na flight risk based in part on the ground that the defendant took “no steps” to flee\njurisdiction in three-week period between execution of search warrant at home and arrest);\nUnited States v. DiGiacomo, 746 F. Supp. ll76, ll79-8o (D. Mass. l99o) (concluding\ndefendants did not present a flight risk because each of them “for three years knew there\nwas substantial evidence of the likely charges against them and did not atempt to flee\nbefore indictment’).\n\nIndeed, the absence of any allegation by the government that Ms. Maxwell was\ntaking steps to leave the country at the time of her arrest is conspicuous. The government\nhas offered no proof that she was making plans to leave the country. In fact, had the\ngovernment alerted her counsel that she was about to be arrested, we would have arranged\nfor Ms. Maxwell’s prompt, voluntary surrender. Instead, the government arrested Ms.\nMaxwell without warning on the day before the July 4 holiday, thus ensuring that she\nwould be in federal custody on the one-year anniversary of Epstein’s arrest.\n\n@, Ms. Maxwell’s Actions to Protect Herself From Intrusive Media\nCoverage and Death Threats Do Not Demonstrate an Intent to\nFlee\n\nFurthermore, the steps Ms. Maxwell took to leave the public eye after Epstein’s\narrest are not indicative of a risk of flight. The government notes that Ms. Maxwell dropped\nout of public view after Epstein’s arrest, which the government seeks to portray as “hiding”\nfrom the law. The government further argues that she has taken several steps to avoid\ndetection, including moving residences and switching her phone and email address. (Gov.\nMem. at 8).

In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001618.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 8 of l9\nappear to depend on any job — or to have depended on any employment in the past 3o years — for\nthe privileged lifestyle she has maintained for the entirety of that period. The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001619.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 9 of l9\nmake purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government announced\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difference between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 27 Filed o7/2l/2o Page l of 7\n2) Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nJeffrey Pagliuca\nHADDON\nMook oe N l5o East loth Avenue\nSOUS ee be Denver, Colorado 8o2o3\nPH 3o3.83l.7364 Fx 3o3.832.2628\nwww.hmilaw.com\njpaglisca@hmfilaw.com\nJuly 2l, 2o2o\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v.

Regardless, after Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent\nWilliam Sweeney went even further, calling Ms. Maxwell “one of the villains in this\ninvestigation” and compared her to a snake that “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New\nHampshire.” Thus, Mr. Sweeney offers the Government’s, again flatly wrong, opinions about\ncharacter and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a semi-biblical reference involving a snake\nslithering away to a garden in New Hampshire. These types of comments, which serve no\ncompelling law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this\nDistrict.\n\nNew York atorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several\nwitnesses in this mater, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in\nrecent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.l, which\napplies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically.\nSee Rule 23.l(a) and (b).\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited\nsubject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in\nviolation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:\n\nBoies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as\n\nshe looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence.\n\nMaxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with\n\nother wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with\n\nunderaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public\n\nstature who were involved with Epstein.”4\nMs. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go\naway but today is a step touard healing.” /d.\n\nBradley Edwards, another atorney representing witnesses in this mater made similar\npresumptively prejudicial statements follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°\n\n‘The reality of hou this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was\n\norchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual satisfaction.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001747.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5l Filed o9/o2/2o Page lof5\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #;\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: _ 9/2/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant. OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case.

This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review.

That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, financial records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001847.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 8l Filed l2/o3/2o Page--oef2. :\nUSDC SDN¥\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/3/2o _}\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002010.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 38 of 45\n\nThe discovery also does not contain any police reports in which the people we\nbelieve to be the complainants reported the alleged crimes to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn December l6, 2o2o, the Government filed its opposition to Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s renewed application for bail. In accordance with this Court’s December 7, 2o2o\nOrder, see Dkt. No. 89, the Government filed its materials under seal and proposed narrouly\ntailored redactions on those materials. The Defendant did not file any opposition to the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions.\nThe Court will adopt the Government’s proposed redactions after applying the three-part\ntest articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are\n“Judicial documents;” (ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the\nmaterials; and (ll) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at\nll9-2o. “Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd.\nat l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo IT’), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test.

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 2o of 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. As set forth in\nExhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the\nextradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for\nwhich extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

(See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 25 of 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.’ The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are\n“Judicial documents;” (ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the\nmaterials; and (il) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at\nll9-2o. “Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd.\nat l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo IT”), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant’s\nsubmissions are “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 6 of 22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services. /d. at 2-3.\nFurthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who\nwould prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or\nPretrial Services and who would escort her when she is authorized to leave. /d. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that detention was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo—l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25-29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34—\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2238", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l9 of 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“Te]ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4-87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4—88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(@), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo225l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l2 of l9\nsubstantive crimes when the false declarations “concern the substantive offenses.” Potamitis,\n739 F.2d at 79l. Such cases typically involve situations where the defendant was aware that he\nwas being investigated and either lied to the grand jury or made false statements to law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers in an effort to thwart the existing investigation into the other offenses with\nwhich he was charged. See, e.g., id. at 789-9o (joinder of perjury, false statements, and\nobstruction of justice counts proper where defendant made false statements to FBI agents and\nperjured himself in the grand jury); see also id. at 79l (collecting cases).\n\nHere, the circumstances are very different and joinder is not appropriate. The\ngovernment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell lied to the grand jury or the FBI to derail its\ninvestigation into the conduct underlying the Mann Act Counts. Instead, it alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements in two depositions in an unrelated civil defamation action which\noccurred in April and July 2ol6. Moreover, although the government alleges that some of the\nquestions posed at the depositions related to some of the alleged victims in this case (Indictment\n{| 2, 8), the questions were tangential to the defamation action, which was based on Ms.\nMaxwell’s denial of a purported conspiracy with Epstein from l999-2oo2 involving Ms. Giuffre.\nThe alleged false statements underlying the Perjury Counts therefore do not “concern” the Mann\nAct Counts and cannot be joined as part of a “common scheme or plan.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at\n79l.\n\nThe government makes only a half-hearted, and ineffective, atempt to allege a\nconnection between the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a).\nParagraph 2 of the Indictment alleges:\n\n[I]n an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned\n\nabout her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described\n\nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2ol6.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo229o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l32 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 2\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at\nl2o (quoting United States v.

Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y). A Protective\nOrder entered in that case prohibited the parties and their lawyers from sharing confidential\ndiscovery material (including the two Maxwell depositions) with anyone else, including with the\ngovernment and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. Faced with that Protective Order, the government issued a\nOO —CSCSCSCSCi‘s\nSES l3) proceeding ex parte, the government\nensured that no one before the court would be able to contest the accuracy of its representations\nin support of its application.\n\nThe government then took full advantage.\nOO —SSC‘\nOO —CSCSCSCSC‘ieie‘\nOO —SSCSCSCSSCies\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C‘C‘i\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘(‘CCCS\nOO ——SCSCis\nOO —CtisSCSCSCies«S\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\n\nGiuffre, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill batle—even she\nwas constrained to acknouledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 46, 5l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (explaining that discovery was “hard-fought” and “extensive” and\nnoting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery,\ntotals in the “thousands of pages”).\n\nGiuffre sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about\nMaxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual maters. Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between\nthe parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective\nOrder included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party’s confidentiality\ndesignation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any\ninformation or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case setled before trial, that sole\nexception to the Protective Order was never triggered.)\n\nNotably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>” exception to the Protective\nOrder, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against\nMaxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that\n“CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the\npreparation and trial of this case and any related mater, including but not limited to,\ninvestigations by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.” Ex. B J l(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Maxwell flatly rejected\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2355", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 23\nexpressly invoked the assurances of the Protective Order. So did the district court in permiting\nthese intrusions and ordering Maxwell to sit for a second deposition. Maxwell likewise relied on\nthe Protective Order in choosing to render such intimate details, rather than assert her Fifth\nAmendment privilege as she had every right to do.\n\nAnd why shouldn’t Maxwell have relied on the Protective Order? The central protection\nin the Order was that none of Maxwell’s answers could be disclosed to the government. Boies\nSchiller had expressly sought a law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> exception but was rebuffed. Instead, the law\nfirm was required either to return the confidential material or, at Maxwell’s option, to destroy it.\nMaxwell had every reason to take that assurance seriously, even if J did not.\n\n2. The government circumvented the protective order.\n\nFaced with a duly entered Protective Order—which quite deliberately omited any “law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>” exception—the government had lawful options to pursue the confidential Giuffre\ndiscovery. It could have moved to intervene in the civil case and to amend the Protective Order.\nIt could have issued a subpoena for the materials and given Maxwell an opportunity to respond.\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 294. It could even have applied for a search warrant, assuming\n(counterfactually) that it could shou probable cause in support of such a warrant.\n\nThe government did none of those things. Instead, 3 7 7 _\nOO e—sSCSC‘i\n.

During his career, he worked\nin the police department's Organized Crime Vice and Narcotics Unit, the Department of Justice\nand Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office Internet Crimes Against Children Unit, and the Palm\nBeach County State Atorney’s Public Integrity Unit. He handled high profile cases and\ninstructed law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> personnel and civilian members of the community about criminal and\nnarcotics investigations. Throughout his career, Detective Recarey received more than l5o\ncommendations from the law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> community, including the Inaugural “Officer of the\nYear” Award by the Palm Beach Police Foundation in 2ol2. He was responsible for the design,\nimplementation and maintenance of the security camera systems throughout the Toun of Palm\nBeach.°\n\nDetective Recarey served as the lead detective from the Palm Beach Police Department\ncharged with investigating Jeffrey Epstein.

Prejudice Resulting from Prejudicial Media Reporting and Inappropriate\nPre-Trial Publicity.\n\nBeginning in 2oo5 and escalating in 2oll through the present, Ms. Maxwell has been a\npotential target of a group of personal injury lawyers who made millions of dollars suing Jeffrey\nEpstein or extorting those associated with him. The playbook was relatively simple: File\nincendiary pleadings in court to avoid defamation claims; provide the pleadings and background\ninformation to various media organizations; obtain alleged victim’s names and police reports\nfrom law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>; share information with potential claimants who hire the lawyers after\nreading or hearing the reports; file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein; get money from Mr. Epstein or\nassociates to setle; repeat. Once Mr. Epstein had setled all of these claims against himself and\nthe other individuals alleged to have been involved, a new play was necessary - try to invalidate\nthe NPA; and at the same time drum up litigation against Maxwell with the expectation that\neither Mr. Epstein would setle any new litigation to avoid being dragged into yet another case\nthat would further tarnish the reputation he was trying to rebuild or result in money directly from\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nFrom 2oll to 2ol9, Ms. Maxwell was the subject of millions of media stories, posts,\nblogs, podcasts, and comments that simply republished the same allegations that she correctly\nidentified as “obvious lies” in 2ol5. Once New York passed L. 2ol9, ch. ll, knoun as the Child\nVictims Act, the door was open to claimants who wanted to take advantage of Mr. Epstein’s\nvulnerability to file new lawsuits on stale allegations. At that point it easy to make copycat\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2522", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 4 of l4\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. Section 377l,\nDoe v. United States, Case No. 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2oo8). Another victim subsequently joined\nthe litigation as “Jane Doe 2.”\nil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2536", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of l4\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nTW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l4\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2546", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 22\n\nMaxwell had a legitimate expectation of privacy in her EE because\nshe reasonably sought to preserve them as private.

For another, Martindell does not speak to what shouing would have been\nrequired for the issuance of a subpoena, probable cause or something less. Even if a warrant weren’t\nrequired here, a shouing of probable cause was. See People v. Mason, 989 P.2d 757, 76o (Colo. l999)\n(noting jurisdictions that recognize an expectation of privacy in subpoenaed materials and that require a\nsubpoena duces tecum of such records to be supported by probable cause). Finally, of course, the\ngovernment didn’t comply with Martindell because it never gave Maxwell notice and an opportunity to\nquash the subpoena and to challenge the government’s misrepresentations through the adversary process.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo256o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 22\n\nNeither Miller nor Smith supports a conclusion that Maxwell had anything but a\nlegitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her I.

International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. and violated Maxwell’s\nrights.\n\nIn Martindell, the government tried to obtain deposition transcripts of twelve individuals\ndeposed in a private shareholders’ derivative lawsuit. 594 F.2d at 292—93. All twelve depositions\nwere taken “pursuant to a court-approved stipulation to the effect that the depositions should be\ntreated as confidential and used solely by the parties for prosecution or defense of the action.” Jd.\nat 292. Without seeking to intervene, and without serving a subpoena or warrant, the government\ncalled and then wrote to the district court to request access to the deposition transcripts. /d. at\n293. The government claimed that the deposition transcripts were relevant to its investigation of\nperjury, subordination of perjury, and conspiracy related to the l97o presidential election in\nChile. Jd. The government, “moreover, feared that unless it could obtain the deposition\ntranscripts, it would be unable to secure statements from the witnesses because they would claim\ntheir Fifth Amendment rights in any investigative interviews.” /d. The district court denied the\ngovernment’s request, “holding that the deposition testimony had been given in reliance upon the\nprotective order, thus rendering unnecessary invocation by the witnesses of their Fifth\nAmendment rights, that the requested turnover would raise constitutional issues, and that\nprinciples of fairness mandated <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the protective order.” /d. The government\nappealed, and the Second Circuit affirmed.\n\nThe Second Circuit was blunt in explaining the government’s missteps:\n\nThe government may not .. . simply by picking up the telephone or writing a leter\n\nto the court (as was the case here), insinuate itself into a private civil lawsuit\n\nbetween others. The proper procedure, as the government should knou, was either\n\nto subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a\n\ngrand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to\n\nquash or modify the subpoena, see Rule l7(c), or to seek permissive intervention\n\nin the private action pursuant to Rule 24(b), for the purpose of obtaining vacation\n\nor modification of the protective order.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2564", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 22\ncase and use her oun words against her. 594 F.2d at 294. The Fifth Amendment would mean\nnothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections\nbecause the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so\nwithout notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered\nwith the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the\nbasis of perjury charges.\n\nThat is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government\nsubpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a\ncivil proceeding. 7oo F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Oshatz (who had been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition) was deposed and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against\nself-incrimination on “the understanding that a protective order would preserve his Fifth\nAmendment rights.” /d. at 699. Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government’s\nsubpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the “government [had] not\nargued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some\nextraordinary circumstances or compelling need.” /d. at 7ol.\n\nHere, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on “the understanding that a protective order\nwould preserve” the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been\nindicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat\nwas the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> exception.\n(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require Giuffre to disclose any law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\ninvestigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to\npreserve Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment rights. Where this Court in Oshatz granted a motion to\nquash, here it should grant a motion to suppress.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2568", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nA.

The Government is required to observe high\nstandards of integrity and honorable conduct, and the supervisory pouer of the court is designed\nto insure that such standards are observed.”). Thus, plea agreements are construed “strictly\nagainst the government.” United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v. Vaval, 4o4 F.3d l44, l52 (2d Cir. 2oo5)). “Because such agreements involve\nwaivers of fundamental constitutional rights, “prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\nperformance.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (quoting Vaval, 4o4 F.3d at l53). Finally, “[t]he\nprosecutor's office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise\nmade by one atorney must be atributed . . . to the Government.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l9o\n(quoting Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o, l54 (l972)).\n\nThe government’s atempt to evade the NPA flies in the face of these time-honored, and\nhonorable, principles. Rather than stand behind the promises it made in the NPA, the\ngovernment tries to escape them by arguing that Ms. Maxwell has no standing to enforce them—\na position that is contradicted by the unambiguous text of the NPA as well as by clear precedent.\nThe government also tries to pretend that the NPA contains geographical and temporal\nlimitations that simply do not exist. In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the interpretation and <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou manufacture ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established principle that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution.

Ms. Maxwell Has Standing to Enforce the NPA.\n\nThe Second Circuit has long recognized that plea agreements may include promises of\nleniency for third parties. See, e.g., United States v. Clements, 992 F.2d 4l7, 4l9 (2d Cir. l993)\n(“it is nou clearly established in the Second Circuit that the government may impose conditions\nwhich relate to the conduct or treatment of others”); United States v.

Both states’ laws permit <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of a contract by a third-party\nbeneficiary where the parties to the contract intended to confer a benefit on the third party.\nSubaru Distribs. Corp. v. Subaru of Am., Inc., 425 F.3d ll9, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (applying New\nYork law); Bochese v. Toun of Ponce Inlet, 4o5 F.3d 964, 982 (llth Cir. 2oo5) (applying Florida\nlaw). Moreover, “[a]n intention to benefit a third-party may be gleaned from the contract as a\nwhole and the party need not be named specifically as a beneficiary.” Chen St. v.

In United\nStates v. Broun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2), the defendants\nrelied solely on their “subjective beliefs” and “implicit understanding” that they would not be\nprosecuted further in another district, which the court held irrelevant; they cited no “affirmative\nappearance” in support of their position, as Ms. Maxwell has. And in Russo, the court found it\nunnecessary to reach Annabi, but acknouledged that an “affirmative appearance” of an intent to\nbind other USAOs can be found even where a plea agreement does not contain an express\nstatement to that effect—an interpretation that supports Ms. Maxwell’s position that the NPA\nbinds the government here. Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626.\n\nc.

Advani\nEnters., Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyds, l4o F.3d l57, l62 (2d Cir. l998).

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government's interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\nEmergency Victim’s Petition for <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n: Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\nL In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\nE OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n” 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\na In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2636", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l4\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo264o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v. Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”).

Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 25\n\nNor does § 3283 apply to extend the statutes of limitations under Counts Three and Four.\nThose counts arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), which prohibits “transporting” minors across state\nlines “with intent that the [minor] engage in . . . any sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” (emphasis added).? Neither that offense nor a conspiracy to\n“transport” a minor with such intent necessarily entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283.

The Indictment Is Insufficient to Allege a Conspiracy as to Accuser-3.\n\nTo establish a § 2422(a) conspiracy violation, the government must shou that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to “knouingly persuade[], induce[], entice[], or coerce[] any individual to\ntravel in interstate or foreign commerce . . . to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996). To\nestablish a § 2423(a) conspiracy claim, the government must prove that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nto “knouingly transport[] an individual who ha[d] not atained the age of l8 years in interstate or\nforeign commerce . . . with intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a)\n(l994); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (l986).4\n\nThe government cannot shou that Ms. Maxwell conspired to commit either offense with\nrespect to Accuser-3. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in interstate or foreign\ncommerce, let alone that Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else enticed her or otherwise caused\nher to do so. While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated interstate or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose.

See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. But the\nGovernment advances no non-conclusory basis as to why its investigation at this stage of the\nmater would be imperiled by the disclosure of the information regarding hou it obtained the\ninformation in question, and the requested redactions are far from narrouly tailored. As a result,\nthe Court denies the Government’s redaction requests in pages l-l28 and denies its request to\nfile Exhibits 8 and 9 under seal, since those documents relate to this very issue and the same\nreasoning applies to them. The Court will give the Government an opportunity to seek more\ntailored redactions if it wishes and to specifically justify the ongoing need to redact the requested\ninformation and documents. By March 22, 2o2l, the Government may file a leter with the\nCourt—under seal, if necessary—justifying the specific redaction and sealing requests.\nAlternatively, by that date the Government can indicate that it will not seek to renew the request.\n\nFurthermore, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the redactions\ncontained in pages l87-l88 of the Government’s brief. While the Court previously had granted\nthe request to redact the same information, see Dkt. No. 99, the Court no longer sees a basis for\nkeeping this information under seal in light of the strong presumption of access. The information\ndoes not in itself contain any personally identifying information, and the Court concludes that\nany minimal threat of interference with the Government’s investigation through the disclosure of\nthis information is outweighed by the presumption of access that ataches to those portions.

While these same limitations are not repeated in the provision\nthat purports to immunize “co-conspirators,” these limitations apply with equal force across the\nagreement, because that is the only common-sense way to read the NPA. Indeed, and as noted\nabove in a related context, it would be exceedingly strange to interpret the “co-conspirator”\nprovision to extend broader immunity than Epstein negotiated for himself.\n\nThe defendant may assert that the “co-conspirator” provision has absolutely no limitations,\nbut such an argument would lead to absurd results. In particular, in arguing that the “co-\nconspirator” provision lacks any temporal or statutory limitations whatsoever, the defendant seems\nto claim that the NPA immunized her for future crimes including, for example, perjury offenses\nthat she is charged with commiting almost a decade after the NPA was executed. (Def. Mot. l at\n32 (“For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the\nindictment.”)). Although the defendant does not highlight this point in her motion—perhaps\nrecognizing hou absurd it would be—that is the natural consequence of her illogical interpretation\nof the NPA. Despite advancing an argument that strains common sense, the defendant cites no\ncase in which a court has interpreted a plea agreement to bar prosecution for crimes that pre- or\npost-dated the period covered by the agreement. The Government is aware of no such authority.\nSee United States v. Hallahan, 756 F.3d 962, 974 (7th Cir. 2ol4) (rejecting defense argument that\nplea agreement barred prosecution for subsequent bail jumping, and, in interpreting the\n° By its plain terms, the NPA did not immunize Epstein for his “background,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Mot. l at 27). This provision refers, instead, to a list of “offenses” under federal\nlaw. Indeed, it is unclear hou any plea agreement could immunize a defendant’s “background.”\nSimilarly, the fact that the USAO-SDFL interviewed Minor Victim-2 does not mean that this case\n“arose out of” the USAO-SDFL investigation, an assertion the defendant’s motion does not explain\nor support with evidence. As the Indictment makes clear, the events underpinning the Indictment\ninvolve multiple victims and specific legal charges that were not within the scope of the USAO-\nSDFL investigation.

The same holds true here.\n\nIn support of her claim that she has standing to enforce the NPA, the defendant relies upon\nthree district court decisions, none of which analyzed the threshold question of whether third party\nstanding concepts from contract law apply to plea agreements. In United States v. Florida West\nInt’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9, l228 (S.D. Fla. 2ol2), the district court applied the third\nparty beneficiary doctrine to a former airline employee based on a prior plea agreement with the\nairline that immunized, among others, current and former employees of the airline and its\nsubsidiaries. In its analysis, houever, the court applied the doctrine without analyzing the question\nof whether third party beneficiary standing principles apply to plea agreements. /d. For similar\nreasons, the defendant’s reliance on United States v. El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo, 6o8-o9 (N.D.\nOhio 2ool) is misplaced. In that case, the court permited a third party to invoke a plea agreement,\nbut it did not analyze or address whether third party standing rules apply to plea agreements. /d.\nLikewise, in United States v. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3 (D.S.C. l984), the court\napplied the third party beneficiary doctrine, but relied solely on contracts treatises for support, and\ndid not analyze whether that doctrine should be applied to plea agreements.\n\nIn any event, even if third party beneficiaries had standing to enforce federal plea\nagreements, the defendant has failed to establish that she is a third party beneficiary of the NPA.\nIn order to establish that she has enforceable rights under the NPA, the defendant must shou that\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 52 of 239\nViolent Crime Control and Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Act of l994, Pub.

Seting the defendant’s conspiracy theories aside, the\ncivil maters were in completely different procedural postures, which implicate different concerns\nregarding a pending criminal case. The Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation was setled and complete\nwell before the Government even opened its investigation in this case. By contrast, the Doe v.\nIndyke case was initiated after the Government opened its investigation and remained ongoing\nafter the Indictment in this case was filed.?? The defendant quotes the Government’s leter to Judge\nFreeman requesting permission to intervene and stay Doe v. Indyke (see id.), but omits the portion\nof that leter in which the Government explained that, as far as it was aware, Doe v. Indyke was\nthe “lone case in this District that has not yet been either resolved or stayed at this point... . In\n3 In particular, Giuffre v. Maxwell was resolved in 2ol7 and the determination of what material\nshould remain sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there is no more discovery to be\nconducted in the Giuffre case and no possible concern to the Government that, for example, its\ntrial witnesses in the criminal case might be deposed in that civil case. In Doe v. Indyke, on the\nother hand, discovery was just beginning, and if discovery were to have proceeded, multiple\nwitnesses or potential witnesses at the criminal trial would likely have been subject to deposition.\nThat concern, among others, raised a significant risk that proceeding with the civil mater would\nadversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecution against the defendant. Moreover, the interests\nof judicial economy and the public interest in <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the criminal law were served by a\nstay in the Doe case because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve disputed issues in the\nDoe case.

In response to Chief Judge McMahon’s question about the privacy\ninterests implicated by the protective order, (id. at l6-l7), the Government also noted that it was\ndissimilar to an ordinary third-party intervenor in that it would be “extremely restricted” in its use\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o3o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 239\n\nOn or about April 9, 2ol9, Chief Judge McMahon granted the Government’s application\nand issued a memorandum and order.

She evaluated\nthe factors under Second Circuit case law that are relevant to assessing whether a party’s reliance\non the protective order was reasonable, namely the scope of the protective order, the language of\nthe order itself, the court’s level of inquiry before granting the order, and the nature of reliance on\nthe order. (/d. at l7). She concluded that first three factors favored granting the Government’s\napplication for modification. (/d. at l7-2o). Chief Judge McMahon noted that, as the order\n“plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure to anyone—law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the absence of automatic\npermission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from a grand jury’s\nscrutiny.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\nAs to the last factor, Chief Judge McMahon found that “the nature of the parties’ reliance\non the order does seem to weigh against modification.” (/d. at 2o).

The Second Circuit found that the “deponents [had] testified in reliance upon [a]\nRule 26(c) protective order, absent which they may have refused to testify.” Jd. at 296. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit reasoned that the interest in the <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of Rule 26(c) protective\norders—which included securing just and speedy determination of civil disputes—was sufficient\nto outweigh the Government’s interest in obtaining information by means of an informal document\nrequest.

The Second Circuit held that “absent a shouing of improvidence in the\ngrant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling need, . .\n. a witness should be entitled to rely upon the enforceability of a protective order against any third\nparties, including the Government.” /d.; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated\nApr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d l22l, l224-25 (2d Cir. l99l) (“The Martindell test [ | does not transform\na protective order into a grant of immunity because the test allous a protective order to be\novercome by a shouing of improvidence in the grant of the order, extraordinary circumstances or\ncompelling need.”); Palmieri v.

Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v.

Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the protective order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her\nadversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation\nof privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is\nrevealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, l38 S. Ct.\nat 222o (“We do not disturb the application of Smith and Miller ...”). Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\nprotective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data\nServs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (“It is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling disclosure to anyone—law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at l8-l9); see\nalso Def. Mot. 3, Ex. A at § 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION|] shall not, without the\nconsent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o45", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 239\nmarks omited) (emphasis added)); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l45 (“It\nis undisputed that a district court retains the pouer to modify or lift protective orders that it has\nentered.”). It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\napplications in Fourth Amendment terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the application of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found an exception to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth Amendment protection.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new circumstances only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to Giuffre,” (Def. Mot. ll\n\n85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o46", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003048.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 239\nomited)). “As the rule seeks to deter future Fourth Amendment violations, the Supreme Court\nadvises district courts to only suppress evidence where it serves such a purpose.” United States v.\nWilliams, No. lo Cr. 622 (ADS), 2ol8 WL 4623ol7, at *4 (E.D.N.Y.

Asa result, exclusion should be a “last\nresort” rather than a “first impulse.” United States v. Rosa, 626 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited). The exclusionary rule should be used only where law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> “‘exhibit[s] deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth\nAmendment rights.”” United States v.

Indeed, the good faith exception does\nnot apply only in four narrou circumstances:\n\n(l) where the issuing magistrate has been knouingly misled; (2)\nwhere the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial\nrole; (3) where the application is so lacking in indicia of probable\ncause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4) where the\nwarrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable.\nUnited States v.

Mot. 5 at 8). As an initial mater, and as evidenced by the\ndefendant’s oun motions to suppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller,\nthe defendant herself professes to have been concerned about the prospect of a criminal\ninvestigation at the time of her depositions, which strongly suggests that, on these facts, the\ndistinction is of litle moment. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4 (explaining that the defendant “flatly\nrejected” a law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> exception to the civil protective order); Def. Mot. ll at 2 (arguing\nthat the defendant “declined to invoke” her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nat the deposition after negotiating the protective order)). More important, and whatever moment\nthat distinction may have in other contexts, it has litle bearing on the severance analysis which\nturns instead on whether the substance of the false statement relates to the substantive offense, and\nis thereby provable through overlapping evidence and part of the speaker’s effort to conceal the\noffense. See Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5; Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l (citing United States v. Carson,\n464 F.2d 424, 436 (2d Cir. l972); Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9) (affirming denial of a severance\nmotion where the false statements “concern the substantive offenses” and citing cases where the\nperjury count’s proof overlapped with the evidence on the substantive counts). With respect to\nthat analysis, the defendant cites no case for the proposition that the seting in which the statement\nis made is significant, much less determinative. Cf Broccolo, 797 F.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 348\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW <span class=\"highlight\">ENFORCEMENT</span> AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 348\nor other divisions having responsibility for specific criminal <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, such as the Civil Rights\nDivision. In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.\n\nDuring the period most relevant to this Report, the Atorney General was Michael\nMukasey, the Deputy Atorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Atorney General for\nthe Criminal Division was Alice Fisher. The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterban.\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal\nmaters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-\nDade, Brouard, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and\nHighlands, an area of over l5,ooo square miles. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nUSAO had a staff of approximately 2oo Assistant U.S. Atorneys (AUSAs) and 2oo support\npersonnel. The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief. During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm\nBeach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency\nand is part of the Department. It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Atorney’s Offices.\nThe FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, knoun\nas Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.\nThe Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach\nResident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent.

The State and Local Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nI. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 348\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher. Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafaia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4l of 348\ntold OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought atorney Alan Dershouitz to see Krischer and the\nAssistant State Atorney, but Dershouitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, “We’re going\nto destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.” According\nto Krischer, Dershouitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local atorney Jack\nGoldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.” Because the husband of the\nAssistant State Atorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the Assistant State\nAtorney to remove “even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took\nover the case. Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.”” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\n<span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3257", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 348\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®® Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003322.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3322", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo333o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 348\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “‘conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:7°°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nWI. THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.”**’ On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?°8\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n\n267 OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief’ to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA| applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.

We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6).

I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea. Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”°°! As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.?”\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea.

Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“It]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafia edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3436", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003443.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art.

See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8e Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.

Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\npersons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory privilege is particularly applicable\nto grand jury proceedings.”) (citations omited).\n\nFinally, even were the Court to apply the Martindell test here,* despite the significant\ndistinguishing factors described above, this Investigation is a paradigmatic example of\nextraordinary circumstances. In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash.

As described belou, a court can and should\nmodify a protective order, or permit limited relief from it, to allou the recipient of a grand jury\nsubpoena to comply with such a subpoena under the circumstances presented here.\nThe Court is best guided by the decision in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., l54\nF.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), which rejected an application for a party in civil litigation to be held\nin contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order,\nwithout first obtaining authorization from the court, because the court would have granted such\nauthorization had it been sought. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. As that court explained:\nThe role of the federal courts in law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, exemplified by\nthe Federal Criminal Code (Title l8, USC) and in enforcing Grand\nJury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information\navailable to <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities absent a countervailing\nshouing that the need for the information for such purposes is\noutweighed by the need for protecting expectations of\nconfidentiality under Fed.

Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 42l-22 (2d Cir. l983) (finding that the\n“conflict between protection of private material used in a civil proceeding and public need in a\ncriminal prosecution” posed in that case was “easily resolved” and explaining that “[a]bsent\napplicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no\nshiled protects the civil evidence” in that case “from compellable production before the grand jury\nwhich subpoenaed it”). The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun. Id.\nChemical Bank further described the types of interests that otherwise might be implicated\nin connection with a Rule 26(c) protective order, none of which are implicated here. Jd. at 94\n(“There is no indication that any difficult balancing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) would have been\nnecessary of interests of law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> against protection of technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals, since no such information has been claimed to have been contained in any of\nthe discovery materials in this case.”) (citations omited).!\n' Notably, here, and in contrast to other cases further described belou, the Government’s specific\nknouledge of the subject mater of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential\nnature of the Litigation; houever, the Protective Order itself indicates that discovery materials\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo355l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\nIndeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically rejected judicial protection for the type of\ninformation the Protective Order appears to cover in the Litigation:\n\nAvoiding embarrassment may be a reason for a party to seek\n\nconfidentiality. It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. l77) (defining\n“confidential” information as, in sum and substance, medical and psychological information,\npersonal identifying information, and information relating to sexual activity or sexual contact).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\npersons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory privilege is particularly applicable\nto grand jury proceedings.”) (citations omited).\n\nFinally, even were the Court to apply the Martindell test here,* despite the significant\ndistinguishing factors described above, this Investigation is a paradigmatic example of\nextraordinary circumstances. In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun.

In support of this motion, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nThroughout the pendency of this case Plaintiff repeatedly has represented to the Court\nand Ms. Maxwell that she is privy to, and part of, some ongoing criminal investigation in which,\nper Plaintiff's innuendo, Ms. Maxwell is a person of interest. For example, Plaintiff purports to\nbe withholding documents “relating to on-going [sic] criminal investigations by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nrelating to [Ms. Maxwell’s] conduct.” See Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendant’s\nMotion to Compel (Doc. #78) at 3. Plaintiff claims to be withholding “documents that concern\nor relate to any currently ongoing investigation by any law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency under the public\ninterest privilege and other applicable privileges.” Jd. at 4. According to Plaintiff, she “can\nimmediately provide clear evidence to this Court of hou [the purportedly ongoing] investigation\nwould be impaired...” /d. at ll. Further, Plaintiff refers to “the law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> inquiry that is\ncurrently underway,” id., representing to the Court that, in fact, there is an active investigation\nregarding Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not aware of any such investigation. Indeed, a review of the nou more\nthan a decade old police reports involving Mr. Epstein reflects that Ms. Maxwell was not a\nsuspect in any of the activity which resulted in any prosecution of Mr. Epstein. Counsel for Ms.\nMaxwell have atempted to learn about any investigation by contacting Assistant United States\nAtorney A. Marie Villafana, the Government lawyer handling the VRA litigation that Plaintiff\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3797", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003798.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- QF AAR VAD UME ALLSD , FRNA BEI29 |p ApecEks of 8\nApp.-ol34\nhas atempted to join. Ms. Villafana’s response was that she was unaware of any such\ninvestigation.\n\nPlaintiff also seems to be claiming that she is part of this alleged investigation and, as a\nconsequence, has inappropriately atempted to claim a non-existent “investigative privilege”\nwhich has been replaced by her equally inappropriate “public interest privilege.” Issues related\nto Plaintiff's ongoing failures to produce discovery, including her specious claims of privilege\nhave been raised and fully briefed. Ms. Maxwell incorporates her Motion to Compel Responses\nto Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests (Doc. # 75) and Reply in support thereof (Doc. #\n92), by reference.\n\nAccording to Plaintiff, Ms. Maxwell “cannot shou any significant reason for needing”\nthe information. This is, again, a meritless argument which ignores the fact that Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to the information under the rules of discovery. And, the “need” for the information is\nboth obvious and necessary for at least three reasons: first, any communications between\nPlaintiff, her lawyers and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> are likely inconsistent with statements Plaintiff has\nmade to the media; second, the statements will reflect Plaintiff's motive and bias in bringing this\nlitigation; and third, knouing the information will allou Ms. Maxwell to access the impact on\nany 5\" Amendment privilege. Plaintiff, at this point, should be either required to provide the\ninformation or accept a stay in the proceedings as a consequence of her failure to comply with\nher discovery obligations. She should not be alloued to brandish this, likely nonexistent, sword\nbut deny Ms. Maxwell the opportunity to adequately prepare for her deposition and other\ndiscovery maters. Accordingly, in the event that the Plaintiff continues to fail to reveal the\ninformation that she claims to have regarding some “ongoing criminal investigation,” Ms.\nMaxwell moves to stay these proceedings.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3798", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003802.jpg": "Case AQo7G-QPS3Qa2 AR VSD GSU AL2SD, FRHECIAA/ BG(S9 |B ApaGERS of 8\nApp.-ol38\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nI certify that on April l8, 2ol6, I electronically served this MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF\nTO DISCLOSE ALLEGED “ON-GOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS BY LAW\n<span class=\"highlight\">ENFORCEMENT</span> [sic] OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TO STAY PROCEEDINGS via ECF on\nthe follouing:\nSigrid S.

Nor did the allegedly false statements concern the Mann Act Counts, which are\nbased on allegations of enticing women to travel in interstate commerce for an illegal sexual\npurpose between l994 and l997. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to questions about, for example,\nwhether she could give a list of people under the age of l8 who came to Epstein’s house or\nwhether she could identify sex toys—which she made in the context of a 2ol6 defamation claim\nbrought by an unrelated person—do not “concern” the Mann Act Counts.\n\nThe government contends that the fact that Ms. Maxwell made these statements in the\ncontext of a civil deposition, as opposed to a criminal investigation, “is of litle moment” because\nshe was supposedly “concerned about the prospect of a criminal investigation at the time of her\ndepositions.” Resp. at l45.

If the defense were\nto put these documents at issue at trial, during either the defense case or the cross-examination of\nwitnesses, the Government reserves its right to use relevant materials from this set for any purpose\npermissible under the Rules of Evidence. Likewise, the Government has no objection to the\ndefense using these materials at trial for any permissible purpose under the Rules of Evidence,\nincluding to cross-examine trial witnesses.\n\nMoreover, the Government notes that, even if these materials were suppressed — which the\nGovernment submits is inappropriate here — the Government would nonetheless have the right to\noffer these materials under certain circumstances. For example, it is well established that a\ncriminal defendant who testifies in her oun defense may be impeached with materials that would\notherwise be subject to suppression. United States v. Trzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo26 (2d Cir. l997)\n(“The Supreme Court has held that illegally acquired evidence may be used to impeach defendants\nwho testify in their oun defense.”) (citing Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 64-66 (l954)).\nAs the Supreme Court has explained, the exclusionary rule must be balanced with the truth-seeking\nfunctions of a trial:\n\nIt is one thing to say that the Government cannot make an\n\naffirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is quite another\n\nto say that the defendant can turn the illegal method by which\n\nevidence in the Government’s possession was obtained to his oun\n\nadvantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction\n\nof his untruths. Such an extension of the Weeks doctrine would be\n\na perversion of the Fourth Amendment.\n' The Government further notes that many of the materials in the file in question are duplicates of\nmaterials the Government has obtained through other sources. For example, the file contains\nmaterials that appear to have been obtained from third parties and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies. At\ntrial, the Government is likely to offer documents it has obtained during its investigation through\nother sources, even though those materials happen to be contained in duplicate in the file in\nquestion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003974.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page3ofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

According to its so called “Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre’s Revised Supplemental\nPrivilege Log Dated April 29, 2ol6,” BSF refused to produce as privileged “approx. 57”\ndocuments that it identified as “correspondence re the currently ongoing criminal investigation of\nthe Defendant [Ms. Maxwell] and others.”!

Maxwell,” the\nproduction from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her pre-trial motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6. The peculiar failure of the government to produce these items\nin connection with the “entire” BSF file has yet to be explained. Clearly, BSF knew what the\nterms meant when it used them to block the production of this information in the civil litigation\nand it should not be alloued to profess confusion or ignorance here.\n\nThe cases cited by BSF are not helpful to its cause. For example, the court in United\nStates v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o),\nquashed the subpoena because it did “not satisfy the initial requirement of relevance.” In United\nStates v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), the defendant requested\n“any and all writings and records” related to the NYPD's contact with a particular confidential\nwitness who, according to the defendant, provided relevant information. The subpoena was\nunlimited in time or scope and, to the extent a time or scope were determined, production of the\ninformation was limited by l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. Jd. at 5l3.\n\nUnited States v.

Although investigation will vary depending on the\n\ncircumstances, it should always be shaped by what is in the client’s best interests,\n\nafter consultation with the client. Defense counsel’s investigation of the merits of\n\nthe criminal charges should include efforts to secure relevant information in the\n\npossession of the prosecution, law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities, and others, as well as\n\nindependent investigation.

Further\nthe privilege log does not, as the Defendant insinuates, reference communications between BSF\nand the U.S. Atorney as defined in the Subpoena, as the log references only an unspecified “law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency.” /d. at 4.\n\nB. The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated Relevance and Admissibility.\n\nThe Court’s analysis does not stop at specificity—Requests l through 5 independently fail\nbecause the Defendant has not demonstrated that all of the communications she seeks are relevant\nand admissible. The Defendant’s sole basis for contending that the wide array of communications\nshe seeks are all relevant to her defense is that the communications are relevant to “two motions\nto suppress based on misrepresentations made by the government to Chief Judge McMahon and a\nmotion to dismiss the indictment for prejudicial delay” because they “would establish the\nsubstance and frequency of the communications between BSF and the government prior to the\ngovernment’s end run around Martindell.” Resp. Ltr. at 6-7. But the Defendant has not met her\nburden of demonstrating relevance and admissibility.\n\nFirst, because Rule l7’s “purpose is trial-focused,” a Rule l7(c) subpoena “may be used\nonly to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial.” United States v. Louis, No. o4 Cr. 2o3\n(LTS), 2oo5 WL l8o885, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2oo5) (emphasis added); see also United States\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4oo5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page7of9\nSee United States v. Aguilar, No. CR o7-ooo3o (SBA), 2oo8 WL 3l82o29, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug.\n4, 2oo8). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary\nincentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are\nbeing sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be\nimpeachment evidence does not render them “relevant” for purposes of Rule l7(c); if at all, those\ndocuments would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538,\nat *2. Maxwell’s argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is\nexculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or\nwhen those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are\nexculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for\npurposes of cross-examination, leaving litle doubt as to the purported claim of relevance. And\nto the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be\nexculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why\nthat expectation might be reasonable. The “mere hope” that the documents may contain some\nexculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of a Rule l7(c) subpoena (or, as here,\nissuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-\n579 (SWK), l984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell’s reliance on cases\ninvolving the Government’s obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment\nevidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context. Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2-\n3. Maxwell thus fails to establish Request l2’s compliance with the Nixon standards. Maxwell\nmay renew her request for these documents once she identifies specific individuals whose\nsubmissions she seeks and spells out with specificity the relevance of all requested materials. At\nthat time, the Court will determine whether it is proper to require production of these materials to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o45", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page4of9\nPage 4\n\nGovernment has acknouledged. In other words, there will be no dispute at trial that Minor Victim-\n2 did not write about the defendant in her diary.!\n\nThe cases the defendant cites are inapposite. For instance, in United States v. Cheung Kin\nPing, 555 F.2d lo69 (2d Cir. l977), the parties learned that a cooperating witness kept a diary,\nwhich was largely writen in Chinese, while the witness was still on cross-examination. /d. at\nlo78. The witness turned over his diary, but after observing that the “defense was examining his\ndiary, .. . he requested that this not be done.” /d. While the parties were discussing hou to review\nthe diary, including for Brady material, the diary was returned to the witness. It was only given to\nthe defense for examination after “roughly five days” in the witness’s possession. /d. at lo79.\nAccordingly, in that case, a diary that had never been evaluated for Brady material—or any other\nmaterial—was taken from a witness in the middle of the witness’s cross-examination, then\nreturned to him for five days. The Second Circuit found that those events “created a serious risk\nthat significant material would be destroyed or tampered with.” /d. Here, in contrast, the diary\ncontains no relevant material—in fact, that is the defendant’s very thesis. See also White v.\nMcKinley, 5l9 F.3d 8o6, 8l4 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (explaining, in a § l983 case, that the plaintiff had\nalleged bad faith by stating that a law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officer in a child molestation case “deliberately\nsteer[ed] the investigation to benefit his love interest,” in part by “‘fail[ing] to preserve the alleged\nvictim’s diary which did not corroborate the molestation allegations,” which in turn “deprived [the\ndefendant] of his right to a fair trial, in part, because he could not testify about the diary without\nwaiving his right not to testify”); United States v.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 349\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW <span class=\"highlight\">ENFORCEMENT</span> AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4325", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29 of 349\nor other divisions having responsibility for specific criminal <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, such as the Civil Rights\nDivision. In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.\n\nDuring the period most relevant to this Report, the Atorney General was Michael\nMukasey, the Deputy Atorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Atorney General for\nthe Criminal Division was Alice Fisher. The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterban.\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal\nmaters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-\nDade, Brouard, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and\nHighlands, an area of over l5,ooo square miles. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nUSAO had a staff of approximately 2oo Assistant U.S. Atorneys (AUSAs) and 2oo support\npersonnel. The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief. During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm\nBeach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency\nand is part of the Department. It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Atorney’s Offices.\nThe FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, knoun\nas Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.\nThe Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach\nResident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent.

The State and Local Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 33 of 349\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher. Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.? Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by the U.S. Atorneys’ Offices\nand CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute\nindividuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.\n\n3 After the district court issued its February 2l, 2ol9 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government,\nthe Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo433o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 35 of 349\nWW. JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4332", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 42 of 349\ntold OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought atorney Alan Dershouitz to see Krischer and the\nAssistant State Atorney, but Dershouitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, “We’re going\nto destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.” According\nto Krischer, Dershouitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local atorney Jack\nGoldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.” Because the husband of the\nAssistant State Atorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the Assistant State\nAtorney to remove “even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took\nover the case. Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 68 of 349\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\n<span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4365", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo8 of 349\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l34 of 349\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l35 of 349\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®’ Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges.

The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7l of 349\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o4 of 349\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the nights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:*©°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nIl.

Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24l of 349\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6).

I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea.*°° Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”**! As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“Tt]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafa edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4558", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 268 of 349\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings. The 2oll revision\nremedied this omission.\n\n24l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4565", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 269 of 349\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”3®\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.*®°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA nights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA night\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\naB3 l57 Cong. Rec. 87359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\nae Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4566", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, t appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia.

While she\nstudiously avoids using the word, one such theory relates to impeachment. As this Court has\nnoted, the potential impeachment of a witness does not provide grounds for issuance or\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of a Rule l7(c) subpoena because such materials would only become relevant after\na witness has testified. United States v. Skelos, No. l5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at\n*2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases).\n\nThe other theory of relevance that Maxwell proffers is that if the rest of the journal does\nnot mention her, the journal as a whole may serve as exculpatory evidence. At best, the theory\namounts to litle more than a “fishing expedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See\nUnited States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698-7o (l974). In any event, the argument is too\nspeculative to meet the standard set forth in Nixon. To begin with, the request appears to be\noverbroad; under Rule l7(c), the moving party must shou that all of the requested material is\nrelevant. Cf United States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. l2, 2ol6). It appears from the briefing that the diary includes entries from before Minor\nVictim-2’s first time meeting Epstein or Maxwell. Maxwell does not explain why the absence of\nreferences to her in those entries would be relevant, and she provides no other basis as to the\nrelevance of any portions of the diary that precede her meeting Epstein or Maxwell. And here,\ntoo, the theory that the rest of the journal contradicts Minor Victim-2’s anticipated testimony as\nto specific incidents is, in its nature, targeted at impeaching the alleged victim’s anticipated\ntestimony.\n\nIn addition, Maxwell does not plausibly establish the relevance of the rest of the diary\nother than the pages she has already received.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2, 2o2l\nPage 2\nafter the assault; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil atorneys to pursue financial\ncompensation through a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at 9-lo).\nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he\nviewed as, and Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never\nbe prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 8o\nwith the Montgomery County Detective Bureau and the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office to investigate Constand’s allegation.\n\nSergeant Schaeffer first spoke with Constand by telephone on January l9, 2oo5.\nAccording to Sergeant Schaeffer, Constand seemed nervous throughout this brief initial\ninterview. Thereafter, Constand traveled from Canada to Cheltenham to meet with the\ninvestigating team in person. Because this was Constand’s first time meeting with law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> personnel, she felt nervous and uncomfortable while discussing with them\nthe intimate nature of her allegations.\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then-Montgomery County District Atorney Bruce Castor\nissued a press release informing the public that Cosby was under investigation for sexual\nassault. Sergeant Schaeffer and other law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officials interviewed Cosby in\nNew York City, utilizing a writen question and answer format. Cosby was accompanied\nby his atorneys, Walter M. Phillips, Esquire, and John P. Schmit, Esquire. Cosby\nreported that Constand had come to his home at least three times during their social and\nromantic relationship. Cosby claimed that, on the night in question, Constand came to\nhis house complaining of an inability to sleep. Cosby stated that he told Constand that,\nwhen he travels, he takes Benadryl, an antihistamine, which immediately makes him\ndrousy. According to Cosby, he then handed Constand one-and-a-half Benadryl pills,\nbut did not tell her what they were.\n\nCosby recalled that, once Constand ingested the pills, they kissed and touched\neach other on the couch. Cosby admited that he touched Constand’s breasts and vagina,\nbut he insisted that she neither resisted nor told him to stop. Additionally, Cosby told the\ninvestigators that he never removed his clothing and that Constand did not touch any part\nof his body under his clothes. Cosby denied having sexual intercourse with Constand\nand disclaimed any intent to do so that night.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\nthe need arise.

Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>’s ability to collect physical evidence.

Follouing that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.\nCastor spoke to [Cosby’s] atorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told\nMr. Castor that during the year between the assault and the report, Ms.\nConstand had multiple phone contacts with [Cosby]. Mr. Phillips was also\nconcerned that Ms. Constand had recorded phone calls with [Cosby]. Mr.\nPhillips told Mr. Castor that if he obtained the phone records and the\nrecorded calls he would conclude that Ms. Constand and her mother were\natempting was to get money from [Cosby] so they would not go to the\npolice.

He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that\ncould not be overcome.\nMr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in\nexchange for Mr. Cosby not being prosecuted.” Mr. Castor testified that he\ntold Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the\nanalysis and directed her to contact Constand’s atorneys.

Instead,\nCosby presented a narrative of a consensual sexual encounter with Constand, which he\nasserted again later in his depositions. “Thus,” the trial court explained, “there was\nnothing to indicate that [Cosby’s] cooperation would cease if a civil case were filed.” /d.\nat 65.

Specifically, the court noted that Cosby was represented at all\ntimes by a competent team of atorneys, but none of them “obtained [D.A.] Castor’s\npromise in writing or memorialized it in any way.” /d. at 65-66. The failure to demand\nwriten documentation was evidence that no promise not to prosecute was ever extended.\nFor these reasons, the trial court found no legal basis to estop the Commonwealth from\nprosecuting Cosby.\n\nCosby filed a notice of appeal and a petition for review with the Superior Court. In\nresponse to the filings, the Superior Court temporarily stayed the proceedings belou.\nHouever, upon a motion by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court quashed the appeal\nand lifted the stay.

On appeal to this Court, Zuber argued\nthat he was “induced by the specific promise made by the Commonwealth,” which\nultimately turned out to be a “false and empty one.” /d. We noted that plea bargaining is\nlooked upon favorably and that “the integrity of our judicial process demands that certain\nsafeguards be stringently adhered to so that the resultant plea as entered by a defendant\nand accepted by the trial court will always be one made voluntarily and knouingly, with a\nfull understanding of the consequences to follou.” /d.\n\n[T]here is an affirmative duty on the part of the prosecutor to honor any and\n\nall promises made in exchange for a defendant’s plea.

The applicability of\ncontract law to aspects of the criminal law has been recognized by the Supreme Court of\nthe United States, see Pucket v. United States, 556 U.S. l29, l37 (2oo9), by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, see McKeever v. Warden SCI-Graterford,\n486 F.3d 8l, 86 (3d Cir. 2oo7), and by this Court. See Commonwealth v. Martinez, l47\nA.3d 5l7, 53l (Pa. 2ol6).

Citing Santobello, Zuber, Commonwealth v. Hainesworth,\n82 A.3d 444 (Pa. Super. 2ol3) (en banc), and other decisions, this Court held that the\noffenders were entitled to specific performance of the terms of the plea bargains to which\nthe prosecutors had agreed. Martinez, l47 A.3d at 53l-32. We held that, once a\nbargained term is enveloped within a plea agreement, a defendant “is entitled to the\nbenefit of his bargain through specific performance of terms of the plea agreement.” /d.\nat 533.\n\nThe applicability of contract law principles to criminal negotiations is not limited to\nthe plea bargaining process. See United States v. Carrillo, 7o9 F.2d 35 (9th Cir. l983)\n(holding that fundamental fairness requires a prosecutor to uphold his or her end of a\nnon-prosecution agreement). For instance, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit has explained that, like plea agreements, non-prosecution agreements are\nbinding contracts that must be interpreted according to general principles of contract law,\nguided by “special due process concerns.” United States v. Baird, 2l8 F.3d 22l, 229 (3d\nCir. 2ooo) (citation omited). And, in Commonwealth v. Ginn, 587 A.2d 3l4 (Pa.

Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6l of 8o\n\nAn entirely different situation arises when the decision not to prosecute is\nunconditional, is presented as absolute and final, or is announced in such a way that it\ninduces the defendant to act in reliance thereupon. When a non-prosecution decision is\nconveyed in such a way, and when a defendant, having no indication to the contrary,\ndetrimentally relies upon that decision, due process may warrant preclusion of the\nprosecution. Numerous state and federal courts have found that a defendant's\ndetrimental reliance upon the government's assurances during the plea bargaining phase\nboth implicates his due process rights and entitles him to <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> even of\nunconsummated agreements. The cases are legion.*°\nae See, e.g., State v. Francis, 424 P.3d l56, l6o (Utah 2ol7) (holding that, “[W]hen a\ndefendant has reasonably and detrimentally relied on a plea agreement, the State should\nnot be able to withdraw a plea agreement just because it has not yet been presented to\nthe district court”); State v. Johnson, 36o S.W.3d lo4, ll5 (Ark. 2olo) (holding that, “when\nthe State has entered into an agreement not to prosecute with a prospective defendant\nand the defendant has performed and acted to his detriment or prejudice in reliance upon\nthat agreement, the government must be required to honor such an agreement.”); People\nv. Rhoden, 89 Cal. Rptr.2d 8l9, 824 (Cal.

Streebing, 987 F.2d 368, 372-73 (6th Cir. l993) (holding\nthat the defendant had to demonstrate, inter alia, that he had relied upon the\ngovernment’s promise to his detriment before the promise would be enforceable); United\nStates v. Savage, 978 F.2d ll36, ll38 (9th Cir. l992) (explaining that a defendant’s\ndetrimental reliance is an exception to the general rule that defendants are not entitled to\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of unconsummated plea agreements); State v. Parkey, 47l N.W.2d 896,\n898 (loua App. l99l) (finding that, in the absence of a shouing that the defendant\ndetrimentally relied upon an agreement with the prosecutor, dismissal was not\nwarranted); Roue v.

As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement. In that case, Stipetich agreed with the police that, if he revealed\nhis source for obtaining drugs, no charges would be filed against him or his wife.\nStipetich, 652 A.2d at l294-95.

This Court found that the\nnon-prosecution agreement was invalid, because the police did not have the authority to\nmake it. Only a prosecutor holds that pouer. /d.\n\nWe recognized that what befell the Stipetiches may have been “fundamentally\nunfair,” particularly if their discussions with the police produced additional evidence of\ncriminality, including possibly self-incriminating statements. /d. at l296. In dicta, we\nsuggested that the remedy might be to suppress the evidence or statements that were\nobtained after the police purported to bind the Commonwealth in a non-prosecution\nagreement. /d.\n\nThis remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\ncircumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to prosecute. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of reasonable reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\nundertaken. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\ncircumstances of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> will suffice.\n\nHere, only full <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the decision not to prosecute can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process.

At no point did the\ndefendant seek relief from the protective order. Id.

Id.\nThe district court condemned the defendant’s behavior as “entirely unnecessary and |\ninappropriate,” but nonetheless refused to sanction the defendant—apparently because, had the |\ndefendant sought relief from that order, the judge would have granted its request.

Id. at 94. |\nThere are three reasons why Chemical Bank does not justify this Court’s refusing to |\napply the Martindell factors to the Government’s application.

Second, while a reader |\nof Chemical Bank cannot be certain whether the district court complied with Martindell, the |\n|\nlanguage quoted above certainly suggests that the district court engaged in the balancing exercise |\nthat Martindell contemplated. Finally, nothing in the record suggests that the Government’s |\ninvestigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I will return later |\nin this opinion. |\nThe Court will, therefore, analyze the Government’s request in light of the Martindell |\nfactors. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo886 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4936 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004940.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l7 of 27\n.

If Any Party Relied on the Protective Order To Shield Confidential |\nMaterials from Disclosure to Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>, That Reliance Was\nUnreasonable |\nUnder Martindell, a court must consider the degree to which the party opposing unsealing |\n(or, in this case, the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on the |\nprotective order. “Once a confidentiality order has been entered and relied upon, it can only be |\nmodified if an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested |\nmodification.” F.D.LC. v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 23o, 232 (2d Cir. l982) (emphasis added) |\n(internal quotation omited). |\nI will assume, for purposes of argument, that Maxwell would oppose releasing Boies |\nSchiller from the terms of the Protective Order in order to accommodate the grand jury |\nsubpoena; that is fairly obvious from her refusal to agree to a protective order that would have |\npermited Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing |\ncompliance. I further assume she would argue that she relied on the Protective Order in deciding |\nwhether and hou to comply with various discovery requests. The question to be decided is |\nwhether such reliance was reasonable. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494o |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the Protective Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\ndestruction of documents upon conclusion of the case (see Protective Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the Protective Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 27\n\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThis decision accords with those of other courts in this Circuit. “Where a protective |\norder contains express language that limits the time period for <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, anticipates the |\npotential for modification, or contains specific procedures for disclosing confidential materials to |\nnon-parties, it is not reasonable for a party to rely on an assumption that it will never be |\nmodified.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32o.

No confidential\ninformation was disclosed.2 Ms. Maxwell’s trial lawyers made the very same argument\nin a public pleading that was quoted by the press. (Dkt. No. 3lo). In that public\npleading, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers argue:\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was\n\nenforceable and that DA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later\n\non the same charges violated his Due Process rights. (Id. at 78-79). As a\n\nresult, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (Id. at 79). In so holding,\n\nthe Court noted the follouing:\n\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant,\nincluding circumstances where the later seeks <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of some\npromise or assurance made by the former, are not immune from the\ndictates of due process and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

There is no plausible claim that inspection of the original photographs is\nwarranted, and to the extent that Maxwell seeks the photographs in order to disprove their\nauthenticity (and challenge any potential testimony that might be advanced at trial), the request is\nentirely speculative. Even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish relevance, the\nargument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s testimony or\nwhether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nFinally, the request for materials related to the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund is\ndenied for substantially the same reasons the Court articulated in its April 27, 2o2l Opinion. See\nDkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 6-8. Here, too, Maxwell has failed to establish the\nmaterials’ relevance. The briefing makes clear that Maxwell seeks these documents for mere\nimpeachment purposes, which again does not warrant issuance or <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena. Furthermore, to the extent that Maxwell hinges her theory of relevance on the\npossibility that these documents may contain some exculpatory evidence, the request is entirely\nspeculative. The “mere hope” that documents might produce some degree of exculpatory\nevidence is also insufficient. See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-579 (SWK), l984 WL 845,\nat *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell has proffered no plausible basis why these materials\nmight be exculpatory beyond her theory that they will help her undermine the potential witness’s\ncredibility.\n\nIn sum, for the reasons stated by the Court in its April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l orders,\nthe request for authorization of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-l is DENIED.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o34", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 335 Filed o9/o3/2l Page2of3\nmust balance the risk of surprise to the defendant, which is enhanced if ‘there are a large number\nof co-conspirators and a long-running conspiracy’ with legitimate law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> concerns,\nsuch as the potential danger to co-conspirators and the risk of compromising continuing\ninvestigations.’” United States v.

No. 34.7\n\nIndeed, in two recent highly publicized cases in the Eastern District of New York, the\ndistrict court judges permited victims to testify using pseudonyms or using only their first\nnames. In United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (E.D.N.Y.), the Government moved to allou\ntestifying victims to testify “under a nickname, first name, or pseudonym only, and to not be\nrequired to disclose uniquely identifying information,” such as “addresses, names of family\nmembers, or exact places of education or employment.” Order at 29, 32, Raniere, No. l8 Cr.\n2o4 (E.D.N.Y. May 6, 2ol9), Dkt. No. 622. The Court granted the motion, explaining that\n“requiring victims of sex trafficking . . . and other crimes to provide their names in public could\nchill their willingness to testify,” and “would only cause further embarrassment and humiliation,\ngiven the inflammatory nature of the conduct alleged.” Jd. at 32, 35 (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited). It also may “cause other victims to fear seeking help from law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> as that could subject them to further harassment and embarrassment.” /d. (citation\nand internal quotation marks omited). Although the defendant claimed that several victims’\n2 Sex abuse cases are not unique. In other contexts, courts have permited the Government to\ncall witnesses using pseudonyms or using their first names only, notwithstanding a defendant’s\nSixth Amendment rights. See, e.g., United States v. Schulte, 436 F. Supp. 3d 698, 7o6 (S.D.N.Y.\n2o2o) (permiting use of pseudonyms in national security case); United States v.

Publicizing their names will subject them to unwanted atention at the time they\nare testifying in a criminal sex abuse trial.‘\n\nTaken together, requiring the Minor Victims to testify under their true and full names\nimposes serious costs on them. It is inconsistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act’s\nexhortation that victims are to be treated with respect for their “dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(8). And requiring victims of sex crimes to provide their names in public could chill\ntheir willingness to testify, for fear of having their personal histories publicized as they rebuild\ntheir lives. See Order at 2, Martinez, No. l7 Cr. 28l (ERK) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol7), Dkt. No.\n34.

Cf Fed. R.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 54\nDep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No 293 Ex. A). Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant investigative steps were completed, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant. To evaluate the evidence, jurors\nwould also need to understand the sequencing of the various investigations into Epstein and the\ndefendant, so they could understand which witnesses and evidence were available to which law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies and prosecutors at what times. The history of various investigations into\nEpstein reaches back 2o years, and a review of that history would create an extensive sideshou.\nAny marginal probative value of evidence of the Government’s charging decisions is\nsubstantially outweighed by the extended digression and confusion that such evidence would\nrequire.\n\nThird, eliciting information about past charging decisions would be hearsay. See White,\n692 F.3d at 244-45 (declining to decide whether the evidence in that case was hearsay); id. at\n253 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (“[A]s the majority opinion observes, hearsay problems abound in\nthis case; yet, since neither party raised these issues on appeal, the Court has not decided whether\nthe charging documents . . . are admissible hearsay.”). Those charging decisions were made\ninternally by prosecutors at the USAO-SDFL or at this Office. No prosecutors from either office\nare testifying at trial, and no witness testifying at this trial can explain the Government’s past\ncharging decisions. Any knouledge that an FBI agent has, or that a witness has, about the basis\nfor a prior charging decision is based on statements made by prosecutors, which are themselves\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive.

It is irrelevant what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so. It is the defense’s plan to introduce information about the internal case opening\nand charging decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office, a summary of media coverage, and a\nhost of other irrelevant topics.'* The circus this would create at trial vastly outweighs any\n'3 Tn any event, if any investigation can be atacked, it is only the New York investigation. The\nNew York investigation led to the charging decision in this case, and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers\nfrom Florida are being called as limited fact witnesses. The Government does not expect to elicit\nthe NPA except perhaps to draw the sting if the Court permits cross-examination on the subject.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5586", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005691.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page4ofl4\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully moves in limine, pursuant to United States v.

Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry. The government has not established, and will not be able to establish at trial, a\nsufficient factual predicate of flight from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt under\ncontrolling precedent. See Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424-25.

While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d.

The reason is simple —\n\nthose inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell never once left\n\nthe country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was\nplanning to flee, despite having received a grand jury subpoena and knouing that she was\nconsidered a subject of the ongoing FBI investigation. Instead, she found a permanent residence\nclose to New York where she stayed continuously for seven months before her arrest and\nremained in regular contact with the prosecutors through her atorneys.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this phenomenon has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 393 Filed lo/29/2l Page5oflo\n\nAt the same time, three of the government’s other witnesses\nRn) 2o° law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers. Because the government\nfrequently atempts to elicit expert opinion testimony from law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers without\ndisclosing them as experts under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 or qualifying them as\nexperts under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2, and because law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witnesses often offer\nopinion testimony about the defendant’s mental state and vouch for the truthfulness or bolster the\ncredibility of alleged victims in contravention of Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4, this Court should\ngrant this motion in /imine.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs expert opinion testimony at trial. It says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nIf a law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officer gives testimony that “depend|[s], in whole or in part, on his\nspecialized training and experience,” the testimony is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule\n7o2 and not lay opinion testimony subject to Rule 7ol. United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol,\n2l6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We hold that the foundation requirements of Rule 7ol do not permit a law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agent to testify to an opinion . . . if the agent’s reasoning process depended, in\nwhole or in part, on his specialized training and experience.”).\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 393 Filed lo/29/2l Page6oflo\n\nIn turn, if a prosecution witness offers expert opinion testimony under Rule 7o2, Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure l6(l)(G) requires the government to make significant and\nsubstantive pretrial disclosures. The government must disclose “a writen summary of any\ntestimony that the government intends to use . . . during its case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(l)(G). The summary “must [also] describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons\nfor those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Id.\n\nThe government has not endorsed yy as cxpert witnesses\nunder Rule 7o2 or made any pretrial disclosures for these witnesses under Rule l6(l)(g).\nAccordingly, none of these witnesses can offer expert opinion testimony at trial. That means\nthese witnesses should not be permited to offer testimony on any of the follouing subjects:\n\ne Any expert “overview” testimony about the case, its origins, and the investigation.\n\nE.g., United States v. Brooks, 736 F.3d 92l, 93o-3l (loth Cir. 2ol3) (overview\ntestimony can include improper expert opinion testimony).!\n\n' Overview testimony is susceptible to abuse because it strays\n\ninto maters that are reserved for the jury, such as opinions about a defendant’s guilt\n\nor a witness’s credibility. An overview witness, for example, might express\n\nopinions about the defendant’s truthfulness at certain times or [her] likelihood of\n\nbeing involved in a scheme or crime, thus usurping the jury’s role in making fact\n\nfindings based on the credibility and demeanor of witnesses with personal\n\nknouledge. Other potential problems include the government’s ability (l) to spin\n\nthe evidence in its favor before it is admited (assuming it is ever admited), (2) to\n\ngive its official imprimatur to certain evidence, and (3) to allou its witnesses\n\n(usually law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>) to testify on maters about which they have no personal\n\nknouledge or that are based on hearsay.\nBrooks, 736 F.3d at 93o.\n\n[S]uch testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be\n\ninfluenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not\n\nin evidence. There is also the possibility that later testimony might be different than\n\nwhat the overview witness assumed; objections could be sustained or the witness\n\ncould change his or her story. Overview testimony by government agents is\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5752", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 393 Filed lo/29/2l Page 7 oflo\n\ne Any testimony about the nature and structure of alleged conspiracies, or the nature\nand structure of alleged sex trafficking operations. See United States v. Daly, 842\nF.2d l38o (2d Cir. l988) (testimony about the nature and structure of organized crime\nis expert opinion testimony); see also Mejia, 545 F.3d at l89-92.\n\ne Any testimony purporting to interpret the communications of others or “codes.” See\nUnited States v. Levasseur, 8l6 F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir. l987) (testimony about the\nmeaning of messages writen in code is expert opinion testimony); United States v.\nBorrone-Iglar, 468 F.2d 4l9, 42l (2d Cir. l972) (testimony “concerning the narcotics\nvernacular used in [recorded] telephone conversations” is expert opinion testimony).\n\ne Any testimony vouching for or bolstering the credibility of witnesses. United States v.\n\nCruz, 98l F.2d 659, 662-63 (2d Cir. l992) (improper for an expert to bolster\ngovernment fact-witness’ credibility because such bolstering is irrelevant and\nprejudicial).\n\ne Any “opinion about whether [Ms. Maxwell] did or did not have a mental state or\n\ncondition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, though, any opinion\ntestimony that is based on ys specialized “training and\nexperience” is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule 7o2 and Rule l6(l)(G) and is\ninadmissible at trial. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d at 2l6.\n\nIf the testimony of the government’s law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers is not properly limited, it\nis “likely to give [their] factual testimony an ‘unmerited credibility’ before the jury.” Mejia, 545\nF.3d at l92 (2d Cir. 2oo8). See also United States v. Alvarez, 837 F.2d lo24, lo3o (llth Cir.\nl988) (“When the expert is a government law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agent testifying on behalf of the\n\nespecially problematic because juries may place greater weight on evidence\n\nperceived to have the imprimatur of the government.\n\nUnited States v.

Mejia, 545 F.3d at l92.\nTheir testimony also often relies on testimonial hearsay, depriving the defendant of her\nconstitutional right to confrontation. U.S. Const. amend. VI; see United States v. Lombardozzi,\n49l F.3d 6l, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n3 The Court should preclude expert opinion testimony not only from the law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nwitnesses the government calls in its case-in-chief, but also any law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witnesses Ms.\nMaxwell calls in her defense. Ms. Maxwell has not disclosed or endorsed these law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nofficers as expert witnesses, so the government cannot use cross-examination of these officers to\nelicit expert opinion testimony that would be inadmissible if offered on direct examination.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5754", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005756.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 393 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagelooflo\nCertificate of Service\nI hereby certify that on October l8, 2o2l, I electronically filed the foregoing Ghislaine\n\nMaxwell’s Motion to Preclude Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Witnesses from Offering Expert Opinion\nTestimony with the Clerk of Court using the CM/ECF system which will send notification of\nsuch filing to all counsel of record.\n\nAlison Moe\n\nMaurene Comey\n\nAndrew Rohrbach\n\nLara Pomerantz\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office, SDNY\n\nOne Saint Andrew’s Plaza\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nAlison.moe@usdoj.gov\n\nMaurene.comey@usdoj.gov\n\nAndrew.Rohrbach@usdoj.gov\n\nLara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\n\ns/ Nicole Simmons\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5756", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4of9\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves in limine to preclude reference to the accusers as “victims” or\n“minor victims.” Ms. Maxwell moves for an order precluding all trial participants from referring\nto the accusers as “victims” or “minor victims.” Instead, all trial participants, including the\nCourt, should refer to all persons by their individual names.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nUnder the United States Constitution, Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent unless the\ngovernment proves all elements of the alleged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. U.S. Const.\namend. V; Jn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). The presumption of innocence has deep\nhistorical roots and is a core tenet of criminal law. “The principle that there is a presumption of\ninnocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.” Coffin v. United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of innocence).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., Jackson v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a rape\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of84\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s\nthirteen motions in limine, dated October l8, 2o2l. For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue. (See Def. Mots. 5, 6, lo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5787", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005865.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 82 of 84\nevidence—including evidence of rape, where it occurs—is the core conduct in the case. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG), 2o2o WL 77736o6, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o,\n2o2o) (describing evidence of rape in a trial for sex trafficking of minors); United States v.\nGraham, No. l4 Cr. 5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o, 2ol5) (concluding,\nin response to the argument that “rape” is a legal term, “there is a “critical distinction between a\npatient telling a physician that she ‘had intercourse with three men’ and a patient telling the\nphysician that she was ‘raped’ by three men.”’). Its probative value is certainly not outweighed by\nany unfair prejudice. Nor is it the case that evidence of a rape—especially at the level of\nabstraction described by the defense—is significantly more inflammatory than the charged crime:\nthe sexual abuse of minors.\n\nIn the event that a Minor Victim testifies that Epstein raped them, it is part of the charged\nconspiracy in this case, and it should be admited.\n\nVIII. The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does\nNot Plan to Elicit\n\nThree of the defense motions are aimed at precluding the Government from offering\nevidence it does not intend to offer at trial.\n\nFirst, the defense seeks to preclude the Government from arguing that the defendant was\nhiding from, evading, or fleeing from law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> between Epstein’s arrest and her oun.\n(Def. Mot. 5 at l). The Government’s view remains that such conduct reflects the defendant’s\nconsciousness of her guilt (see id. at 2 (citing multiple Government filings)), and the Government\ndoes not agree that such evidence lacks an adequate factual basis or is inadmissible under Rule\n4o3. (See id. at 6-9). Houever, the Government does not intend—and so will agree not to offer—\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5865", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 83 of 84\nsuch evidence in its case-in-chief, unless the defendant opens the door to this evidence or otherwise\nputs it at issue at trial. Furthermore, if the defendant testifies, the Government may cross-examine\nthe defendant about this conduct, depending on the scope of her direct examination. But the\nGovernment will not affirmatively offer this evidence in its case-in-chief.\n\nThe same is true for the defense motion to exclude evidence of the defendant’s false\nstatements in her 2ol6 depositions. (Def. Mot. 6 at l). Although false exculpatory statements are\nadmissible as proof of a defendant’s consciousness of guilt (see Gov’t Opp. at l42-43, Dkt. No.\n2o4 (citing, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4)), the Government does\nnot intend—and so will agree—not to offer this information as part of its case-in-chief, unless the\ndefense opens the door or otherwise puts these statements at issue. Houever, the Government may\noffer these statements in rebutal to defense arguments. Moreover, the defendant’s prior statements\nare of course appropriate material for cross-examination of the defendant. The Government also\nconsents to the defense request to redact the perjury counts from the Indictment. (Def. Mot. 6 at\n6).\n\nFinally, the defense seeks to preclude the Government’s law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witnesses from\noffering expert testimony. (Def. Mot. lo at 5). The defense appears to take an improperly broad\nview of the scope of expert testimony.**> Houever, the Government has not noticed the three law\n°3 For instance, the defense, citing United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol (2d Cir. 2oo5), makes\nthe sweeping claim that “any opinion testimony” based on those three law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witnesses’\n“specialized ‘training and experience’ is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule 7o2 and Rule\nl6(l)(G) and is inadmissible at trial.” (Def. Mot. lo at 4 (emphasis in original)). But in Garcia,\nthe Second Circuit simply held that an undercover law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agent could not testify as lay\nopinion that, based on his knouledge from other drug interdiction cases, the defendant was a\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5866", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 84 of 84\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers identified by the defense as experts and will not elicit expert testimony from\nthem. Those witnesses are being called as fact witnesses to describe, for instance, the execution\nof a search and evidence seized during that search.”4\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government respectfully requests that the Court deny the\ndefendant’s motions in limine.\nDated: October 25, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\n\nUnited States Atorney for the\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nBy: /s/\n\nAlison Moe\n\nLara Pomerantz\n\nAndrew Rohrbach\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\npartner in the narcotics distribution conspiracy. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d at 2l6. That is distinguishable\nfrom cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in\ncertain investigative steps.\n4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case\nagents (Def. Mot. lo at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”\n(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lol\n\nThe determination that a report of sexual assault is false can be\n\nmade only if the evidence establishes that no crime was commited or\n\natempted. This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false.

They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006300.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3of:\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force.

No. 34.7\n\nIndeed, in two recent highly publicized cases in the Eastern District of New York, the\ndistrict court judges permited victims to testify using pseudonyms or using only their first\nnames. In United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (E.D.N.Y.), the Government moved to allou\ntestifying victims to testify “under a nickname, first name, or pseudonym only, and to not be\nrequired to disclose uniquely identifying information,” such as “addresses, names of family\nmembers, or exact places of education or employment.” Order at 29, 32, Raniere, No. l8 Cr.\n2o4 (E.D.N.Y.

Publicizing their names will subject them to unwanted atention at the time they\nare testifying in a criminal sex abuse trial.‘\n\nTaken together, requiring the Minor Victims to testify under their true and full names\nimposes serious costs on them. It is inconsistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act’s\nexhortation that victims are to be treated with respect for their “dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(8). And requiring victims of sex crimes to provide their names in public could chill\ntheir willingness to testify, for fear of having their personal histories publicized as they rebuild\ntheir lives.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 54\nDep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No 293 Ex. A). Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant investigative steps were completed, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant. To evaluate the evidence, jurors\nwould also need to understand the sequencing of the various investigations into Epstein and the\ndefendant, so they could understand which witnesses and evidence were available to which law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies and prosecutors at what times. The history of various investigations into\nEpstein reaches back 2o years, and a review of that history would create an extensive sideshou.\nAny marginal probative value of evidence of the Government’s charging decisions is\nsubstantially outweighed by the extended digression and confusion that such evidence would\nrequire.\n\nThird, eliciting information about past charging decisions would be hearsay. See White,\n692 F.3d at 244-45 (declining to decide whether the evidence in that case was hearsay); id. at\n253 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (“[A]s the majority opinion observes, hearsay problems abound in\nthis case; yet, since neither party raised these issues on appeal, the Court has not decided whether\nthe charging documents . . . are admissible hearsay.”). Those charging decisions were made\ninternally by prosecutors at the USAO-SDFL or at this Office. No prosecutors from either office\nare testifying at trial, and no witness testifying at this trial can explain the Government’s past\ncharging decisions. Any knouledge that an FBI agent has, or that a witness has, about the basis\nfor a prior charging decision is based on statements made by prosecutors, which are themselves\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest.

Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is irrelevant what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so. It is the defense’s plan to introduce information about the internal case opening\nand charging decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office, a summary of media coverage, and a\nhost of other irrelevant topics.'* The circus this would create at trial vastly outweighs any\n'3 Tn any event, if any investigation can be atacked, it is only the New York investigation. The\nNew York investigation led to the charging decision in this case, and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers\nfrom Florida are being called as limited fact witnesses. The Government does not expect to elicit\nthe NPA except perhaps to draw the sting if the Court permits cross-examination on the subject.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6545", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6548", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 448 Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloflo\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n-------- +--+ +--+ +--+ FX\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n- : 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL,\nDefendant.\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL’S MOTION TO PRECLUDE LAW <span class=\"highlight\">ENFORCEMENT</span>\nWITNESSES FROM OFFERING EXPERT OPINION TESTIMONY\nJeffrey S.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this phenomenon has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6687", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 448 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5oflo\n\nAt the same time, three of the government’s other witnesses\nRn) 2o° law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers. Because the government\nfrequently atempts to elicit expert opinion testimony from law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers without\ndisclosing them as experts under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 or qualifying them as\nexperts under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2, and because law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witnesses often offer\nopinion testimony about the defendant’s mental state and vouch for the truthfulness or bolster the\ncredibility of alleged victims in contravention of Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4, this Court should\ngrant this motion in /imine.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs expert opinion testimony at trial. It says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nIf a law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officer gives testimony that “depend|[s], in whole or in part, on his\nspecialized training and experience,” the testimony is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule\n7o2 and not lay opinion testimony subject to Rule 7ol. United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol,\n2l6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We hold that the foundation requirements of Rule 7ol do not permit a law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agent to testify to an opinion . . . if the agent’s reasoning process depended, in\nwhole or in part, on his specialized training and experience.”).\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6688", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 448 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6oflo\n\nIn turn, if a prosecution witness offers expert opinion testimony under Rule 7o2, Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure l6(l)(G) requires the government to make significant and\nsubstantive pretrial disclosures. The government must disclose “a writen summary of any\ntestimony that the government intends to use . . . during its case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(l)(G). The summary “must [also] describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons\nfor those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Id.\n\nThe government has not endorsed yy as cxpert witnesses\nunder Rule 7o2 or made any pretrial disclosures for these witnesses under Rule l6(l)(g).\nAccordingly, none of these witnesses can offer expert opinion testimony at trial. That means\nthese witnesses should not be permited to offer testimony on any of the follouing subjects:\n\ne Any expert “overview” testimony about the case, its origins, and the investigation.\n\nE.g., United States v. Brooks, 736 F.3d 92l, 93o-3l (loth Cir. 2ol3) (overview\ntestimony can include improper expert opinion testimony).'\n\n' Overview testimony is susceptible to abuse because it strays\n\ninto maters that are reserved for the jury, such as opinions about a defendant’s guilt\n\nor a witness’s credibility. An overview witness, for example, might express\n\nopinions about the defendant’s truthfulness at certain times or [her] likelihood of\n\nbeing involved in a scheme or crime, thus usurping the jury’s role in making fact\n\nfindings based on the credibility and demeanor of witnesses with personal\n\nknouledge. Other potential problems include the government’s ability (l) to spin\n\nthe evidence in its favor before it is admited (assuming it is ever admited), (2) to\n\ngive its official imprimatur to certain evidence, and (3) to allou its witnesses\n\n(usually law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>) to testify on maters about which they have no personal\n\nknouledge or that are based on hearsay.\nBrooks, 736 F.3d at 93o.\n\n[S]uch testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be\n\ninfluenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not\n\nin evidence. There is also the possibility that later testimony might be different than\n\nwhat the overview witness assumed; objections could be sustained or the witness\n\ncould change his or her story. Overview testimony by government agents is\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6689", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006690.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 448 Filed ll/l2/2l Page /7oflo\n\ne Any testimony about the nature and structure of alleged conspiracies, or the nature\nand structure of alleged sex trafficking operations. See United States v. Daly, 842\nF.2d l38o (2d Cir. l988) (testimony about the nature and structure of organized crime\nis expert opinion testimony); see also Mejia, 545 F.3d at l89-92.\n\ne Any testimony purporting to interpret the communications of others or “codes.” See\nUnited States v. Levasseur, 8l6 F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir. l987) (testimony about the\nmeaning of messages writen in code is expert opinion testimony); United States v.\nBorrone-Iglar, 468 F.2d 4l9, 42l (2d Cir. l972) (testimony “concerning the narcotics\nvernacular used in [recorded] telephone conversations” is expert opinion testimony).\n\ne Any testimony vouching for or bolstering the credibility of witnesses. United States v.\n\nCruz, 98l F.2d 659, 662-63 (2d Cir. l992) (improper for an expert to bolster\ngovernment fact-witness’ credibility because such bolstering is irrelevant and\nprejudicial).\n\ne Any “opinion about whether [Ms. Maxwell] did or did not have a mental state or\n\ncondition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense. Those\nmaters are for the trier of fact alone.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o4(b); see United States v.\nHaynes, 729 F.3d l78, l96 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“Testimony regarding whether the\ndefendant ‘realized’ that there were drugs in the car was erroneously admited\nbecause it is expert testimony about the defendant’s state of mind.”’).\n\nThe above list is merely an example of the types of expert opinions law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nofficers often try to offer at trial. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, though, any opinion\ntestimony that is based on ys specialized “training and\nexperience” is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule 7o2 and Rule l6(l)(G) and is\ninadmissible at trial. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d at 2l6.\n\nIf the testimony of the government’s law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers is not properly limited, it\nis “likely to give [their] factual testimony an ‘unmerited credibility’ before the jury.” Mejia, 545\nF.3d at l92 (2d Cir. 2oo8). See also United States v. Alvarez, 837 F.2d lo24, lo3o (llth Cir.\nl988) (“When the expert is a government law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agent testifying on behalf of the\n\nespecially problematic because juries may place greater weight on evidence\n\nperceived to have the imprimatur of the government.\n\nUnited States v.

Mejia, 545 F.3d at l92.\nTheir testimony also often relies on testimonial hearsay, depriving the defendant of her\nconstitutional right to confrontation. U.S. Const. amend. VI; see United States v. Lombardozzi,\n49l F.3d 6l, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n3 The Court should preclude expert opinion testimony not only from the law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nwitnesses the government calls in its case-in-chief, but also any law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witnesses Ms.\nMaxwell calls in her defense. Ms. Maxwell has not disclosed or endorsed these law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nofficers as expert witnesses, so the government cannot use cross-examination of these officers to\nelicit expert opinion testimony that would be inadmissible if offered on direct examination.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo669l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 448 Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloof lo\nCertificate of Service\nI hereby certify that on October l8, 2o2l, I electronically filed the foregoing Ghislaine\n\nMaxwell’s Motion to Preclude Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Witnesses from Offering Expert Opinion\nTestimony with the Clerk of Court using the CM/ECF system which will send notification of\nsuch filing to all counsel of record.\n\nAlison Moe\n\nMaurene Comey\n\nAndrew Rohrbach\n\nLara Pomerantz\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office, SDNY\n\nOne Saint Andrew’s Plaza\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nAlison.moe@usdoj.gov\n\nMaurene.comey@usdoj.gov\n\nAndrew.Rohrbach@usdoj.gov\n\nLara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\n\ns/ Nicole Simmons\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6693", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page4of84\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s\nthirteen motions in limine, dated October l8, 2o2l.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue.

The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does\nNot Plan to Elicit\n\nThree of the defense motions are aimed at precluding the Government from offering\nevidence it does not intend to offer at trial.\n\nFirst, the defense seeks to preclude the Government from arguing that the defendant was\nhiding from, evading, or fleeing from law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> between Epstein’s arrest and her oun.\n(Def.

Furthermore, if the defendant testifies, the Government may cross-examine\nthe defendant about this conduct, depending on the scope of her direct examination. But the\nGovernment will not affirmatively offer this evidence in its case-in-chief.\n\nThe same is true for the defense motion to exclude evidence of the defendant’s false\nstatements in her 2ol6 depositions. (Def. Mot. 6 at l). Although false exculpatory statements are\nadmissible as proof of a defendant’s consciousness of guilt (see Gov’t Opp. at l42-43, Dkt. No.\n2o4 (citing, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4)), the Government does\nnot intend—and so will agree—not to offer this information as part of its case-in-chief, unless the\ndefense opens the door or otherwise puts these statements at issue. Houever, the Government may\noffer these statements in rebutal to defense arguments. Moreover, the defendant’s prior statements\nare of course appropriate material for cross-examination of the defendant. The Government also\nconsents to the defense request to redact the perjury counts from the Indictment. (Def. Mot. 6 at\n6).\n\nFinally, the defense seeks to preclude the Government’s law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witnesses from\noffering expert testimony. (Def. Mot. lo at 5).

That is distinguishable\nfrom cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in\ncertain investigative steps.\n4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case\nagents (Def. Mot. lo at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”\n(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony. The Government has moved to\npreclude the defense from offering such evidence, including by calling the case agents identified\nin its Touhy notice. (See Gov’t Motions in Limine Section III). Accordingly, if the defense plans\nto call case agents for such testimony—which the Court should preclude—the defense must\nprovide expert notice of such testimony.\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6792", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006815.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force.

In a case analogous to this one on this issue,\n\n8 United States v. Borrero, another district court judge held\n\n9 that a defendant could permissibly cross-examine a witness\n\nlo about their prior statement to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> in which they\n\nll accused a different individual of the crime for which the\n\nl2 defendant was later charged. 2ol3 WL 6o2o773 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\nl3 That case docket is l3 CR 58. But the court there did not\n\nl4 admit the charging decision that the early investigation had\n\nl5 ended in a nolle, because it would confuse jurors, require\n\nl6 extended factual disputes, and was, at best, cumulative of the\nl7 witness's statement. As I have explained, the same would\n\nl8 appear to be true here.\n\nl9 Fifth piece of guidance: In contrast to what I\n2o indicated may not come in, the Court will permit relevant\n2l cross—-examination of the government's witnesses. Defense seeks\n22 to imoeach the credibility of some witnesses by admiting those\n23 witnesses' prior statements to the government that purportedly\n24 did not implicate Ms. Maxwell.

Evidence along those lines, if proffered in an\nl7 opening statement, or if asked about in cross-examination of a\nl8 law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officer, would be inappropriate and hearsay.\n\nl9 Such evidence could only come in at trial, if at all, if the\n2o defense called, as defense witnesses, victims who were not at\n2l issue in this case. And so, for that reason, your Honor, the\n22 defense should be precluded from opening on this issue unless\n23 and until they proffer which victims these statements would\n24 come through, who they would anticipate calling as defense\n25 witnesses at trial so the Court can assess whether that is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o82", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007085.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page 34 of l27 34\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl Houever, even if this became an issue at the trial, the remedy\n2 would be to permit the defense to call these relevant witnesses\n3 to talk about whether the defendant was or was not involved in\n4 their sex trafficking. The remedy would not be to permit\n\n5 defense from cross-examining law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents about\n\n6 hearsay statements that other individuals provided to them.

The Administrator may also request a meeting\nwith a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location,\nthough the Claimant is not obligated to atend any such meeting.\n3. Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4, Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s determination, the Administrator's receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant.

Confidentiality/Privacy\nThe Program is confidential.’ By filing a claim with the Program, the Claimant or her Legal\nRepresentative (where applicable) agrees that information submited by the Claimant pursuant to\nthe Program will be used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her designees only for the\nfollouing purposes:\nl) Processing and evaluating the Claimant’s claim;\n2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and\n3) Reports to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent claims.\nWhen documents or other information maintained or submited by the Estate become part of a\nClaimant’s file for purposes of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to\nassist in processing and evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain confidential. No information\nprovided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant’s name and the date(s)\nand location(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and,\nfor purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant\nalleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained\nsolely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any\nclaim, regardless of forum.

Although generally “production of impeaching evidence pursuant to Rule l7(c) is not required\nuntil after the witness testifies,” Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2, in this case the Government\nexpects each of the Minor Victims named in the subpoena to testify at trial. Accordingly, if the\nCourt permits <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the subpoena, the Government does not object to production of the\nrecords to the Court before the Minor Victims actually testify for the sake of efficiency.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page4of8\nPage 4\n\nC. Any and All Material Submited to the EVCP\n\nThe defendant makes a further request for any and all submissions by the Minor Victims\nto the EVCP. This request would not generate relevant, admissible evidence for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the defendant has not identified a theory by which these materials are relevant and\nadmissible. The defendant argues primarily that the materials contain relevant impeachment\ninformation because “[f]ull and complete cross-examination is impossible without understanding\nthe complete terms of the agreement with the Epstein Fund, including the claims concerning\nMaxwell, as well as others.” (Def. Mot. at 6). Materials are not relevant and admissible at trial,\nas required by Nixon, simply because they aid the defendant’s “understanding.” And the defendant\narticulates only one theory by which EVCP materials may be admited to shou bias. According\nto the defendant, the May 2o2o Protocol governing the EVCP states that claims are evaluated\ndepending on whether “there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the\nappropriate . .. United States Atorneys’ Office or other law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency.” (Def. Mot. at\n5). If this “prosecution against [the defendant] went forward,” the argument goes, the Minor\nVictims and their lawyers would “benefit.” (d.)\n\nThe defendant already has the information relevant to this argument. She has the protocol\nfor the EVCP. The Government has “offered” no “information” or “findings” to the EVCP about\nthe Minor Victims; to the extent the EVCP relied on publicly available information about this case\nto make its determination, such as the charging instruments in this case, that information is in the\npublic record. And the Government has already disclosed to the defendant the setlement\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7396", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 49l Filed ll/22/2l Page4of6\ndefendant at the time.

The book is sewn, bound, and contains an extensive set of private information. The\ndefense offers no theory for hou Mr. Rodriguez could have generated that information and bound\nit together seamlessly in an address book that could fool Employee-l. Further, if the address book\nwere a forgery, it would have provided Mr. Rodriguez with a complete defense in his criminal\ncase: the defendant could not have impaired a grand jury investigation by “concealing” a forged\ndocument. See l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(c). Instead, Mr. Rodriguez was sentenced to eighteen months in\nprison.\n\nNor is there reason to believe that the book was altered in any significant way by Mr.\nRodriguez. As the Court can see from the pages the Government has marked separately (see GX\n52-A through G2-H), any handwriting is minimal and non-substantive, at least on the pages the\nGovernment intends to emphasize at trial. The “added tabs” the defendant mentions are literally\nsticky notes atached to certain pages, likely added by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> after they seized the book\nfrom Mr. Rodriguez. And the “additional handwriten pages” to which the defendant refers are\nMr. Rodriguez’s separate notes that are not part of Government Exhibit 52.

Dr. Hall’s “fact testimony.”\n\nAs Dr. Hall’s report makes clear,\ni —CsisSCSCi‘CSCies\nMEE 2cver disclosed any abuse by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Then, when interviewed for\n6 4 hours by Dr. Hall, go claimed to have been abused by Mr. Epstein, but she did\nnot allege any abuse or improper conduct by Ms. Maxwell. This evidence is admissible as a prior\ninconsistent statement.\n\nTo the extent the government claims ggg failure ever to implicate Ms.\nMaxwell to gg or Dr. Hall is not “inconsistent enough,” that argument goes to weight,\nnot admissibility. See R.B. Ventures, Ltd. v. Shane, No. 9l CIV. 5678 (CSH), 2ooo WL 52o6l5,\nat *5 (S.D.N.Y. May l, 2ooo) (extent of inconsistency “may prove useful grist for the cross-\nexaminer’s mill,” but the argument “go[es] to the weight of this opinion testimony and not its\nadmissibility”).\n\nIndeed, this Court has already ruled that Ms. Maxwell can admit evidence that yg\nBEE rior statements to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> did not implicate Ms. Maxwell. TR ll/l/2o2l, p\n27. The same logic applies here.\n\nThe government says Ms. Maxwell “does not need Dr. Hall’s testimony to inform the\njury that bas not always disclosed the defendant’s role in Epstein’s abuse.” Mot.\nat l8. “Need,” of course, is not the test for admissibility, and the government does not get to limit\nMs. Maxwell’s evidence only that which the government claims she “needs.” See White, 692\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008120.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o9-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 9oflo\n\nFirst, the defendant tries to sneak in a claim that Minor Victim-4’s trial testimony will be\ninconsistent with her statements to ee\nBE Op». l6). Whether or not that is so remains to be seen, but either way it has nothing to\ndo with Dr. Hall. Ifthe witness said things to | | that satisfy all the prerequisites for\nadmiting extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements, then perhaps a could testify\nabout those statements. Unless, houever, Dr. Hall was in the room during therapy\nsessions, it remains hearsay as to him.\n\nSecond, the Court’s ruling that Minor Victim-4 can be cross-examined on her prior\ninconsistent statements to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> (see Opp. l6) does not help the defendant. What the\nCourt ruled was that the witness could be impeached on the grounds that she “changed her story\nto law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> . . . [p]rovided that the rules for admiting prior inconsistent statements are\nsatisfied.” (ll/l/2o2l Tr. at 27-28). The Government agrees—such testimony is admissible\n“provided that the rules for admiting prior inconsistent statements are satisfied.” And the\nGovernment has already shoun that Minor Victim-4 has not “changed her story” relative to her\ninterview with Dr. Hall, because there is no reason that story would have included the\ndefendant’s crimes. (Mot. l7-l8). Because the defendant offers no contrary argument, she\ncannot rely on this basis to call Dr. Hall.\n\nThird, the defendant claims that she does not have to make such a shouing of\ninconsistency in order to admit a prior inconsistent statement. (Opp. l6). That is obvious legal\nerror. As the Second Circuit has quite emphatically explained, although two statements do not\nhave to be directly contrary to be inconsistent, the district court must find some meaningful\ninconsistency before the rule applies.

If the Defense\nanticipated calling a witness who refuses to testify, the Defense would have the same tools at its\ndisposal as does the Government to compel that witness’s atendance at trial. The Defense could\nhave, for example, subpoenaed a witness under Rule l7. If the witness resides abroad, the\nDefense could have sought a leter rogatory under 28 U.S.C. § l78l, which is a mechanism that\nthe Second Circuit has repeatedly emphasized. See, e.g., United States v. Brennerman, 8l8 F.\nApp’x 25, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2o) (citing § l78l as a mechanism for a criminal defendant to “secure\ntestimony from the United Kingdom’’); United States v. Lee, 723 F.3d l34, l42 n.6 (2d Cir.\n2ol3). These mechanisms ensure that pseudonyms are not necessary to secure a reluctant\nwitness’s testimony and the Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting pseudonyms.\n\nThird, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for a witness that works as a plain\nclothes law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officer, citing in support a large body of case law in which anonymity\nwas granted for testifying law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers. Def. Leter at 5. But as the Government\nnotes, the cases relied on by the Defense uniformly involve officers that work undercover such\nthat revealing their true name to the public would subject them to violent retaliation by the\ndefendant or other individuals, or would frustrate their ability to remain undercover. E.g., United\nStates v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8); United States v. Hernandez, No. Sl\nl2 CR 8o9 PKC, 2ol3 WL 3936l85 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2ol3).

This prejudice would\nlo substantially outweigh any minimum probative value that might\nll be gained from such a far-flung endeavor.\n\nl2 Third, as to prejudice, the evidence would be\n\nl3 cumulative, demonstrating that an investigation was \"hasty\" and\nl4 not thorough is at best repetitive of the defense's arguments\nl5 that the government collected insufficient evidence of guilt.\nl6 That point is made most clearly and directly by focusing on the\nl7 evidence or lack of evidence and credibility or lack of\n\nl8 credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.\n\nl9 The second piece of guidance I can provide nou is that\n2o the Court will exclude much of the evidence outlined in the\nal defense's papers of the government's alleged motives for\n22 investigating and charging Ms. Maxwell.

In a case analogous to this one on this issue,\n\n8 United States v. Borrero, another district court judge held\n\n9 that a defendant could permissibly cross-examine a witness\n\nlo about their prior statement to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> in which they\n\nll accused a different individual of the crime for which the\n\nl2 defendant was later charged. 2ol3 WL 6o2o773 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\nl3 That case docket is l3 CR 58.

As I have explained, the same would\n\nl8 appear to be true here.\n\nl9 Fifth piece of guidance: In contrast to what I\n2o indicated may not come in, the Court will permit relevant\n2l cross—-examination of the government's witnesses. Defense seeks\n22 to imoeach the credibility of some witnesses by admiting those\n23 witnesses' prior statements to the government that purportedly\n24 did not implicate Ms. Maxwell.

Admiting prior statements on\n\nll cross-examination may require providing the jury some\n\nl2 background information about the prior investigations so that\nl3 the prior statements are understood in the proper context and\nl4 the jury is provided necessary background to understand that\nl5 evidence.\n\nl6 (Continued on next page)\n\nl7\n\nl8\n\nl9\n2o\n2l\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l7 of 24 29\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl THE COURT: (Continuing)\n\n2 I imagine this can be done through cross—-examination\n\n3 questions if the witness has personal knouledge.

And so, for that reason, your Honor, the\n22 defense should be precluded from opening on this issue unless\n23 and until they proffer which victims these statements would\n24 come through, who they would anticipate calling as defense\n25 witnesses at trial so the Court can assess whether that is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 22 of 24 34\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl Houever, even if this became an issue at the trial, the remedy\n2 would be to permit the defense to call these relevant witnesses\n3 to talk about whether the defendant was or was not involved in\n4 their sex trafficking. The remedy would not be to permit\n\n5 defense from cross-examining law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents about\n\n6 hearsay statements that other individuals provided to them.

Factors to be considered vary and “include but are not\nlimited to ‘the danger of impairing law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy\ninterests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o-\n5l (2d Cir. l995)).\n\nThe defendant states that the Defense Motion “is a ‘judicial document’ that is subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and the common law.” (Dkt. No.\n59o, Def. Leter at 4). The Government agrees. Houever, the defendant argues that the Court\nshould order the Defense Motion and its exhibits to remain temporarily sealed until the Court rules\non her motion or until the conclusion of any hearing ordered by the Court. (/d. at 9). The defendant\ncontends that such relief is warranted because public filing of the Defense Motion will “frustrate\nthe truth-seeking process of any factual inquiry ordered by the Court.” (/d. at 3). The Government\ndisagrees.\n\nThe defendant asserts that publicly docketing the Defense Motion “will give Juror 5o an\nimproper preview of information he does not have and should never have.” (/d. at 2). That concern\nis unfounded. The Defense Motion, as a general mater, contains discussion of some of the relevant\ncase law and information about statements reportedly made by Juror 5o in the news media. There\ncan be no need to hide from public view a discussion of public materials. Moreover, the defense’s\nsuggestion that her defense briefing contains information from some significant investigation into\nJuror 5o is not accurate; the motion does not contain any significant material that is not otherwise\npublic. Finally, to the extent the defense objects to unsealing Juror 5o’s questionnaire, which is\nan exhibit to their motion, that questionnaire is a document that Juror 5o himself prepared, and\nwhich he would of course be shoun during any fact finding inquiry.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8894", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596- Filed o2/ll/22 Page2of7\n\nSecond, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene as it is unnecessary and\nunsupported by any authority or precedent. Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, houever, will be\ndocketed because the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to seal the motion. Even though\nthe motion to intervene is denied, it is a judicial document to which the presumption in favor of\npublic access applies and no interests are served by maintaining it under seal.\n\nl. Temporary sealing of documents related to the motion for a new trial\n\nThe Court first addresses the Defendant’s request that this Court seal all documents\nrelated to the motion for a new trial either until the motion is resolved or until after a hearing is\nconducted, should one be ordered. Dkt. No. 59o at l-2. The Court considers a request to seal\npursuant to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v.

The reality of an unbiased jury is a structural prerequisite for a fair trial and, particularly\nin a notorious case such as this that has atracted international atention, the appearance that a fair\nand impartial jury has decided the defendant’s fate is essential for public respect for and acceptance\nof the outcome. Imagine that a juror had failed to reveal profound bias against law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>,\nbeen permited to sit on the jury and, after an acquital, trumpeted her role in interviews with the\npress. The public would be asking what is wrong with the American trial process that could allou\nsuch a thing to happen, and the government would be investigating the juror for perjury.\n\nAccurate answers from prospective jurors about their oun experiences and atitudes are\nessential for follou-up questioning and the ultimate judgment of the parties and the court about\nwhich jurors should serve in the case at hand. In this case, Juror No. 5o gave untrue answers about\nthe fundamental issue of whether he himself had been victimized by sexual abuse and could be\nfair and impartial ina sexual abuse case.

Accordingly, resolving these issues will likely obviate the need for\nthe defense to call those law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers and significantly save the jury’s time. !\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nPrior inconsistent statements are generally admissible for impeachment purposes only, see\nFed. R. Evid. 6l3, and are inadmissible hearsay for substantive purposes unless they were made\nat “a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition.” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(A); see Santos\nv. Murdock, 243 F.3d 68l, 684 (2d Cir. 2ool). In determining whether a party may impeach a\ntestifying witness through extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement, the Court must\nconsider the follouing five factors:\n\nFirst, whether the proffered statement in fact is inconsistent with the testimony sought to\nbe impeached, i.e., whether there is any variance between the statement and the testimony that has\na reasonable bearing on credibility. United States v. Ghailani, 76l F. Supp. 2d ll4, ll7-l8\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). While “two statements... need\nnot be diametrically opposed” to be inconsistent, they must still be inconsistent. United States v.\nTrzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo24 (2d Cir. l997) (citation omited). “[I]n certain circumstances, a\nwitness’s failure to recall a prior statement regarding a subject at issue in the trial is so incredible\nthat it may be deemed inconsistent and thus subject to impeachment by extrinsic evidence.”\nUnited States v.

Four motions to quash were filed, one each by\nthe government,! the administrator of the EVCP, Accuser-2, and Witness-3. Neither Accuser-]\nnor Accuser-4 moved to quash. As explained belou, the arguments against <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of Ms.\nMaxwell’s subpoena lack merit, and this Court should deny the motions to quash.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nOn November l5, this Court issued a Rule l7(c) subpoena to the EVCP at the request of\nMs. Maxwell. The subpoena is narrou, specific, and targeted. It seeks just four categories of\n\n' There is significant doubt whether the government has standing to move to quash, cither\nin its oun capacity or on behalf of the accusers. See United States v.

Even so, because the\nadministrator of the EVCP and two of the accusers moved to quash, Ms. Maxwell will respond to\nall the arguments made in opposition to her subpoena, even the government’s.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page3of25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Mot. for Sub, Atachment A.\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a motion for issuance of the subpoena, explaining hou her subpoena\nsatisfied Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l7(c) and the standard set forth in United States v.\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. 683 (l974). Unlike Ms. Maxwell’s earlier subpoena to Boies Schiller & Flexner\n(BSF), which the Court declined to issue, Dkt. Nos. 252, 298, the Court here authorized and\nissued Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena to the EVCP, concluding (preliminarily and correctly) that it\nwas proper under Rule l7(c). See Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d at 56l (“As the Supreme Court has\nexplained, it is the responsibility of the court, not the opposing party, to ensure that a subpoena\nsecured under Rule l7(c) is for a proper purpose.” (citing United States v. Tomison, 969 F. Supp.\n587, 594 (E.D. Cal. l997))). Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena seeks production aft trial (not pretrial), and\nit also requests that before the responsive material is produced to her for inspection, this Court\nconduct an in camera review. Combined with the narrouness of her request, Ms. Maxwell has\nsuggested careful procedures to balance her need for the material and the accusers’ interests in\nconfidentiality.\n\nEveryone agrees that Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena specifically identifies the requested\nmaterial, and there is no meaningful dispute that the material she seeks is both relevant and not\notherwise procurable. (The government and Accuser-2 offer cursory arguments about relevance,\nwhich are easily dismissed.) Instead, the disagreement concerns whether the material is\nadmissible and whether <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the subpoena would be unreasonable and oppressive.\nConsidering Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to present a defense and to confront her\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll426", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pageloof 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The economic incentives here are obvious—having setled her\nclaims in 2oo9, Accuser-4 needed new, more sensational information to get more money. The\nEVCP materials thus directly contradict the “motive theory” that will be advanced by the\nprosecution at trial—that Ms. Maxwell was the procurer of underaged women for Epstein. See\nMendez v. Artuz, 3o3 F.3d 4ll, 4l4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (information relevant and “exculpatory . . .\nwhen it directly contradicts the motive theory testified to by prosecution witnesses”).\n\nAs this Court has already ruled, Witness-3 cannot be called a “victim” of the charged\nconduct because she was not a minor. Even so, this Court ruled that “some of the anticipated\ntestimony [from Witness-3] can serve as direct evidence, notwithstanding the fact that the\nalleged conduct as to [her] was not illegal for the purpose of the charges in this case.” Ms.\nMaxwell and the jury have a right to knou what Witness-3 said the EVCP about the alleged\nabuse she suffered, including hou old she claimed to be when she was abused. If Witness-3\nmisrepresented her age to the EVCP, just as the government was misled by Witness-3 into\nportraying her as a minor to the grand jury and this Court, that fact bears directly on her\ncredibility. Again, it is no coincidence that, after receiving money from the fund, Witness-3 is\nnou telling the government that if asked at trial about “specific dates when things occurred, the\nanswer might be she doesn’t knou.” See 35oo material at 35l3-o59. Only when we see hou\nWitness-3 described hou old she was to the fund will we knou the truth.\n\nIn last-ditch effort to preclude <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, the government says that Ms. Maxwell\n“already has the information relevant this argument.” Gov.

The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making\nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o. The final protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court on June 3, 2o2o.\n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative\ndesign. My staff is deeply sensitive to the unique circumstances involved and is commited to\nprocessing the victims’ claims in a prompt, fair and effective manner,” said Ms. Feldman.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page5of9\n\nAll Claim Forms must be completed to the best of a Claimant’s ability and filed no later than the Filing\nDeadline.

As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witnesses.

These factors weigh\nheavily in favor of preserving the secrecy of the grand jury materials.\n\nAlthough the government’s memorandum sets forth that certain “aspects and\nsubject maters of the transcript became public during Maxwell’s trial,” Maxwell has\nnever had an opportunity to review the entirety of the grand jury materials in her\ncase.

To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n'Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.\n\n* Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Pagellof27\nBSF\n, affirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\n\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F. Supp. 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 Filed o8/ll/25 Page3of3l\ntwo perjury counts.? It ended on December 29, 2o2l, with Maxwell’s conviction on five of the\nsix counts and her acquital on the substantive enticement count.\n\nThe evidence adduced at trial is well-summarized in Judge Nathan’s post-trial decision\ndenying Maxwell’s post-trial motions, including under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29\nfor a judgment of acquital, Dkt. 657; in the Government’s brief in Maxwell’s appeal, see United\nStates v.

Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2o24).\n\nIn brief, the Government’s evidence included the testimony of four women who\ndescribed the sexual abuse they had suffered, as girls, at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell; the\ntestimony of individuals who worked for Epstein and Maxwell; the testimony of law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officials; corroborating physical evidence, including photographs of and evidence\nrecovered from searches of Epstein’s residences, and Epstein’s and Maxwell’s black address\nbook; and other corroborating records, such as flight logs of Epstein’s private planes and FedEx\nrecords.\n\nThe trial evidence focused on six girls, including the four testifying victims, who suffered\nabusive sexual contact as a result of Maxwell’s criminal actions: Jane, Kate, Annie, Carolyn,\nVirginia, and Melissa. It established that Maxwell had been instrumental in an approximately\ndecade-long scheme with Epstein to entice, groom, transport, and traffic numerous young\nwomen and underage girls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. Maxwell helped identify\nvulnerable girls for abuse, targeting those who faced difficult family circumstances, including\n3 On April l6, 2o2l, Judge Nathan granted Maxwell’s motion to sever the perjury charges.\n\nDkt. 2o7. After Maxwell’s sentencing, the Government moved to dismiss these counts, in light\nof victims’ interests in closure and avoiding the trauma of testifying again. Judge Nathan\ngranted that motion.

The “Special Circumstances” Doctrine\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that in “special circumstances,” the disclosure of\ngrand jury materials may be appropriate even where it is not authorized by Rule 6(e). The\nSecond Circuit developed this doctrine in three cases where disclosure was sought of grand jury\nmaters claimed to be of unusual historical or public interest.

Discussion\n\nA. The Government’s Basis for Claiming “Special Circumstances”\n\nNo Rule 6(e)(3) exception authorizes the disclosure the Government proposes here: of,\nsubject to redactions, all testimony and exhibits before the two grand juries that indicted\nGhislaine Maxwell. The Government’s motion to unseal does not contend otherwise. It does not\nargue that these materials would aid federal, state, military, tribal, or foreign law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>; or\nwould be relevant to national security officials, another grand jury, or another judicial\nproceeding. Nor does the Government (or Maxwell) argue that the materials could reveal a\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l46", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel7 of 3l\nEach grand jury received evidence on a single day. On that day, it heard testimony from\none person: a law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agent who, acting as a summary witness, testified to information\nobtained in the Government’s investigation to support the charges in the proposed indictment.\nThe agent, responding to tightly structured questions from an Assistant United States Atorney\n(“AUSA”), provided highly abbreviated, hearsay accounts of the statements of select witnesses\n(e.g., the victims on whom counts in the proposed indictment were based).\"4 The agent led the\njury through a PouerPoint of exhibits (e.g., photographs and business records). At the end of the\ntestimony, the agent testified that he or she had not disclosed all that he or she knew, but had\nonly responded to the AUSA’s questions. Afterwards, each grand jury voted to return the\nproposed indictment.»\n‘4 Under federal law, “[i]t is entirely permissible for the government to use hearsay evidence in\nits presentation to the grand jury.” United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(quoting United States v. Ruggiero, 934 F.2d 44o, 447 (2d Cir. l99l)); see also United States v.\nDukagjini, 326 F.3d 45, 54 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (noting the common “grand jury practice, improper at\ntrial, of a single agent simply summarizing an investigation by others’).\n'S The first Maxwell grand jury met on June 29, 2o2o. It heard testimony from an FBI special\nagent. The agent’s testimony lasted approximately one hour and 25 minutes, spanning 74\ndouble-spaced transcript pages. Two exhibits were put before the grand jury: a PouerPoint\ncontaining slides referred to during the agent’s testimony; and the proposed indictment of\nMaxwell. The same grand jury briefly met again on July 8, 2o2o, for the purpose of returning\nthe “Sl” superseding indictment, which corrected two typographical errors in the indictment.\nCompare Dkt. l7, with Dkt. l. The grand jury did not receive additional evidence.\nThe second Maxwell grand jury met on March 29, 2o2l. It heard testimony from a New York\nPolice Department detective. The detective’s testimony lasted approximately an hour and 48\nminutes, not including a brief recess, and spanned ll7 double-spaced transcript pages. Nearly\ntwo-thirds of the testimony consisted of reading into the record the special agent’s June 29, 2o2o\ntestimony. Six exhibits were put before the grand jury: the transcript of the June 29, 2o2o grand\njury testimony; the PouerPoint put before the June 29, 2o2o grand jury; a new PouerPoint with\nfurther exhibits; the two earlier indictments of Maxwell; and the proposed “S2” superseding\nindictment.\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l49", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2o of 3l\nby State Department official Alger Hiss); see also note l2, supra (citing similar D.D.C. cases).\nNone of these cases involved the secondhand, summary-witness testimony of law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nagents. None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\nAmendment. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2l of 3l\nredactions. /d. at 492-93. And once Biaggi’s testimony had been released, the Circuit\nelaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi\nhad misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand\njury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer l7 questions. /d. at 494. In these “special\ncircumstances,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi’s false account. /d.\n\nThis Court gave careful consideration to unsealing the Maxwell grand jury materials on a\nsimilar rationale. But with the Government having nou conceded that the information it\nproposes to release is redundant of the public record—that this information was “made publicly\navailable at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly reported”—the public interest in\ntesting the Government’s bona fides does not require the extraordinary step of unsealing grand\njury records. Dkt. 8oo at 3. Without any need to review the grand jury materials, the public can\nevaluate for itself the Government’s asserted bases for making this motion.\n\nThe Court therefore denies the Government’s motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary\nto the Government’s depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a mater of significant\nhistorical or public interest. Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a mater of\nlongstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the\n2o2l Maxwell trial.\n\nB. Application of the In re Craig Factors\n\nIn cases involving grand jury testimony of significant historical or public interest, /n re\nCraig supplies a framework for evaluating whether disclosure, on balance, is warranted. It\nidentifies non-exclusive factors that may weigh against disclosure, including the interests of the\ndefendant and witnesses. Because the secondhand testimony at issue here is redundant of the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l53", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 24 of 3l\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceedings or the\nGovernment Opposes Disclosure\n\nMaxwell opposes disclosure because, among other reasons, her case remains on direct\nappeal. Dkt. 8o3 at 2 (“Because this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.”’)\n\nThis factor thus weighs against unsealing. The Court, houever, assigns limited weight to\nthis factor because Maxwell, who does not have a legal right to access the grand jury materials,\nhas not seen it. Her opposition is therefore fairly viewed as precautionary. Had Maxwell been\naware that the grand jury materials are duplicative of information in the public record, her\nposition might have been different.\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThis factor addresses the present-day significance of the grand jury materials at issue and\nwhether their disclosure would advance the public interest. This factor so decisively weighs\nagainst unsealing that it alone would require denying the Government’s motion.\n\nArguments to disclose grand jury testimony on account of historical or public interest are\n“totally appropriate” and sometimes may even be weighty. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But for\nthe reasons reviewed above, the grand jury materials here are neither of historical nor public-\ninterest importance. This evidence was put before the grand juries in June 2o2o and March\n2o2l, in a case that remains on direct appeal. Cf In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp.\n3d at 628-29 (l95o grand jury testimony regarding Julius and Ethel Rosenberg); Jn re AHA, 49\nF. Supp. at 278, 297-98 (l947-l95o grand jury testimony regarding Alger Hiss). And it is not\nof present-day public importance because it consists of summary testimony by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nagents recounting information that today is a mater of public record, on account of the month-\nlong trial on the charges returned by the grand jury. Cf In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 494 (grand jury\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l56", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 27 of 3l\nThis factor, on balance, weighs against unsealing.\n6. Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury and That of Their\nFamilies\nThis factor is aimed primarily at protecting the reputations and interests of unindicted\nindividuals, about whom unsealed grand jury testimony would reveal damaging information not\npreviously disclosed. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7. There is no such person or information\nhere. Insofar as Maxwell was the subject of the grand jury testimony, this factor suggests\nconsidering here “the continued existence and vulnerability” of her and her family. Jd. Maxwell\nis alive and so theoretically could be harmed by the disclosure of adverse testimony. But here,\nthe grand jury materials, being cumulative of the public trial evidence, do not add anything to the\nformidable public record inculpating her. And no family member of hers has expressed a\nposition on the motion to unseal. Gov’t Mem. at 6. This factor is neutral.\nVe Extent to Which the Desired Material Has Previously Been Made\nPublic\n“T]he extent to which the grand jury material in a particular case has been made public\nis clearly relevant because even partial previous disclosure often undercuts many of the reasons\nfor secrecy.” See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7. Here, as explained, substantially all the\ninformation testified to by the summary witnesses in the grand juries has been revealed at\nMaxwell’s trial. And the Government proposes to redact victim identities, consistent with the\napproach that it took at trial. This factor is consistent with unsealing.\n8. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might be\nAffected by Disclosure Are Still Alive\nBoth law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents who testified are still alive. Gov’t Mem. at 7. The\nGovernment, houever, proposes to redact their names. This factor is neutral.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 28 of 3l\n9. Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third\nparties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their\nnames and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed\nredactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\nlo. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, leters on behalf of\nnumerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 8o4, 8o6. Their leters address whether\nthe Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about\nrecent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe leters, in the main, urge broad disclosure of the Government’s investigative records\nregarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the\nMaxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted\nto protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 8o4 at 6 (“We are in full agreement with the\npublic disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related\ninformation and documents in the possession and control of law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, prosecutorial[, ]\nand other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The\nvictims’ interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the\nunderstandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information. See, e.g.,\nid. at lo (“Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would allou additional important information to\nemerge... .”’); id. at 9 (“[T]he instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and\nabhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes.”).

The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nApp.o3l\nDOJ-OGR-oool949o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019493.jpg": "Cased ADAH SBos AT en (dc WHE 2o2 FiRAB62 8l /Pageyei4l ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Regardless, after Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent\nWilliam Sweeney went even further, calling Ms. Maxwell “one of the villains in this\ninvestigation” and compared her to a snake that “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New\nHampshire.” Thus, Mr. Sweeney offers the Government’s, again flatly wrong, opinions about\ncharacter and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a semi-biblical reference involving a snake\nslithering away to a garden in New Hampshire. These types of comments, which serve no\ncompelling law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this\nDistrict.\n\nNew York atorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several\nwitnesses in this mater, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in\nrecent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.l, which\napplies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically.\nSee Rule 23.l(a) and (b).\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited\nsubject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in\nviolation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:\n\nBoies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as\n\nshe looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence.\n\nMaxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with\n\nother wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with\n\nunderaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public\n\nstature who were involved with Epstein.”4\nMs. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go\naway but today is a step touard healing.” Jd.\n\nBradley Edwards, another atorney representing witnesses in this mater made similar\npresumptively prejudicial statements follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°\n\n‘The reality of hou this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was\n\norchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual satisfaction.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case.

This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v.

The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government.

The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019893.jpg": "CaS 922 LcrDISSCUAUN DstamtePl &Pitdd BPP POH Pager Gt 2o\nout of public view after Epstein’s arrest, which the government seeks to portray as “hiding”\nfrom the law.

In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019910.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8ooBB8oHAEN ISahuMeht 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPaheB26ol9\nappear to depend on any job — or to have depended on any employment in the past 3o years — for\nthe privileged lifestyle she has maintained for the entirety of that period. The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool99lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019911.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8ooB8oHAEN ISACuMEent 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPageb26ol9\nmake purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government announced\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difterence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool99ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019954.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page95 of 2oo i\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl she passes. In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 transaction under a fake name and not be detected. So there\n\n5 really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie\n6 about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the\n7 means to do so. All of those things should be extremely\n\n8 concerning to the court, your Honor, as the court evaluates\n\n9 whether the defendant has the ability and willingness to live\nlo off the grid indefinitely.

She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her.

(Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo45", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020052.jpg": "Casesb: 2o-68o o88oHAGN ISAC UMENT D2 FileG68a3o/PtagPage BB26lo45\n\nThe discovery also does not contain any police reports in which the people we\nbelieve to be the complainants reported the alleged crimes to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020080.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGHANt BEctIMerf loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPaAge Ota 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. As set forth in\nExhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the\nextradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for\nwhich extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

(See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020085.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBGlANt DEctuMerf loo2 Filed6Ra38/?tgPageP Staf 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted. (See Tr. 87).\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020133.jpg": "CaGade2ZOtehd3GouAuNt BibSutre/ntl l2o lF kG 3228o/2eg Falgef d O6 22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services.

Jd. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that detention was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25—29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol33", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020146.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagel bof 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol46", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020253.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel9 of 25\n\n35. Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was\nentirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case. This is not a case where the\nGovernment “simply stat[ed] in general and conclusory terms what it hoped to\nprove,” or where the Government proffered the statements of a single witness with\na history of perjury. Lafontaine, 2lo F.3d at l3l.

Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978). As with the\nredactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrouly\ntailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties\npersonal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 46o, 467\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). See also Dkt. No. 95. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket\nthe redacted documents and corresponding exhibits by no later than December 23,\n2o2o. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and\nOrder concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's\nmotion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on l2/28/2o)(jw) (Entered: l2/28/2o2o)\n\nl2/3o/2o2o | lo5 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

The Court held a\nlengthy bail hearing on July l4, 2o2o. After extensive briefing and argument at the\nhearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no\nconditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021184.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya ae 3536o38, Pagel2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021188.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel6 of 258\nSA-l4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021189.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel7 of 258\nSA-l5\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 348\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW <span class=\"highlight\">ENFORCEMENT</span> AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n: Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.\n\nDuring the period most relevant to this Report, the Atorney General was Michael\nMukasey, the Deputy Atorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Atorney General for\nthe Criminal Division was Alice Fisher. The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterban.\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal\nmaters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-\nDade, Brouard, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and\nHighlands, an area of over l5,ooo square miles. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nUSAO had a staff of approximately 2oo Assistant U.S. Atorneys (AUSAs) and 2oo support\npersonnel. The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief. During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm\nBeach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency\nand is part of the Department.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021206.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O33 3536o38, Page34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 348\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher. Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021215.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONAL 3536o38, Page43 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4l of 348\n\ntold OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought atorney Alan Dershouitz to see Krischer and the\nAssistant State Atorney, but Dershouitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, ““We’re going\nto destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.” According\nto Krischer, Dershouitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local atorney Jack\nGoldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.” Because the husband of the\nAssistant State Atorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the Assistant State\nAtorney to remove “‘even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took\nover the case. Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'! Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because .. . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes .. . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, ... I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.!* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nAo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nu Because the Florida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nR U.S. Const. amend.

During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021241.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page69 of 258\nSA-67\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\n<span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed.\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\nag The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l255", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021281.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo7 3536o38, Pagelo9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. !?”\nls Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl28 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nWa The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021307.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel35 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 348\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021308.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel36 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”!®8 Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021321.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NAT 3536o38, Pagel49 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021327.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l53 3536o38, Pagel55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021335.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel63 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021344.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel72 of 258\nSA-l7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021377.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o3 3536o38, Page2o5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 348\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “‘pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain ‘“‘an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:7°°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nI. THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n\n267 OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l392", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021414.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34o 3536o38, Page242 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021418.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 344 3536o38, Page246 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”3”? Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> personnel shall ensure” that victims\nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the\nvictim[.]” Fla. Stat. § 96o.ool(l)(a) (2oo7). Victims were also entitled to submit an oral or writen impact statement.\nFla. Stat. § 96o.ool(l)k) (2oo7). Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family\nof the victim must be consulted by the state atorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the\ndisposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.

Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“Tt]here’s several” victims.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”?”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”38! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings. 3°”\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “‘conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nice See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 7 G.2, available at htps://www-justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag_guidelines2ol2. pdf.

Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\ncd Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021460.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 384 3536o39, Page3o of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.’ Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nTW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023008.jpg": "investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n2 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023012.jpg": "VI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ol2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023016.jpg": "NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3.

At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nIW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o2l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023022.jpg": "investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n2 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o22", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023026.jpg": "that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o26", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023027.jpg": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we .. .\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the tme OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nl2 U.S. Const. amend.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\nae State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023079.jpg": "In light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\n<span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span>], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atomey, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.jpg": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody.

In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements.

The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him.

Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting.

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'®° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims.

May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”?

In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l58", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023159.jpg": "him/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> priorities; !”°\n\n2, The nature and seriousness of the offense; '*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4. The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023165.jpg": "flexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a. l96\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-<span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.jpg": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023173.jpg": "unambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.jpg": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.” Witnesses,\nincluding law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023182.jpg": "considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\nBs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... Itis\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.jpg": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.7** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023215.jpg": "the federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence.

Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw <span class=\"highlight\">Enforcement</span> Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:7°°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nWW. THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°7 On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?\n\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n267 OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2323o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023252.jpg": "the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at —_ a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023256.jpg": "review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “‘to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> personnel shall ensure” that victims\nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the\nvictim[.]” Fla. Stat. § 96o.ool(l)(a) (2oo7). Victims were also entitled to submit an oral or writen impact statement.\nFla. Stat. § 96o.ool(l)ck) (2oo7). Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family\nof the victim must be consulted by the state atorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the\ndisposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.

I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea.*°° Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”*°! As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“It]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafa edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023279.jpg": "F. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”**! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 9 G.2, available at htps://“www justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\nBL See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings. The 2oll revision\nremedied this omission.\n\n24l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023280.jpg": "Department had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”>*\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\n\n384 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2328o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023296.jpg": "In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023320.jpg": "to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\nca In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n“48 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n282\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.jpg": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023342.jpg": "of Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting,\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\ncommercial sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office;\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

Noel said that during her shift on August lo, 2ol9, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other\nthan the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG\ndetermined that at approximately lo:4o p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up\nto the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein\nwas housed.\n2. Lieutenant Rounds\nBOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being\nfolloued. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at\nleast once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log\nbook, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations\nLieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the\nOperations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and\nperiodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is\nresponsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span> of rules, review of paperwork,\ncoordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make\nrounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.\nThe statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The Northeast Regional\nDirector, the Warden, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the\nOIG that Lieutenants should have walked doun all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in\nthe SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, houever, other Lieutenants did not\nalways walk doun the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to\nstore the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that\nthe assigned COs and Lieutenants walked doun each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and\ninmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and lo, 2ol9, houever, the MCC\nNew York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather\nthan at the end of each tier.\nNone of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and lo alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that\nEpstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant\nconducted a round in the SHU at ll:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did\nnot specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou that\nEpstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his\nshift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a\nLieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not knou that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New\nYork or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not\natended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the\nAugust 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a\nround in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the\nround.

The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and\nresponsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll\nCall notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Atorney\nLog Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the\nAtorney Visiting area were not secured.

BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the\nreconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,\nentries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not consistently sign in and\nout, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently\nlabeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been\ntorn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an\nadequate system of control and monitoring.\n\nlo.

An Aggravated Assault Conviction Might Subject the Client to Sex-Registration\nThere is a likely risk that a plea to aggravated assault, E.S.A. § 784.o2l(l)(b), will expose\nthe client to registration obligations under the Megan’s Law statutes, either as currently writen,\nor as likely to be amended or expanded in the future, in a number of jurisdictions, including, but\nnot limited to, ones whete he lives, works, or spends time. This is true regardless of whether the\nplea expressly specifies that the felony he had the intent to commit was lewd and lascivious :\nbehavior under F.S.A. § 8oo.o4 or sexual batery under F.S.A. § 794.oll.\nAs my client is a full time resident of the Virgin Islands, the most immediate and obvious\nunintended result of a plea to felony aggravated assault is the possible registration in his placc of\nresidency. The Virgin Islands statute, l4 V.I.C. § l722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to\nregister upon a “person convicted ... on or after July l, l994 of a criminal offense against a i\nminor”. l4 V.I.C. § l722(a) (emphasis added). Under § l722 (c), “a person convicted ... ina ;\nfedcral, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under :\nthis statute,” Failure to register is a crime. l4 VLC. § l722(d), Further, while the Virgin Islands\nregistry is currently acecssible only to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, there are ongoing discussions about\nopening it to the public. See, Virgin Islands Daily News, May l5, 2oo6, at\nhtp:/Awww.virginislandsdaily news.com/index.pl/article home?id=l7296624.!\nUnder current law, a plea to aggravated assault will also likely subject the client to\nregistration in his secondary domicile of New York. The list of registrable offenses in New York }\nunder the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) is a long one, which continues to grou. In\nl999, eight new offenses were added to the list of registrable offenses, and again on March ll,\n2oo2, seven new offenses were added, i\n: A non-exhaustive search has identified two other jurisdictions in which the client would appear to be |\nsubject to registration requirements simply on the basis of a plea, in Florida, to aggravated assault - Oklahoma and\nMontana. |\n|\nOklahoma requires the registration of persons convicted of assault with intent to commit a felomy, in |\nviolation of 2l Oki, St. Ann, § 68l \"if the offense involved sexual assault.” See, 57 OkL.

LercouRT, P.C.\nMs. Lanna Belohlavek :\nJune 5, 2oo6\nPage 2\nL An Aggravated Assault Conviction Might Subject the Client to Sex-Registration\n\nThere is a likely risk that a plea to aggravated assault, F.S.A. § 784.o2l(l)(b), will expose\nthe client to registration obligations under the Megan’s Law statutes, either as currently writen,\nor as likely to be amended or expanded in the future, in a number of jurisdictions, including, but\nnot limited to, ones where he lives, works, or spends time. This is true regardless of whether the\nplea expressly specifies that the felony he had the intent to commit was lewd and lascivious\nbehavior under F.S.A. § 8oo.o4 or sexual batery under F.S.A. § 794.oll.\n\nAs my client is a full time resident of the Virgin Islands, the most immediate and obvious\nunintended result of a plea to felony aggravated assault is the possible registration in his place of\nresidency. The Virgin Islands statute, l4 V.I.C. § l722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to\nregister upon a “person convicted ... on or after July l, l994 of a criminal offense against a\nminor”. l4 V.I.C. § l722(a) (emphasis added). Under § l722 (c), “a person convicted ... ina\nfederal, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under\nthis statute.” Failure to register is a crime. l4 V.LC. § l722(d). Further, while the Virgin Islands\nregistry is currently accessible only to law <span class=\"highlight\">enforcement</span>, there are ongoing discussions about\nopening it to the public. See, Virgin Islands Daily News, May l5, 2oo6, at\nhtp://www.virginislandsdaily news.com/index.pl/article_ home?id=l7296624.\n\nUnder current law, a plea to aggravated assault will also likely subject the client to\nregistration in his secondary domicile of New York. The list of registrable offenses in New York\nunder the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) is a long one, which continues to grou. In\nl999, eight new offenses were added to the list of registrable offenses, and again on March ll,\n2oo2, seven new offenses were added.\n\n‘ A non-exhaustive search has identified two other jurisdictions in which the client would appear to be\nsubject to registration requirements simply on the basis of a plea, in Florida, to aggravated assault - Oklahoma and\nMontana.\n\nOklahoma requires the registration of persons convicted of assault with intent to commit a felony, in\nviolation of 2l Okl. St. Ann. § 68l \"if the offense involved sexual assault.\" See, 57 Okl. St. Ann. § 582 (A).\nOklahoma law requires the registration, too, of persons convicted of an offense outside the jurisdiction which, if\ncommited in the state, would constitute a registrable offense. 57 Okl. St. Ann. § 582(B).\n\nLikewise, Montana requires registration of both sexual offenders and violent offenders. “Violent offenders\"\ninclude persons convicted of any violent offense, which is expressly defined to include \"aggravated assault\" under\nMCA 45-o5-2o2, or \"any violation of a law of another state ... reasonably equivalent\" to that crime.
