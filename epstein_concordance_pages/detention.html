Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (l984), reprinted in l984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3l82, 3l89. And that’s true no mater hou much rhetoric and hyperbole the\ngovernment and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,\ncompelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations\nof conduct from l4 to l7 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\nanticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered\n' New York’s age of consent was l7 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.\n\nSee N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.o5.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000276.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 3 of l6\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, his principal residence, Florida, and New York. Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been\nmeticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise\nlocation every single day for the past lo years. Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l.

Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at\npreventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F.

See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag\nbetween the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000283.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lo of l6\n\nTo reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “/east restrictive”\nconditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)\n(emphasis added). Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial.

Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v.

Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense.

Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity.

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defendant’s Motion for\nPretrial Release (the “Release Motion’), dated July ll, 2ol9 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its\nMemorandum in Support of <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memo”), submited to Magistrate Judge\nPitman on July 8, 2ol9, which is atached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that classification louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000330.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, Pretrial Services has recommended\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and victims of the defendant seek his <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000331.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 3of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000334.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 6ofl4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 6\ncontained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000336.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 8 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 8\n4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape atempt while in the community and involving\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000337.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 9 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\narmed private guards atempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—trather than the\ndefendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the\ndefendant’s flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y.\n2ol9). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in\nfacilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities.” /d. at 258 (citing Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d at 74 n.l3 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force\nmay need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ...

United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, l36 F. Supp. 2d l25, l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool))); Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would\nsuggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has\na statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location.”).\n\nThe defendant’s payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having\nthe defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding\nhim, leaving the company’s incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v. Tajideen, l7 Cr. o46, 2ol8\nWL l342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. l5, 2ol8) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further\nnoting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's\nsecurity detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's\njurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the pouer of money and its potential to corrupt or\nundermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Pitman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled\nfor July 8, 2ol9, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should\norder that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\n\nAs set forth belou, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is\nalleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years,\nand he nou faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted\nevidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the substantial\nincarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of\nflight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ounership of and access to private\nplanes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of\nthe defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned\nfrom a multi-week stay abroad.\n\nFinally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past\nexperience with this defendant—that if alloued to remain out on bail, the defendant could atempt\nto pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and\ntheir families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger\nto the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight.\nThe defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is appropriate in this\ncase, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is sufficient, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were an\n\nevidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3l42(e) case in\n\nwhich an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering\n\nthat which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000348.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page6oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 6\nMultiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information\nagainst the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances,\nby other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as\nfurther detailed belou, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the\ndefendant’s arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude\nyoung women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials,\nsuch as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant’s residence that include\nnames and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and\nhis agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply,\nall of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually\nabused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be\ndevastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nFinally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant’s previous non-\nprosecution agreement (“NPA”) with a different federal district pose any impediment to his\nconviction. Asan initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\ndate of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v.\nChief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because Congress extended the statute\nof limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still\nrunning, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same).\nMoreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New\nYork was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL\ninvestigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude\nprosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well setled in the Second Circuit\nthat “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind\nanother.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”) (citing United States\nv. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the\nagreement purports to bind “the Government.” See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. This analysis\nsimilarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l,\n854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement\nto the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States\nAtorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit,\nwhich presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can\naffirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”) (citing Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely\nthe presumptions and the § 3l42(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be\ndetained.”’).\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000349.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page /7oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 7\nconduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000352.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page looflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage lo\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive\ninternational travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Accordingly, the government joins the\nl6 recommendation of Pretrial Services that the defendant be\nl7 detained pending trial for a number of reasons.\nl8 Starting with the conduct alleged, the defendant is\nl9 charged with trafficking minors for sex acts, as the court\n2o explained, in violation of l8 United States Code § 59l, and is\n2l charged with a count of conspiracy to traffic minors for sex\n22 acts in violation of l8 U.S.C. 37l.\n23 In particular, the indictment charges that the\n24 defendant engaged in a years-long scheme to sexually abuse\n25 underage girls, paying minor girls to themselves be abused, and\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000412.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 2o Filed o7/l6/l9 Page 7 of 24 7\nj782epsC kjc\n\nl The government notes as an initial mater that this is\n2 a presumption case because sex trafficking is charged; and,\n\n3 moreover, each of the four factors to be considered in the\n\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> analysis strongly militates touards pretrial\n\n5 <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\n6 So starting with the nature and seriousness of the\n\n7 offense, as previously discussed, the nature and circumstances\n8 of the crime are the most serious crime that this court sees.\n\n9 The defendant is alleged to have spent years sexually abusing\nlo minors in multiple locations and with dozens of victims.\n\nll The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the\nl2 potential penalties, which include up to 45 combined years of\nl3 incarceration on Counts One and Two, and the likelihood of a\n\nl4 substantial period of incarceration is supported by the fact\n\nl5 that the government's evidence is strong.

It would be impossible for Mr.\nEpstein — given, among other impediments, his <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, inability to\nquickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly make a precise\nvaluation of particular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement\nby the Court’s 5pm deadline. Mr. Epstein certainly recognizes the Court’s\nrequest for further transparency and is commited to providing a\ncomplete and accurate disclosure.

Payments to Potential Witnesses!\n\nIn a July l2, 2ol9 leter, the Government informed the Court that the Government had\nrecently obtained records from a financial institution (“Institution-l”) that appeared to shou the\ndefendant had made suspicious payments shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing, on\napproximately November 28, 2ol8, a series of articles relating to the defendant, his alleged sexual\nmisconduct, and the circumstances under which he entered into a non-prosecution agreement\n(“NPA”) with the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2oo7. The same\nseries highlighted the involvement of several of Epstein’s former employees and associates in the\nalleged sexual abuse. At the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Hearing, the Court asked the Government to provide\nadditional information about the individuals to whom these payments appear to have been made.\n\nFirst, records from Institution-l shou that on or about November 3o, 2ol8, or two days\nafter the series in the Miami Herald began, the defendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he\na potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein obtained protection in—the NPA.

This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that\nshe and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant’s trafficking of minors by, among\nother things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his\nresidences in Manhatan and Palm Beach, Florida. This individual was also named and featured\nprominently in the Herald series.\nII. Police Report\n\nDuring the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach\npolice report, which was annexed to the Government’s July l2, 2ol9 <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> memorandum. At\nthe Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report\npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the\npolice report is atached as Exhibit A.\n\nIll. Foreign Passport\n\nDuring the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently\nlearned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the\n“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence during the execution of a\nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2ol9. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to\ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto\nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States\npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign\nPassport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the\nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits\nB and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the\nongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under\nseal.\n\nThe Government is atempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport,\nincluding hou it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the\ndefendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to\nthe inference the defendant knous hou to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other,\nforeign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.”\n> The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has\nbeen in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To\ndate, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen\nor permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming\nevidence of risk of flight.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000442.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 23 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page 3of3\nHon.

Cash and Diamonds\nAt the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash\nwere seized from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence. The Court inquired as to the value\nof these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials\nfrom the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $7o,ooo in cash. In\naddition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately l carat\nto 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether\nthe defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other\nlocations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the\njurisdiction at a moment’s notice.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2ol9 and July l2, 2ol9\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> memoranda, and on the record at the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Hearing, the Court should order that the\ndefendant be detained pending trial. The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\nRespectfully submited,\nGEOFFREY S.

Stripped to its core,\nthe government’s position — as urged in its leters and echoed again\nyesterday — distills to this: the nominally rebutable remand\npresumption (connected with l8 USC § l59l charges)! plus Epstein’s\n!

It would be impossible for Epstein — given,\namong other impediments, his <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, inability to quickly access\npertinent records, and inability to quickly make a precise valuation of\nparticular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement by the\nCourt’s 5 pm deadline.

Accordingly, we propose that the Court preliminarily\naccept the initial disclosure proffered last Friday and, if intending to\ngrant bail, include a release condition directing Epstein to tender a\ncomprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as expeditiously as\npracticable.

Indictment\nA grand jury voted to indict Mr. Epstein on or about July 2, 2ol9. The Indictment\ncharges Mr. Epstein with two felonies involving minor girls some as young as l4. Count I |\nincludes conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minor girls, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, and\nCount II includes sex trafficking of minor girls, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. It states:\n“{F]rom at least in or about 2oo2, up to and including at least in or about 2oo5, Jeffrey Epstein, .\n. .enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion\nin Manhatan, New York . . . and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, . . . to engage in sex acts with\nhim, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.” Indictment, dated July\n2, 2ol9 (“Indictment”), § 2. “Moreover, and in order to maintain, and increase his supply of\nvictims, Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused\nby Epstein. In this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually\nexploit in locations including New York and Palm Beach.” Id.\nThe Indictment also charges that “the victims . .. were as young as l4 years old at the.\ntime they were abused by [Mr. Epstein] . . . and were, for various reasons, often particularly !\nvulnerable to exploitation.” Id. § 3. “Mr. Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that\nmany of his victims were in fact under the age of l8, [] because, in some instances, minor |\nvictims expressly told him their age.” Id.\nFollouing his arrest, on Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arraigned and presented .\nwith the Indictment by Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman.\nD. Legal Principles Governing Release Versus Remand\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42, a Court can order a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nif it determines that the defendant is either (l) a danger to the community or (2) a risk of flight.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000479.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 8 of 33 |\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A Court does not need to find both bases are proven to order a defendant’s\ni\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See id.; United States v. Blanco, 57o F. App’x 76, 78 (2d Cir. 2ol4). Dangerousness\n\nmeans that the defendant is a “danger to the safety of any other person or the community.” l8\n\nU.S.C. § 3l42. A finding of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir. l995). “Where there is a strong\n\nprobability that a person will commit additional crimes if released, the need to protect the |\n\ncommunity becomes sufficiently compelling that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is, on balance, appropriate.” United\n\nStates v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o3 (2d Cir. l985). “[E]ven a single incident of witness\n\ntampering . . . [may be] sufficient to revoke bail.” LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d at l34.\n\nTo order <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based upon risk of flight, the Court must find by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that “that no conditions could reasonably assure the defendant's presence at trial.” |\nSee, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. “[T]he |\n\nconstitutional limits on a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> period based on dangerousness to the community may be\n\nlooser than the limits on a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> period based solely on risk of flight. In the former case,\n\nrelease risks injury to others, while in the later case, release risks only the loss of a conviction.”\n\nUnited States v. Millan, 4 F.3d lo38, lo48 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Orena, 986\n\nF.2d 628, 63l (2d Cir. l993)). A bail package that “may reasonably assure the appearance of [the\n\ndefendant] at trial will not [necessarily] assure the safety of the community.” United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act sets forth the follouing four factors to be considered in the\nrelease/remand analysis: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crime(s) charged; (2) the weight |\nof the evidence against the person; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including\nthe person’s character and financial resources; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000480.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 9 of 33 .\ndefendant’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). “The weight afforded to each factor under section |\n3l42(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district court.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. :\nSupp. 3d 6oo, 6lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (quoting United States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. |\nl987). |\n\n“The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the |\npresentation and consideration of information at the [release/remand] hearing.” l8 U.S.C. § :\n\n3l42(f)(2) (emphasis added). For example, the Government is entitled to present evidence\nsupporting remand by way of proffer, among other means. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2); see also\ni United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“bail hearings are typically\n\ninformal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery”). l8 U.S.C. § 3l42((2)(B)\nexpressly states that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at bail hearings; thus, courts\noften base <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> decisions on hearsay evidence. United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9,\n32l n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) “District courts [are afforded] wide discretion regarding the scope of such\nhearings... .” United States v. Bartok, 472 F. App’x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nE. The Presumption of Remand in l8 U.S.C. § l59l Cases |\n\nA l8 U.S.C. § l59l case involving sexual victimization of a minor is unusual in that it\nincludes a presumption in favor of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, reflecting the significant harm caused by\nsuch a crime. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The presumption is that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure against flight or danger to the community. United States v.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may\nrebut the presumption by “coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nGovernment retains the “ultimate burden of persuasion” that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo48o /\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000481.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 _ Filed o7/l8/l9 Page lo of 33 |\ncommunity (by clear and convincing evidence) and that Mr. Epstein presents a risk of flight (by\na preponderance of the evidence). Id. Even if rebutal evidence is presented, “the presumption\nfavoring <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does not disappear entirely.” Id. at 436. “[It] remains a factor to be considered |\namong those weighed by the district court.” Id.\nF. Mr. Epstein Poses a Danger To Others And To the Community\nThe Court begins with “dangerousness” because that concept is at the heart of this case. It\nfinds that the Government has shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein\nthreatens the safety of another person and of the community, as follous on pages lo-2l: |\ne Victims Have Advised The Court That They Would Fear For Their Safety If Mr.\nEpstein Were Released\nVictims have “specifically conveyed” to the Government that any form of release of the\nDefendant, including home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> with full-time private guards, could “result in [their] !\nharassment and abuse.” Dkt. ll at 4. At the bail hearing on July l5, 2ol9, two victims movingly\ntestified about their past sexual encounters with Mr. Epstein when they were minors aged l4 and\nl6, respectively. 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 72; see also S. REP. lo8-l9l (“CVRA Legislative History”), at\n22 (In enacting the CVRA, Congress stated that “[V ]Jictims deserve the right to be heard at\nspecific points in the criminal justice process,” including bail hearings. “Giving victims a voice\nnot only improves the quality of the process but can also be expected to often provide important\nbenefits to victims.”). Ms. Annie Farmer was introduced by her counsel, David Boies, and stated\nthat she was l6 years old when she “had the misfortune of meeting Jeffrey Epstein [in] New\nYork.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 72. Ms. Farmer said that Mr. Epstein “flew [her] to New Mexico” and was |\n“inappropriate” with her. Id. She was reluctant to go into details about her experience with Mr. |\nEpstein. Id. at 73.

She asked the Court |\nto “keep [Mr. Epstein] in <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> [] for the safety of any other girls out there that are going\nthrough what [she’s] going through.” Id. at 74. Ms. Wild said that Mr. Epstein is a “scary person\n\n| to have walking the streets.” Id.\ne Mr. Epstein Poses A Threat to Additional Young Girls If He Is Released\n\nAt the remand/release hearing on Monday, July l5, 2ol9, as noted, the Court heard\npoignant testimony from two of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims about their fears and anxiety over\nhis potential release, even if under strict conditions of home confinement. The Court is also |\nconcerned for new victims.\n\nMr. Epstein’s alleged excessive atraction to sexual conduct with or in the presence of\nminor girls — which is said to include his soliciting and receiving massages from young girls and\nyoung women perhaps as many as four times a day — appears likely to be uncontrollable. See\nUnited States v. Minnici, l28 F. App’x 827, 829-3o (2d Cir. 2oo5) (defendant’s alleged sex\ncrimes were “of an addictive sexual nature that cannot be suppressed simply by a restrictive set\nof bail conditions”). Accordingly, Mr. Epstein’s past sexual conduct is not likely to have abated\nor been successfully suppressed by fierce determination, as his Defense Counsel suggests.\n\nDefense Counsel contends that: “[H]e wasn’t a predator that couldn’t contro! his conduct. He\ndisciplined himself.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 3l-32. Defense Counsel also argues that “appreciating the\ngravity of these charges . . . puting aside the age of these witnesses and puting the consent issue\naside, it’s not like [Epstein is] an out-of-control rapist.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 36.

See Dkt. ll, Ex. l at 9. The search\nresults suggest the “possibility that defendant could target another vulnerable victim.” See\nUnited States v. Baker, 349 F. Supp. 3d ll3, ll35 (D.N.M. 2ol8) (where the defendant was\n| alleged to specifically target “vulnerable women” and where he atempted to contact an alleged\nvictim, the court was persuaded that the defendant “would be a danger to society if released”’).\nDespite having been convicted of the above mentioned (two) Florida sex crimes (in 2oo8)\ninvolving an underage girl, Mr. Epstein, as noted, maintained at his New York residence a “‘vast\ntrove” of sexually suggestive photographs of nude underage and adult girls. Dkt. ll, Ex. l at 9.\nThat is, during the July 6-7, 2ol9 authorized search of Mr. Epstein’s NYC residence, the FBI\nfound a “substantial collection of photographic trophies of his victims and other young females.”\nDkt. ll at lo. This evidence includes compact discs labeled “Young [Redacted Name] +\n[Redacted Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and Girl pics nude.” Id. The Government contends that this\nevidence includes hundreds or perhaps thousands of “sexually suggestive photographs” of nude\nunderage girls and women, and that it is corroborative in nature. Id. And, it is consistent with\nvictim recollections of the inside of Mr. Epstein’s residence. Dkt. ll, Ex. l at 9. This newly :\ndiscovered evidence also suggests that Mr. Epstein poses “ongoing and forward-looking danger.”\nSee Dkt. ll at lo; see also Baker, 349 F. Supp. 3d at ll35; United States v.

Among its\ndeficiencies are these:\n(l) The bail package is not accompanied or supported by audited or certified financial |\nstatements, including details of income and expenses and debt obligations. There is no affidavit |\nfrom Mr. Epstein. As noted, Defense counsel submited a cursory one page “Asset Summary - |\nJune 3o, 2ol9\" on Mr. Epstein’s behalf in which he discloses several categories of assets totaling |\n$559,l2o,954. The Defense states that it “would be impossible for Epstein — given, among other :\n!\nimpediments, his <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, inability to quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly |\nmake a precise valuation of particular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement by the |\nCourt’s 5 pm deadline.” Dkt. 23 at 4. |\nThe absence of accurate and comprehensive financials, sworn to by the Defendant, does |\nnot allou the Court meaningfully to assess Defendants’ oun proposed bail package nor would it |\nenable the Court to fashion a bail package on its oun. The Court would not be able to determine :\nwhat level of bail — in relation to Epstein’s finances ~ would reasonably assure the Defendant’s |\nappearance. Defense counsel proposed at the bail hearing on July l5, 2ol9 that it would take a |\nfew days to prepare accurate financials for Mr. Epstein. He also suggested that he would do so\n(only) if the Court were agreeable to granting bail. This “offer” appears disingenuous for a\nperson as wealthy and experienced in financial maters as Mr. Epstein. See Tr. 7/l5/l9 at 5o |\n(Court: “There needs to be a fuller financial picture to knou what would be appropriate.”\nDefense Counsel: “Let me be blunt. It was our first effort ....”).

The stakes are grave,\n\n8 and one of the most important reasons for Mr. Epstein's release\n9 is to permit him the right to fully prepare a defense.\n\nlo The second reason that before l984 there was an\n\nll entitlement to bail was because of the presumption of innocence\nl2 and because of the basic premise of the American criminal\n\nl3 justice system that you don't punish first and have a trial\n\nl4 second; that non-convicted citizens don't get detained which is\nl5 essentially a label for punishment.\n\nl6 There is no way to replace the freedom if Mr. Epstein\nl7 is to prevail on these charges.

Indictment\nA grand jury voted to indict Mr. Epstein on or about July 2, 2ol9. The Indictment\ncharges Mr. Epstein with two felonies involving minor girls some as young as l4. Count I |\nincludes conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minor girls, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, and\nCount II includes sex trafficking of minor girls, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. It states:\n“{F]rom at least in or about 2oo2, up to and including at least in or about 2oo5, Jeffrey Epstein, .\n. .enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion\nin Manhatan, New York . . . and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, . . . to engage in sex acts with\nhim, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.” Indictment, dated July\n2, 2ol9 (“Indictment”), § 2. “Moreover, and in order to maintain, and increase his supply of\nvictims, Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused\nby Epstein. In this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually\nexploit in locations including New York and Palm Beach.” Id.\nThe Indictment also charges that “the victims . .. were as young as l4 years old at the.\ntime they were abused by [Mr. Epstein] . . . and were, for various reasons, often particularly !\nvulnerable to exploitation.” Id. § 3. “Mr. Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that\nmany of his victims were in fact under the age of l8, [] because, in some instances, minor |\nvictims expressly told him their age.” Id.\nFollouing his arrest, on Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arraigned and presented .\nwith the Indictment by Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman.\nD. Legal Principles Governing Release Versus Remand\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42, a Court can order a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nif it determines that the defendant is either (l) a danger to the community or (2) a risk of flight.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000791.jpg": "Cas@’4Sfol4-4648o-RMB DbeuMenPsh Piles HY lSuisageaye FoF 33 :\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A Court does not need to find both bases are proven to order a defendant’s\ni\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See id.; United States v. Blanco, 57o F. App’x 76, 78 (2d Cir. 2ol4). Dangerousness\nmeans that the defendant is a “danger to the safety of any other person or the community.” l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42. A finding of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir. l995). “Where there is a strong\nprobability that a person will commit additional crimes if released, the need to protect the |\ncommunity becomes sufficiently compelling that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is, on balance, appropriate.” United\nStates v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o3 (2d Cir. l985). “[E]ven a single incident of witness\ntampering . . . [may be] sufficient to revoke bail.” LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d at l34.\n\nTo order <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based upon risk of flight, the Court must find by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that “that no conditions could reasonably assure the defendant's presence at trial.” |\nSee, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. “[T]he |\n\nconstitutional limits on a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> period based on dangerousness to the community may be\n\nlooser than the limits on a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> period based solely on risk of flight. In the former case,\n\nrelease risks injury to others, while in the later case, release risks only the loss of a conviction.”\n\nUnited States v. Millan, 4 F.3d lo38, lo48 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Orena, 986\n\nF.2d 628, 63l (2d Cir. l993)). A bail package that “may reasonably assure the appearance of [the\n\ndefendant] at trial will not [necessarily] assure the safety of the community.” United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act sets forth the follouing four factors to be considered in the\nrelease/remand analysis: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crime(s) charged; (2) the weight |\nof the evidence against the person; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including\nthe person’s character and financial resources; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo79l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000792.jpg": "Cas@-4Sfol4-4648o-RMB DbeuMenPsh Piles OY lsuisageaye FoF 33 |\ndefendant’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). “The weight afforded to each factor under section |\n3l42(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district court.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. :\nSupp. 3d 6oo, 6lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (quoting United States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. |\nl987). |\n\n“The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the |\npresentation and consideration of information at the [release/remand] hearing.” l8 U.S.C. § :\n\n3l42(f)(2) (emphasis added). For example, the Government is entitled to present evidence\nsupporting remand by way of proffer, among other means. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2); see also\ni United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“bail hearings are typically\n\ninformal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery”). l8 U.S.C. § 3l42((2)(B)\nexpressly states that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at bail hearings; thus, courts\noften base <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> decisions on hearsay evidence. United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9,\n32l n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) “District courts [are afforded] wide discretion regarding the scope of such\nhearings... .” United States v. Bartok, 472 F. App’x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nE. The Presumption of Remand in l8 U.S.C. § l59l Cases |\n\nA l8 U.S.C. § l59l case involving sexual victimization of a minor is unusual in that it\nincludes a presumption in favor of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, reflecting the significant harm caused by\nsuch a crime. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The presumption is that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure against flight or danger to the community. United States v.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may\nrebut the presumption by “coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nGovernment retains the “ultimate burden of persuasion” that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo792 /\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000793.jpg": "Cas@4Sol6-2646o- RMB DbeuMeAPs? l PileG OV lsu8aged Gig SF 33 |\ncommunity (by clear and convincing evidence) and that Mr. Epstein presents a risk of flight (by\na preponderance of the evidence). Id. Even if rebutal evidence is presented, “the presumption\nfavoring <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does not disappear entirely.” Id. at 436. “[It] remains a factor to be considered |\namong those weighed by the district court.” Id.\nF. Mr. Epstein Poses a Danger To Others And To the Community\nThe Court begins with “dangerousness” because that concept is at the heart of this case. It\nfinds that the Government has shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein\nthreatens the safety of another person and of the community, as follous on pages lo-2l: |\ne Victims Have Advised The Court That They Would Fear For Their Safety If Mr.\nEpstein Were Released\nVictims have “specifically conveyed” to the Government that any form of release of the\nDefendant, including home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> with full-time private guards, could “result in [their] !\nharassment and abuse.” Dkt. ll at 4. At the bail hearing on July l5, 2ol9, two victims movingly\ntestified about their past sexual encounters with Mr. Epstein when they were minors aged l4 and\nl6, respectively. 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 72; see also S. REP. lo8-l9l (“CVRA Legislative History”), at\n22 (In enacting the CVRA, Congress stated that “[V ]Jictims deserve the right to be heard at\nspecific points in the criminal justice process,” including bail hearings. “Giving victims a voice\nnot only improves the quality of the process but can also be expected to often provide important\nbenefits to victims.”). Ms. Annie Farmer was introduced by her counsel, David Boies, and stated\nthat she was l6 years old when she “had the misfortune of meeting Jeffrey Epstein [in] New\nYork.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 72. Ms. Farmer said that Mr. Epstein “flew [her] to New Mexico” and was |\n“inappropriate” with her. Id. She was reluctant to go into details about her experience with Mr. |\nEpstein. Id. at 73.

She asked the Court |\nto “keep [Mr. Epstein] in <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> [] for the safety of any other girls out there that are going\nthrough what [she’s] going through.” Id. at 74. Ms. Wild said that Mr. Epstein is a “scary person\n\n| to have walking the streets.” Id.\ne Mr. Epstein Poses A Threat to Additional Young Girls If He Is Released\n\nAt the remand/release hearing on Monday, July l5, 2ol9, as noted, the Court heard\npoignant testimony from two of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims about their fears and anxiety over\nhis potential release, even if under strict conditions of home confinement. The Court is also |\nconcerned for new victims.\n\nMr. Epstein’s alleged excessive atraction to sexual conduct with or in the presence of\nminor girls — which is said to include his soliciting and receiving massages from young girls and\nyoung women perhaps as many as four times a day — appears likely to be uncontrollable. See\nUnited States v. Minnici, l28 F. App’x 827, 829-3o (2d Cir. 2oo5) (defendant’s alleged sex\ncrimes were “of an addictive sexual nature that cannot be suppressed simply by a restrictive set\nof bail conditions”). Accordingly, Mr. Epstein’s past sexual conduct is not likely to have abated\nor been successfully suppressed by fierce determination, as his Defense Counsel suggests.\nDefense Counsel contends that: “[H]e wasn’t a predator that couldn’t contro! his conduct. He\ndisciplined himself.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 3l-32. Defense Counsel also argues that “appreciating the\ngravity of these charges . . . puting aside the age of these witnesses and puting the consent issue\naside, it’s not like [Epstein is] an out-of-control rapist.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 36.

Among its\ndeficiencies are these:\n(l) The bail package is not accompanied or supported by audited or certified financial |\nstatements, including details of income and expenses and debt obligations. There is no affidavit |\nfrom Mr. Epstein. As noted, Defense counsel submited a cursory one page “Asset Summary - |\nJune 3o, 2ol9\" on Mr. Epstein’s behalf in which he discloses several categories of assets totaling |\n$559,l2o,954. The Defense states that it “would be impossible for Epstein — given, among other :\n!\nimpediments, his <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, inability to quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly |\nmake a precise valuation of particular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement by the |\nCourt’s 5 pm deadline.” Dkt. 23 at 4. |\nThe absence of accurate and comprehensive financials, sworn to by the Defendant, does |\nnot allou the Court meaningfully to assess Defendants’ oun proposed bail package nor would it |\nenable the Court to fashion a bail package on its oun. The Court would not be able to determine :\nwhat level of bail — in relation to Epstein’s finances ~ would reasonably assure the Defendant’s !\nappearance.

He also suggested that he would do so\n(only) if the Court were agreeable to granting bail. This “offer” appears disingenuous for a\nperson as wealthy and experienced in financial maters as Mr. Epstein. See Tr. 7/l5/l9 at 5o |\n(Court: “There needs to be a fuller financial picture to knou what would be appropriate.”\nDefense Counsel: “Let me be blunt. It was our first effort ....”). That Mr. Epstein does not have\na financial statement, including liabilities and expenses, readily available is difficult to\nunderstand.\n29\n—— DOJ-OGR-ooooo8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000815.jpg": "Cas@’4Sol4-4648o-RME DbeuMenPsH | Piles KV l82 grage82 dF 33\n\nDefendant and their purported role as independent monitors.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000867.jpg": "CaseGa26-2-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRRG6S/22/Phg Page Wof l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3)\n(noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000868.jpg": "CaseGia26-2-ooSB Adin ddd Gumein47lB92 FiRG6S/22/Phg Rage Pof l2\nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense\nspecifically enumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or\ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the\ncommunity or others. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“[A] defendant must\nintroduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).\nNonetheless, “‘the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing\nevidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’” English, 629 F.3d at\n3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”’).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo868\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000869.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRIB6S/22/Phg Rage of l2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000870.jpg": "CaseGa26-2l-oo38 Adin dd Gumein4lB92 FiRNb6S/22/Phag Page of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000871.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRNG6S/22/Phg Rage of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000874.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-oo28 Adin db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/Pag Pegefilof l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000882.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Page6 of 25\n\nDate Filed\n\no6/29/2o2o l | SEALED INDICTMENT as to Sealed Defendant l (l) count(s) l, 2, 3, 4, 5-6.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000949.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36o4AUt Dibeutrenr 2 oPiled OF2GRQoP aeengeot 26oo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000950.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Tibet 2 oPiled OF2GSQoP aeengecs Boo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000951.jpg": "Cage l24 O/CRODBBOHAEN 2OdcUMENt/2o FilecOOAS2o2P aPage of Goo\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“|The steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000952.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBBOHAEN 2OdcUMENt/2o FilecOOAGH2o2 P ahage of aiooo\n\ndate of the amendment,! to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor\nvictim. See United States v.

Pierre-Louis,\nNo. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same). Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo952\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000954.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBROHAGN 2OdtUMENt/2o FilecOOAG2o2 P ahage of Gfooo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo96l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000962.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd B77 POLO Page S| '26oo\n\nBackground. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000963.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page 72cF 26oo\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000966.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAURNDSeuMEeN IE Hied GPAB72o Pagers of 28o\nprior <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-l9. At the time, COVID-\nl9 had only begun to take its devastating toll on New York, and there was no knoun outbreak in\nthe prison population. Nevertheless, the Court noted that “inmates may be at a heightened risk of\ncontracting COVID-l9 should an outbreak develop,” and, based in part on this changed\ncircumstance, ordered the defendant released. /d.\n\nSince the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-l9 risks to inmates have\nincreased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-l9 in correctional\nfacilities.

The Stephens opinion\nprovides yet another independent basis that, we submit, requires Ms. Maxwell’s release: if she is\ndetained, her ability to meet with her atorneys and prepare for her defense will be significantly\nimpaired and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nIn Stephens, the Court found that this factor required the defendant’s release under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(4), which provides for temporary release based on a determination that such\nrelease is “necessary for preparation of the person’s defense.” Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at\n*3. The Court noted that the spread of COVID-l9 had compelled the BOP to suspend all in-\nperson visits, including legal visits, except as alloued on a case-by-case basis. /d. at *3. That\nsuspension persists to this day.* In a case such as this, which will require assessing evidence\nrelating to events that occurred approximately twenty-five years ago, including documents and\npersonal recollections, numerous in-person meetings between counsel and Ms. Maxwell will be\ncritical to the preparation of the defense. The recent resurgence of the pandemic calls into\nquestion whether these meetings will ever be able to happen in advance of her trial.

The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42,\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government .. ..” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64. These factors are not present in this case.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo979\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000981.jpg": "Cds8°F:26-c BOBSSAU AND Se MEAL B Hilal EPAB?2O Pagees9 of 26o\nEB The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance.

Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original).

At the heart of this case are brave women\nwho are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to\nappreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as\nminors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from\nthese events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.\n\nThere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the\njurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.\nFor the reasons detailed in the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memorandum, and as further discussed belou, the\ndefendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her\ncontinued appearance in this case. Among other concerns: (l) she is a citizen of a country that\ndoes not extradite its oun citizens; (2) she appears to have access to considerable wealth\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo986\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000988.jpg": "Cessd 2o-€f Qo36o4AUt Bibeu tet 22o 2Ft il e@ OF ALG) 26a Geadgect 2oo9\n\nFinally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-l9 pandemic is — and should be — a\nrelevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee.

Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000995.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGusnt DOM 2o FilecoOAI3o2P aPage afL2siol9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo995\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000997.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGvsnt DOM 2o FilecoOAI3o2 aPage aB26lol9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368 l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v.

The big fact that the government,\n\n5 Ms. Moe tried to put before you through the victim is that\n\n6 supposedly someone had called in a civil action threatening the\n7 two-year-old child.

And that is the statute, under 3l42(c), says that \"even\n2l the case where there is not to be release ROR\" -- which this is\n22 not that case -- \"the court shall order pretrial release\n23 subject to the least restrictive condition or combination of\n24 conditions.\" That as you nou read, of course, in light of\n25 3l42(e), (f), and (g), the provisions on <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, that the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001058.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagell7 of 2oo Sd\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl MR.

In the reply brief, we get a new allegation that an\n\n8 SDAR, a foreign filing was made in 2ol8 and 2ol9, disclosing\n\n9 that our client had a foreign bank account. Let's stop there.\nlo Our client makes a legally required filing with the Treasury\n\nll Department, obeys the law, and discloses a foreign bank\n\nl2 account, and the government is claiming that's evidence of\n\nl3 hiding.

These are not\n\nl4 factors to be considered in exercising your discretion under\n\nl5 3l42.\n\nl6 Let me turn very quickly to the other two factors that\nl7 are relevant for today's purposes because, as your Honor has\n\nl8 pointed out, the government is not proceeding on a\n\nl9 dangerousness claim. That is the (g)(l) and (g) (2) factors,\n2o the nature and circumstances of the case, and the weight of the\n2l evidence.\n22 Here, I think we -- if you bear with me a moment, your\n23 Honor, here, one thing to keep in mind is an observation\n24 Judge Raggi made in the Sabhnani case, at page 77, where she\n25 said, \"The more effectively a court can physically restrain the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001067.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel26 of 2oo 63\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl defendant, the less important it becomes to identify and\n\n2 restrain each and every asset over which defendants may\n\n3 exercise some control in order to mitigate risk of flight.\" So\n4 if the court -- and we have suggested them, but they may be\n\n5 modified by the court -- can put in place stringent bail\n\n6 conditions, we don't need to have a side-long, month-long\n\n7 hearing about my client's assets which is just designed to keep\n8 her in <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.

Is that the implication you are making?\n\n6 MR. COHEN: No, I am not saying that, your Honor. I\n\n7 am not going that far. What I am saying is, when you have a\n\n8 client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the\n\n9 country despite an investigation, and the government instead\n\nlo chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early\nll instances your access to the client. It is complicated by the\nl2 COVID crisis and the other factors your Honor has pointed out\nl3 in Stephens and in Williams—Bethea, and so it is very hard for\nl4 us to pull together this financial information, and we have\n\nl5 done it as quickly as we could before the court.

COHEN: One last point in that regard, your Honor,\n22 in the schedule we set today -- thank you, your Honor, for\n23 approving that -- the government is saying that it needs at\n24 least until November to complete all discovery, including\n25 electronic discovery. They have told us that there are two\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001078.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel37 of 2oo 74\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was appropriate in that case on risk of flight alone.\n2 And, again, that conduct was -- at that point significant time\n3 had passed, and Jeffrey Epstein was not a foreign citizen.\n\n4 I want to respond with respect to the NPA. At this\n\n5 point, your Honor, the defense has articulated no legal basis\n\n6 to suggest that the defendant is shielded by the nonprosecution\n7 agreement, and it simoly doesn't make sense that the decision\n\n8 in this case is somehou tactical to avoid concerns about the\n\n9 NPA, when the government charged Jeffrey Epstein with conduct\nlo that fell within the scope of the time period within the\n\nll nonprosecution agreement and stated before the court in\n\nl2 connection with bail proceedings in that mater that this is\n\nl3 the government's strong view that that agreement does not bind\nl4 this office whatsoever with respect to any kind of conduct or\nl5 any kind of individual. That agreement does not bind this\n\nl6 office whatsoever.\n\nl7 Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to\nl8 evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the\n\nl9 circumstances.

A finding of dangerousness, if\n\n9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing\nlo evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be\nll supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nl2 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is\n\nl3 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal\nl4 law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or\n\nl5 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance\nl6 of the person as required. That's citing l8 U.S.C. 3l42(a) (3).\nl7 The Second Circuit has explained that, ina\n\nl8 presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a Limited\n\nl9 burden of production, not a burden of persuasion, to rebut the\n2o presumption by coming forward with evidence that she does not\nal pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.\n22 Furthermore, once a defendant has met her burden of production\n23 relating to these two factors, the presumption favoring\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to\n25 be considered among those weighed by the district court.

As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.

For example, the risk of flight in Esposito appears to\nl4 have been based on the resources available to defendant, not\n\nl5 foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from\nl6 being found.\n\nl7 In Madoff, the defendant had already been released on\nl8 a bail package agreed to by the parties for a considerable\n\nl9 period of time before the government sought <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The\n2o court there found there were no circumstances in the\nal intervening period shouing that the defendant had become a\n22 flight risk. Because of these crucial factual differences, the\n23 court finds the cases not on point and not persuasive.\n24 Finally, in arguing for release, the defense raises\n25 the challenges and risks posed by the COVID-l9 pandemic.

The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several\na reasons. Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in\n\n6 which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-l9,\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health\n\n8 conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk\n\n9 from the virus.

The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n* Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84):\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “\\clircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83): and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\nreasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\nairest and her initial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing.

She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\ndemonstrate Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v.

Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001138.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt Dibeutre/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedge 42 2o45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.\"\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel.

In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001150.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNE n Die GMeholooo Aled 425o8) 26a Ragef 8 Ob 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001151.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo 8B G+ANEt DOEUMEr? loo2 Filed6R248/7thgPageb l636\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial.

When seeking <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> analysis when the Government\nseeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . .

The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001154.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdNt n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 adedgeci A Ob 36\ndefendant faces up to 35 years of incarceration, and may very well spend the remainder of her\nnatural life in prison. The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001157.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8)26adedGecl 5 Ob 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001158.jpg": "CaSede2ot er-OoF3ZocAdNt n DiteGmeholooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect 6 Gb 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001164.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck A Ob 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001166.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deagec? 4 Ob 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001167.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeaGeck 5 Ob 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was still warranted. (See Tr. 87).\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001168.jpg": "CaSede2ot er-OoF3ZocAdNt n DiteGmMeholooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rageck 6 Gb 36\nthis Court already weighed in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and confirmation of that deception only\nreemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions.\n\nNou, the defense has submited a financial report that reflects the defendant has\napproximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial\nServices. (Def. Ex. O). Accepting the financial report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. In\nother words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would\nstill have millions of dollars at her disposal. She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access. The financial report only addresses the\ndefendant’s assets without detailing her income at all. The defendant has similarly provided the\nCourt with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective\n® In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in\nunrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other\nitems. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the\nretainer paid to her atorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled.\n\n7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents\nof the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond\namount. These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as\na result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001170.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deaGeck 8 Ob 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001171.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAdNt n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck I Ob 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F.

Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, weighing\nfurther in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001176.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagpecd 4 Ob 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001211.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBRGuIAnt DOciunef ll86 2 Filee6BaSo/ Page agehilGh22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“|A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”). Nonetheless, “‘the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001213.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DOciNe rt l/86 2 FileebBaSO/RagP ageheh22\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’”” English, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting\nMercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986)\n(“The government retains the burden of persuasion |in a presumption case].”). Even when “a\ndefendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does\nnot disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district\ncourt.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o 9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail\nhearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and\nthat has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(f). But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “|a|s the court has already held one <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v.

Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing because the\nnew information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant until trial).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001214.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DOciuMe rt l/26 2 FileebBaSO/ Rage agebl6h22\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other\nperson and the community.” A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”’); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001215.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRO DOciuINe rt l/26 2 FileebBaASO/RagP a4 @6l6h22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services. Jd. at 2 3.\nFurthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who\nwould prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or\nPretrial Services and who would escort her when she is authorized to leave. Jd. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law enforcement prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25—29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001216.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGusnt DOctind o l/86 2 Filee6BaSo/ Page Agef7l6h22\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001217.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGNnt DOctina rf ll26 2 Filee6Ba3o/PagP ageBblGk22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001218.jpg": "Casast:2o-cr/ooBa@AuRnt B6cunde rt l/862 FileesRaSo/PtagPAgeblGh22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001219.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a dea Geold G6 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001222.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geageol 3 G5 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001224.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocA one n Lee Gmeh/ol o4o 2F il @ 4223o) 26a geagfeol 5 G5 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001225.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 42243o) 26a geageol 6 Gb 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nC. Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001228.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Deke Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a geageol J G6 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool228\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001229.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeh'olo4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a deageo? d G6 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they\nare not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the Court.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001230.jpg": "CaSade2ter MW I3oca one n Lee Gmeh'ol o4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a GeaGec? l Gb 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force.

The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001240.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCute/ntl l6o2 lF ited 82728 /2 49 Pagel d Ob 9\nassure her appearance as required.

The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001246.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePage@ 4 l69\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001247.jpg": "Caseel24 o/o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001249.jpg": "Caseel24 o/7o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePag ef lG\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001262.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd33ouAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3ie/2agPiagecs 66l8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001263.jpg": "Cased 2o-C€rOd33ouAUNt DibCutent l7o2 lFiRGSSe/Raghiages o6l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court.

Ms. Maxwell’s continued\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001277.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF iO 837222/24gPFlaGeot o642\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y.

In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001280.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutrent l682 lFiKOS3222/2agAaGeor o642\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001281.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF ib 837222/2agFidgec’ o642\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001284.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G AUN D6cuMen?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ll6l5l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001288.jpg": "Caseel27 o/o o8BoHAEN 2ADdtuUMAEht /L59 l Filecsad 672g ePagePl6k3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied. In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily\nnewspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP\nsystem, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool288\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001289.jpg": "Caseel22 o/o o8BOHAEN ADE uUMAEht /L52 l Filecsad 6729 ePageBlGks\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2. Extensive pretrial litigation folloued until the\ncase was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2o2o. Doc. 63. The Court held a pretrial\nconference on March lo, 2o2o and testimonial writs were issued. Docs. l27 and l43. Just days\nlater, houever, the devastating extent of the global COVID-l9 pandemic became clear and the\nChief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil\nand criminal jury trials set for the follouing month. See In the Mater of: Court Operations in\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool292\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001293.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Filee662o6/PhgPage F 66D\nLight of the Coronavirus Outbreak, 2o-MC-oooo4-9 (D.N.M.

See Jn the\nMater of: Superseding Administrative Order 2o-MC-oooo4-49, 2l-MC-oooo4-o4 (D.N.M. Jan.\nl5, 2o2l) (Johnson, C.J.) (continuing the suspension of all civil and criminal jury trials through at\nleast February 28, 2o2l).\n\nIn the intervening ll months, Mr. Robertson has remained in custody. During that time\nperiod, the Court set and then continued several trial dates due to the pandemic, including dates in\nDecember 2o2o and February 2o2l. See, e.g, Doc. 27l. Mr. Robertson’s trial will nou be reset\nfor April 5, 2o2l, and the Court is hopeful that he will finally get his day in court after the extreme\nand unprecedented delay he has endured. Complicating maters, houever, is the fact that the\npandemic and the resulting passage of time has led to a recent and significant change in Mr.\nRobertson’s defense team: both of his original atorneys withdrew from the case in January of this\nyear. Doc. 295. As a result, the atorneys with which he will be going to trial in two months were\nappointed in September 2o2o and January 2o2l. Docs. l97 and 293. Although the Court would\nnot have granted the appointments if it were not sure that Mr. Robertson’s new atorneys would be\nready for trial this April, they nevertheless face the daunting task of earning their client’s trust,\npreparing for trial, and reviewing three years’ worth of litigation in a mater of months.\n\nMr. Robertson first asked the Court to consider his release in July of last year. Doc. l8l.\nHe argued that his continued pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> posed a risk to his health because his compromised\nimmune system makes him especially vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-l9. Id.\nat 5. He also argued that there were conditions of release that would satisfy the requirements of\nthe Bail Reform Act, including the designation of his father as a third-party custodian. /d. at 9-\nlo. The Court took up the motion at a status conference held on September ll, 2o2o. It explained\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001296.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivent Documdil B62 Fileeh662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool296\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001297.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye of 6656\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001301.jpg": "Cass :27-CrO2o48 UMM nIDechMehD3OW 2FileoO2l66/A2adedge bi HFl6\ncombination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the community. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001302.jpg": "Cass :27-Cr-O2o48 UMM nIDechmMehO3SO@) 2Fileo O2l66/Atadedge b? HI6\nComplicating maters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense atorneys have\nrecently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current atorneys have been appointed within\nthe past six months (one in the last three weeks). The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001305.jpg": "Casse :27-Cr-O29o48uMen(DbcanehO3O 2Filee O2Io6/Alagedge o5 F5l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\nunavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\naccommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”). Second, the Court does not agree that the government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001320.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page3 of 25\n\nher bail application (Ex.

In addition to the original six charges, the Superseding Indictment also\ncharges Maxwell with sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nand sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Among other things,\nthe Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three from l994 through 2oo4 and specifically identified a fourth\nvictim of those conspiracies.

Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s\nargument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere\nwith her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).\nMaxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other\ninmates at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as\nmuch, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). Judge Nathan\nreiterated that she would continue to ensure that Maxwell is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o\nn.3).\n\nD. = The Third Bail Application\n\n23. On February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed a third bail application,\n\nproposing two additional bail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001330.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel3 of 25\ncitizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new\naccount to be overseen by a monitor. (Ex. I). After considering multiple writen\nsubmissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another writen\nopinion. (Ex. L).\n\n24. Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted\nin light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7).\n\n25. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument that the strength of\nthe evidence was diminished by Maxwell’s pending pre-trial motions. (/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll).

Judge Nathan did not clearly err when she determined that\nMaxwell is a risk of flight and that no conditions would reasonably assure her\nappearance in court. Nor did Judge Nathan abuse her discretion or clearly err by\ndenying Maxwell’s request for temporary release.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n28. In seeking pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Government bears the burden\nof shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure\nher presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d\n63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\n29. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In\nsuch a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of\npersuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001333.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel6 of 25\nCir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the\nstatutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it\nbecomes a factor to be weighed and considered in deciding whether release is\nwarranted. /d.\n\n3o. Where the Government seeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n3l. This Court generally applies “deferential review to a district\ncourt’s order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir.\n2ol9). It reviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight\nand whether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll);\nUnited States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. l987), and will reverse only if\n“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been commited,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n32. Once a defendant has been ordered detained, a judicial officer\nmay “permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States\nmarshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001334.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel7 of 25\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l). The defendant bears the burden\nof shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough,\n82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No. 2o Cr. l26\n(LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o). This Court has not\nresolved whether it reviews a district court’s temporary release decision for abuse of\ndiscretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852, 853 n.3\n(2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nl. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Bail\n\n33. Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001335.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel8 of 25\ninternational ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections\nabroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value, lack of candor\nabout her finances, and “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex. D at 79-\n9l; Ex. H at 7-2o; Ex. L at 6-ll). Maxwell does not come close to identifying clear\nerror.\n\n34. Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue\nreliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. l9-\n2l). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine,\n2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not\nsubstitutes for trial or even for discovery. Often the opposing parties simply describe\nto the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce it.”\nId.; see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, l49 F.\nApp’x 4o, 42-43 (2d Cir. 2oo5); United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9, 32l n.7\n(2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Vondete, 5 F. App’x 73, 76 (2d Cir. 2ool); Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll45.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001337.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001338.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2l of 25\n\n38. At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications. V/d. at 2o n.3). Judge Nathan continued to oversee\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooool338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001340.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page23 of 25\nfive hours of video-teleconference calls with her counsel every weekday. (Gov’t Ex.\nA at l8).\n\n4o. Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” United States v. Chambers, No. 2o Cr. l35 (JMF),\n2o2o WL l53o746, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o). Here, that balance emphatically\nfavors <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, given Judge Nathan’s repeated findings about risk of flight and the\nsubstantial accommodations made to ensure Maxwell’s ability to prepare her\ndefense.\n\n4l. The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this conclusion.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex. D at 89-9o; Ex. H at 2l), but she nou\nhas been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at l9, 2l). And while some district courts\nhave ordered temporary release based in part on the COVID-l9 pandemic, each of\nthese discretionary decisions rests on its particular facts, as Judge Nathan was well-\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooool34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001343.jpg": ".

(Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001345.jpg": ".

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001346.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/oo8aGAU Ant BGeumMent 72o Fileaov2/o4R o aPage kart 2\nPage 2\nsearching (e.g., weekly body scan, l5-minute interval flashlight checks at night, and open-mouth\ninspection) despite being surveilled 24/7 by a dedicated three-guard security detail and two\ncameras; and the reason she is not being moved to the day room, which we understood was the\noriginal plan (and would reduce searching).

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001355.jpg": "_ Caesesb:2o-cl/ oo88o4o st BOcument 4/29 2 Filed/o27/o4/PagPage fat 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001357.jpg": "_ _Casesb:2o-cr/ oo 88olANNnt BOctIMent 28.2 Filed/G2/o5/PagPage tlt 2\noe U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. No. 92). Over the past two months, the\nGovernment has had multiple communications with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal counsel through those communications.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC’s mail room, where every piece of mail is processed\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001359.jpg": "_ Casesb:2o-cr/ oo B8tlANNNt BOcuMEnt 2962 Filed/O4/o6/PagPage taf 6\noe U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

The government’s April l2\" disclosure of information and statements\nregarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.\nThe delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial\nseverely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.\n\nTo assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list of trial witnesses, its\nalleged FRE 4o4(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance. In reliance on the firm trial\ndate set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July l4%, 2o2o, counsel prioritized the\nJuly l2, 2o2l trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid interference.

As guards\nexplained to Ms. Maxwell, there are three drains in the day area, and when the plumbing system\ngoes unused, gases escape from the drains and cause the stench. At times the stench in Ms.\nMaxwell’s isolation cell has been overwhelming due to overflouing of toilets in the cellblock\nabove. Due to lack of privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from using the toilet in the isolation cell\nand, as directed by the guards, she flushes frequently to avoid plumbing problems.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001440.jpg": "Cases: 2o-cr/oo8BG+AN Nt D6cuMent B222 Filedoos/O7/PagPage Bsr 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

There can be no doubt that the MDC was follouing\ndirectives from Atorney General William Barr and the Director of the BOP in determining that\nMs. Maxwell should not be placed in general population, not Ms. Maxwell. Regardless, the\nMDC would never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in general\npopulation, knouing the difficulties it would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from assault and\nextortion by other inmates given that they do not protect her from physical abuse by guards.

As the Government has explained in oral and writen proffers,\nthe allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of\nthree different victim-witnesses. (See, e.g., Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-lo). Each\nvictim-witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-\nwitnesses, but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence,\nincluding flight records, diary entries, and other evidence. (See Ex. A at 5; Ex. F\nat lo-l2).\n\nll. Maxwell has made three separate bail applications to the District\nCourt, each of which was thoroughly briefed. Judge Nathan denied all three\napplications in careful and thorough decisions.\n\nl2. First, after receiving extensive writen submissions from the\nparties (Ex. A, B, C), Judge Nathan held a bail hearing on July l4, 2o2o, at which\nshe heard lengthy oral argument and received statements from two victims. Judge\nNathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis of risk of flight and\nexplained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling. (Ex. D at 79-9l). In reaching\nthis decision, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense\nhere weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>” (id. at 82), “[t]he government’s evidence at this\nearly juncture of the case appears strong” (id.), and Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight (id. at 83).

In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

It should be denied.\nA. Applicable Law\n\n23. When seeking pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Government bears the\nburden of shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a\nrisk of flight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably\nassure her presence in court.

Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. 8§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required....” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).\nIn such a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden\nof persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose .. . a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436\n(2d Cir. 2ool).\n\n25. Where the Government seeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001454.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel4 of 24\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n26. This Court applies “deferential review to a district court’s order\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It\nreviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight and\nwhether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll);\nUnited States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. l987), and will reverse only if\n“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been commited,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n27. Once a defendant has been ordered detained, a judicial officer\nmay “permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States\nmarshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).. The defendant bears the\nburden of shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v.\nScarborough, 82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No.\n2o Cr. l26 (LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o).

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 4of lo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release.

Evidentiary rules do not apply at <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool49l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 6of lo\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“[T]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government .. . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 _ Filed o7/o2/2o Page 7 of lo\ndate of the amendment, to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor\nvictim. See United States v. Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because\nCongress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the\nprevious statute was still running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis,\nNo. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same). Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 9 of lo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe defendant was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire on the charges contained in the above-\ncaptioned Indictment and presented before a United States Magistrate Judge in the District of New\nHampshire. At that appearance, the defendant waived her right to an identity hearing, consented\nto <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without prejudice to making a later application for bail, and consented to her transfer\nto the Southern District of New York.\n\nWhile the Government has no control over the timing of the defendant’s transport, the\nGovernment understands from the United States Marshals Service (“USMS”) that the USMS is\nacting expeditiously to transport the defendant into this District. In particular, the Government\nunderstands that the USMS expects that the defendant will arrive in this District early this week,\nwell within the ten days contemplated by the Speedy Trial Act for transfer of a defendant from\nanother district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F).\n\nThe Government has consulted with defense counsel, Christian Everdell, Esq., who has\nrequested that the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this mater take place on July\nlo, 2o2o. In advance of that proceeding, the parties jointly request that the defense be permited\nto file a writen bail application to the Court by 3:oo p.m. on July 9, 2o2o, and that the Government\nbe permited to file a writen reply by l2:oo p.m. on July lo, 2o2o. If that schedule is acceptable\nto the Court, the parties respectfully request that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial\nappearance, and bail hearing in this mater for the afternoon of July lo, 2o2o.\n\nAdditionally, the Government respectfully requests that the Court exclude time under the\nSpeedy Trial Act between the defendant’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o and the date of the arraignment,\ninitial appearance, and bail hearing before Your Honor.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 6 of 26\n\nBackground. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 7 of 26\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page lo of 26\nprior <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-l9. At the time, COVID-\nl9 had only begun to take its devastating toll on New York, and there was no knoun outbreak in\nthe prison population. Nevertheless, the Court noted that “inmates may be at a heightened risk of\ncontracting COVID-l9 should an outbreak develop,” and, based in part on this changed\ncircumstance, ordered the defendant released. /d.\n\nSince the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-l9 risks to inmates have\nincreased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-l9 in correctional\nfacilities. In the last month alone, the number of prison inmates knoun to have COVID-l9 has\ndoubled to 68,ooo, and prison deaths tied to COVID-l9 have increased by 73 percent.' Indeed,\nas of July 2, 2o2o, nine of the ten largest knoun clusters of the coronavirus in the United States\nare in federal prisons and county jails.” As this Court noted last month, “the ‘inability [of]\nindividuals to socially distance, shared communal spaces, and limited access to hygiene\nproducts’ [in correctional facilities] make community spread all but unavoidable.” United States\nv.

The risks are further enhanced by the possibility\nof a second wave of coronavirus cases.°\n\nIn particular, COVID-l9 has begun to spread through the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center\n(MDC), where Ms. Maxwell has been housed since the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred her\nthere on July 6, 2o2o.

The Stephens opinion\nprovides yet another independent basis that, we submit, requires Ms. Maxwell’s release: if she is\ndetained, her ability to meet with her atorneys and prepare for her defense will be significantly\nimpaired and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nIn Stephens, the Court found that this factor required the defendant’s release under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42), which provides for temporary release based on a determination that such\nrelease is “necessary for preparation of the person’s defense.” Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at\n*3.

The recent resurgence of the pandemic calls into\nquestion whether these meetings will ever be able to happen in advance of her trial.

The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42.\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shail order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive .. . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n* See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose. . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

The government asserts that\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion. '*\n\n“ The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F.

At the heart of this case are brave women\nwho are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to\nappreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as\nminors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from\nthese events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.\n\nThere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the\njurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.\nFor the reasons detailed in the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memorandum, and as further discussed belou, the\ndefendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her\ncontinued appearance in this case. Among other concerns: (l) she is a citizen of a country that\ndoes not extradite its oun citizens; (2) she appears to have access to considerable wealth\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 4 of l9\n\nFinally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-l9 pandemic is — and should be — a\nrelevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001621.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page ll of l9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l3 of l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nThe defendant has no children in the United States, she does not reside with any immediate\nfamily members, and while the Government does not dispute that she is close with several of her\nsiblings, as her time in hiding makes clear, she is clearly capable of maintaining those relationships\nremotely, which of course she could continue to do from abroad.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.)

As reported by Bloomberg,\nMr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all\nin violation of subsections (l), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule:\n\nThat’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who\n\nrepresents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused\n\nby Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her\ncredibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.\n\n‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying\n\nto blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so\n\ncontrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just\n\ngoing to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were\nrepresenting her.’\n\nBoies said he was confident Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if\n\nthere’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not\n\nto grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused\n\nme.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies\n\nsaid that Farmer was a l6-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met\n\nMaxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group\n\nof high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said.\n\n‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are\n\nfraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.”®\n\n® htps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghislaine-maxwell-may-play-the-victim-card-in-trial-\ndefense-l.l46563l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 27 Filed o7/2l/2o Page 6 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

For these reasons, we\nrespectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order.\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nWe also seek the Court’s assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\nat the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”), and her access to the discovery in this case, so\nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein’s body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to\nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom\ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms.\nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense\ncounsel. Until recently, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch protocols, including being\nwoken up every few hours during the night and being forced to wear special clothing, despite the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 5 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to\nundergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s access to the standard prison\nresources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively\ncurtailed or eliminated altogether.\n\nThis treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to participate in her\ndefense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms.\nMaxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes\non them, and to discuss them with her atorneys. But there currently is no such structure in\nplace.

For these reasons, we\nrespectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order.\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nWe also seek the Court’s assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\nat the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”), and her access to the discovery in this case, so\nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein’s body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to\nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom\ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms.\nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense\ncounsel. Until recently, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch protocols, including being\nwoken up every few hours during the night and being forced to wear special clothing, despite the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 86 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 5 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\nfact that she, unlike Mr. Epstein, has never been suicidal and was never diagnosed as exhibiting\nrisk factors for suicide. Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to\nundergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s access to the standard prison\nresources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively\ncurtailed or eliminated altogether.\n\nThis treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to participate in her\ndefense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms.\nMaxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes\non them, and to discuss them with her atorneys. But there currently is no such structure in\nplace. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard\ndrive containing the discovery in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing\nthe first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDefense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a\nprocedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review discovery\nmaterials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell.

Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 5 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 5\ncame from another state, agents, or lawyers. In addition, the Government has disclosed the\nexistence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from\nthe United States Atorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States\nAtomey’s Georgia office.\n\nIt is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand\nthe Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant disclosure in\nthis case.” On the other hand, the Government’s leter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why\nthe Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the discovery. The\nauthority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case\ndoes not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp.\n3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO),\n2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,\n4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“NYSE”).\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this\nargument will be held on another day. It is troubling, houever, that instead of simply providing\nthe information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.\nMs. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery Plan is Inadequate and\nPrejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing, to a trial more than one year\nfrom her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with\nfull discovery no later than November 9, 2o2o. See ECF #25, “Completion of Discovery to\ninclude electronic materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2o2o.” This representation nou\nseems incorrect. The Government, in its leter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why\nthe completion of discovery will likely not occur by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nMs. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2o2l, outside the time limits established by\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l6l, thought that she would be provided with meaningful discovery with sufficient\ntime to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its leter to the Court the Government\nproposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important\nwitnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old\nclaims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material\nwitnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New\nYork. Securing out-of-country testimony is difficult even where a defendant has been provided\nwith the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and\nconferred about the timing of disclosure of witness statements, so it is premature to discuss these\nissues with the Court. We note, houever, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it\nwill be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nThe Government’s suggested timeline also impairs Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively\naddress significant legal issues including motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 7 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 7\n\nThe BOP, for their part, has only exacerbated these problems. For example, on a legal\nvisit today to review images on a laptop computer provided by the Government, we were told\nthat we could not sit on the same side of the table as Ms. Maxwell to review the images\nsimultaneously. Instead, we were directed by MDC prison guards to sit across from Ms.\nMaxwell, such that we could not see what she was reviewing or meaningfully discuss the\nmaterials.\n\nTo compound the problem, we were told by the team leader that defense counsel would\nnot be permited to pass Ms. Maxwell papers for her to review or sign. This required a break in\nthe meeting so that defense counsel could call the prosecutors to intervene. The prosecutors\nagreed to call the MDC to ensure that defense counsel could pass legal papers to Ms. Maxwell.\nBut that message was clearly not received by the MDC. After returning to the MDC, we were\ntold that we could pass Ms. Maxwell only documents that required her signature, but not\ndocuments that needed her review. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to participate in her defense\nand adequately prepare for trial if she cannot review documents prepared by her atorneys.\nAccordingly, we ask the Court to order the BOP to allou defense counsel to pass legal papers to\nMs. Maxwell for her review during prison visits.\n\nThe Government cannot discharge its discovery obligations by partially completing them.\nThe Government must fully complete them and do so on the deadlines they agreed to with the\nCourt. And it goes without saying that the Government cannot discharge its discovery\nobligations by producing the discovery to defense counsel. Ms. Maxwell has a right to review all\nthe discovery to participate in her oun defense. As such, she must have a complete set of\nreadable discovery in the MDC, which she does not have. The Government has created these\nproblems by insisting on <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> prior to trial. It is their burden to fix them.\n\nThe Government has not requested any relief in its leter of October 7, 2o2o. Ms.\nMaxwell anticipates that once the Government responds to her discovery requests and after\nfurther conferrals the parties will be in a beter position to seek relief from the Court. It may be\nappropriate for the Court to schedule a status conference after November 9 to consider these\nissues.\n\nRespectfully Submited,\nJeffr¢y S.

For all of its innuendo and\naccusations, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 discovery to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of electronic discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\nelectronic discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule l6\ndiscovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law.

Accordingly, the parties have been\nunable to reach agreement on the requested two-week extension of the deadline for the Production.\n4, I hereby certify that the foregoing statements made by me are true.\nDated: New York, New York\nNovember 6, 2o2o\nMaurene Comey .\nAssistant United States Atorney\nTelephone: (2l2) 637-2324\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool823\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62 Filed ll/o8/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide an update regarding the\ndefendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) pursuant to\nthe Court’s Order dated August 25, 2o2o. (Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 75 Filed ll/24/2o Page l of 2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a Renewed Motion for\nRelease on Bail (the “Motion”) and respectfully request an in camera conference, with all\ncounsel present, to address the appropriate procedures for the filing and consideration of the\nMotion. For the reasons explained belou, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crm. P.\n49.l(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting\nmaterials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an\nin camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other\nconfidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the\ngovernment, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting\nthat sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those\nthat the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case.\n\nIn the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request for bail and granted the\ngovernment’s motion for <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial\ninformation that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive\nbail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly,\nMs. Maxwell nou seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s renewed application will rely on sensitive and private information that, if\nmade public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including:\n\n¢ Leters from Ms. Maxwell’s family members and close friends, who have agreed to\n\nserve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application.

Our immediate goal is to rectify these\nproblems and improve the extraordinarily restrictive conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is\npresently confined within your facility.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Honorable Alison J. Nathan entered an order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nremanding Ghislaine Maxwell to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. She has been detained\nsince her arrest on July 2, 2o2o and has been incarcerated at MDC under conditions that rival\nthose at USP Florence ADMAX. An exemplary inmate who poses no threat to her personal\nsafety or danger to anyone, she has spent the entirety of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in de facto solitary\nconfinement, tantamount to imprisonment as a defendant convicted of capital murder and\nincarcerated on death rou. The conditions of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> are uterly inappropriate, especially so\nfor a non-violent defendant with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a quarter-\ncentury old.\n\nWithout a doubt, the BOP has imposed extraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint\non Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic consequences of negligence occurring at the\nMetropolitan Correctional Center (MCC- Manhatan) which resulted in the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein. The Atorney General of the United States has said as much. The BOP has admited\nthat the sanctions are not in response to a specific threat that Ms. Maxwell has shoun; rather they\nare in response to the high-profile nature of the case and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to\nkeep Epstein — an actual threat to himself — alive. Ms. Maxwell is bearing the brunt of\nincompetence on MCC’s watch. As ABC News reported:\n\n' Previous leters were sent to you on August 28, 2o2o and September 9, 2o2o.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 6 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nAtorney General William Barr told ABC News on Wednesday that he is keeping a close\n\nwatch to make sure that Maxwell makes it to trial after Epstein died by suicide in a\n\nManhatan jail while awaiting trial last year. Barr said he was \"/ivid\" Epstein died while\n\nin custody last August. The investigation into Epstein has continued even after his death.\n\n\"I believe very strongly in that case,\" Barr told ABC News on Wednesday. \"And I was\n\nvery proud of the work done by the department, the Southern District [of New York], on\n\nthat case. And as you will recall, after he commited suicide, I said that I was confident\nthat we would continue to pursue this case vigorously and pursue anyone who's complicit\nin it. And so I'm very happy that we were able to get Ms. Maxwell.” A source said the\n\nBOP is taking extra preventative measures to regain the public's trust and confidence as\n\nwell as preserving the integrity of the Justice Department.”\n\nWhat is clear is that the Government is “livid” over the death of Epstein and is seeking to\nrepair its reputation by placing Ms. Maxwell under extraordinarily harsh conditions; not in any\nresponse to Ms. Maxwell’s requirements, but rather in response to the failed handling of a\ncompletely different defendant.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been an exemplary detainee who has never received a disciplinary\ndemerit. The purpose of this leter is not simply to express complaint due to the institutional\nviolations and denial of rights suffered by Ms. Maxwell in relation to her pretrial incarceration.\nRather, it seeks to bring an unwarranted situation to your atention - conditions that are unduly\ncruel and punitive and circumstances that are deleteriously impacting our client’s ability to\nprepare her defense which, in turn, interferes with our ability to provide the legal representation\nto which she, and any other detainee, deserves.\n\nWe continue our ongoing atempt to resolve these maters without court intervention. We\nhave voiced complaint through the MDC Legal Department, your office, the AUSAs in charge\nof this case, and the Federal Defenders of New York.* Ms. Maxwell has atempted to resolve\nthese maters by follouing the internal prison procedures, filing writen complaints to her unit\ncounselor (BP8), to the warden (BP9), and to the regional office (BP lo), to seek remediation as\nset forth in the BOP manuals and inmate handbook. All to no avail.\n\nDraconian Conditions of Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\n\nMs. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement are extraordinarily onerous - and unlike those\nof any other inmate at the MDC (or in BOP custody, to our knouledge). In fact, in the time that\nMs. Maxwell has been at the MDC, she has met with five separate wardens and interim wardens,\nmany who have remarked that they have never seen in their collective years of experience\n* See, “Ghislaine Maxwell given paper clothes at correctional center to avoid suicide atempt: Sources\nJeffrey Epstein, her associate, died by suicide in jail last August.”’ btps://abcnews.go.com/US/ghislaine-\nmaxwell-paper-clothes-correctional-center-avoid-suicide/story?id=7l699ooo (emphasis added).\n> The Federal Defenders of New York has been tasked with scheduling of atorney-client communication\nin connection with ongoing litigation against the MDC based on conditions of confinement during\nCOVID pending in the Eastern District of New York before the Honorable Margo K.

STERNHEIAA\nanything like her current regime.* The follouing conditions and circumstances of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,\nindividually and collectively, compromise her opportunity to confer with counsel and prepare her\ndefense for trial and are detrimental to her physical health and psychological well-being:\n\nDe Facto Solitary Confinement: Ms. Maxwell is the sole inmate in a housing unit. By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Unit lo South, aka “the terrorist SHU”. In\naddition, counsel is Curcio counsel for a client authorized for the death penalty who is in general\npopulation at the MCC. Having visited BOP facilities during the past 35 years and representing clients\ncharged with the most heinous and violent crimes of murder, counsel had never had a client subjected to\nsuch punitive conditions of pretrial (or post-conviction) incarceration as in the present case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 9 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 8 of 9l 8\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl arranged for a live video feed of this proceeding to be set up\n2 in the jury assembly room at the courthouse.

The big fact that the government,\n\n5 Ms. Moe tried to put before you through the victim is that\n\n6 supposedly someone had called in a civil action threatening the\n7 two-year-old child.

That is not -—- other than the fact\n22 that it's an indicted charge, they are still entitled to the\n23 weight the court would give a not indicted charge.

In the reply brief, we get a new allegation that an\n\n8 SDAR, a foreign filing was made in 2ol8 and 2ol9, disclosing\n\n9 that our client had a foreign bank account. Let's stop there.\nlo Our client makes a legally required filing with the Treasury\n\nll Department, obeys the law, and discloses a foreign bank\n\nl2 account, and the government is claiming that's evidence of\n\nl3 hiding.

That is the (g)(l) and (g) (2) factors,\n2o the nature and circumstances of the case, and the weight of the\nal evidence.\n22 Here, I think we -- if you bear with me a moment, your\n23 Honor, here, one thing to keep in mind is an observation\n24 Judge Raggi made in the Sabhnani case, at page 77, where she\n25 said, \"The more effectively a court can physically restrain the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool939\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 63 of 9l 63\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl defendant, the less important it becomes to identify and\n\n2 restrain each and every asset over which defendants may\n\n3 exercise some control in order to mitigate risk of flight.\" So\n4 if the court -- and we have suggested them, but they may be\n\n5 modified by the court -- can put in place stringent bail\n\n6 conditions, we don't need to have a side-long, month-long\n\n7 hearing about my client's assets which is just designed to keep\n8 her in <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.

This\nl3 is a bail hearing. It is not the place to litigate complex\n\nl4 legal questions that we will be presenting to your Honor. It's\nl5 very soon on the motion schedule, and we thank the court for\n\nl6 agreeing to the schedule. But there are a few things that are\nl7 worth pointing out.\n\nl8 We believe there are very significant motions here\n\nl9 that will affect whether this indictment survives at all or the\n2o shape of this indictment and, given the government's\n2l representation that it is not planning to supersede, will\n22 affect the shape of the entire case, or any case at all that\n23 proceeds before the court at trial, if there is a trial. That\n24 is exactly what we submit the court can consider, again, in\n25 exercising its discretion as to the weight of the evidence.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool94o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 66 of 9l 66\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl MR.

Is that the implication you are making?\n\n6 MR. COHEN: No, I am not saying that, your Honor. I\n\n7 am not going that far. What I am saying is, when you have a\n\n8 client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the\n\n9 country despite an investigation, and the government instead\n\nlo chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early\nll instances your access to the client. It is complicated by the\nl2 COVID crisis and the other factors your Honor has pointed out\nl3 in Stephens and in Williams-—Bethea, and so it is very hard for\nl4 us to pull together this financial information, and we have\n\nl5 done it as quickly as we could before the court. But the\n\nl6 notion that my client should have been able to answer off the\nl7 top of her head the questions from Pretrial Services about a\n\nl8 real estate transaction, for example, just doesn't make any\n\nl9 sense. That's the point we are making.\n2o THE COURT: Okay.\n2l MR. COHEN: One last point in that regard, your Honor,\n22 in the schedule we set today -- thank you, your Honor, for\n23 approving that -- the government is saying that it needs at\n24 least until November to complete all discovery, including\n25 electronic discovery. They have told us that there are two\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 74 of 9l 74\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was appropriate in that case on risk of flight alone.\n2 And, again, that conduct was -- at that point significant time\n3 had passed, and Jeffrey Epstein was not a foreign citizen.\n\n4 I want to respond with respect to the NPA. At this\n\n5 point, your Honor, the defense has articulated no legal basis\n\n6 to suggest that the defendant is shielded by the nonprosecution\n7 agreement, and it simoly doesn't make sense that the decision\n\n8 in this case is somehou tactical to avoid concerns about the\n\n9 NPA, when the government charged Jeffrey Epstein with conduct\nlo that fell within the scope of the time period within the\n\nll nonprosecution agreement and stated before the court in\n\nl2 connection with bail proceedings in that mater that this is\n\nl3 the government's strong view that that agreement does not bind\nl4 this office whatsoever with respect to any kind of conduct or\nl5 any kind of individual. That agreement does not bind this\n\nl6 office whatsoever.\n\nl7 Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to\nl8 evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the\n\nl9 circumstances. The defense's argument, in essence, atempts to\n2o view each of the government's arguments as absolute. But when\n2l you review the totality of the circumstances -- the defendant's\n22 extensive international ties, her conduct over the past year,\n23 her unknoun finances and unwillingness to be more candid with\n24 the court about her resources to flee, her specific bail\n25 proposal which provides absolutely no security to the court --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool95l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 75 of 9l 75\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl it is clear that defendant has not met her burden to rebut the\n2 presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case.

Do you dispute anything legally\n\nl7 suggested by Mr. Cohen in terms of the standard that applies?\nl8 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government submits that the\nl9 standard is clear. It is the defendant's burden of production\n2o to rebut the presumption that there are no set of conditions\nal that could reasonably assure her continued appearance in this\n22 case. The government has the ultimate burden of persuasion,\n23 but it is the defendant's burden of production. She has failed\n24 to meet that burden for the reasons we set forth in our\n25 briefing and arguments today.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool952\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 79 of 9l 79\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl concerns raised by the government can be addressed, they have\n\n2 not carried their burden, and this is really a case that should\n\n3 be subject to strict bail conditions to be set by the court,\n\n4 among other things, to give us any reasonable chance of\n\n5 fighting this -- preparing and fighting this case to trial.\n\n6 Thank you, your Honor.\n\n7 THE COURT: All right. Thank you, counsel.\n\n8 I am prepared to make my ruling.\n\n9 Several provisions of federal law govern the court's\nlo determination whether to detain the defendant or release her on\nll bail pending trial. A court must apply that law equally to all\nl2 defendants no mater hou high profile the case or well off the\nl3 defendant. It is therefore important to begin here with a\nl4 clear articulation of the governing law.\n\nl5 It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell,\nl6 like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption of\nl7 innocence, that is, she is presumed innocent and the only\nl8 grounds for <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> at this stage are, under the law, risk of\nl9 flight or danger to the community.\n2o I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by\n2l the government at this stage in making this determination, but\n22 unless this mater is resolved by a plea, it will remain\n23 entirely for a jury to decide the question of Ms. Maxwell's\n24 guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment.\n25 Turning to the government's standard under Title l8 of\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 8o of 9l 8o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl the United States Code, Section 3l42, the court may order\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> only if it finds that no conditions or combination of\n3 conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person\n4 as required and the safety of any other person in the\n\n5 community.\n\n6 In making a bail determination the court must consider\n7 the defendant's dangerousness, if that's raised, and the\n\n8 defendant's risk of flight. A finding of dangerousness, if\n\n9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing\nlo evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be\nll supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nl2 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is\n\nl3 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal\nl4 law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or\n\nl5 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance\nl6 of the person as required. That's citing l8 U.S.C. 3l42(a) (3).\nl7 The Second Circuit has explained that, ina\n\nl8 presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a Limited\n\nl9 burden of production, not a burden of persuasion, to rebut the\n2o presumption by coming forward with evidence that she does not\nal pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.\n22 Furthermore, once a defendant has met her burden of production\n23 relating to these two factors, the presumption favoring\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to\n25 be considered among those weighed by the district court.

Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, (2d\n2 Cir. 2ol9).\n\n3 The court concludes as follous:\n\n4 First, the nature and circumstances of the offense\n\niy here weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed\n\n9 innocent until proven guilty, but if she were convicted of\n\nlo these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to\nll incentivize her to flee. In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58\n\nl2 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment\nl3 if convicted. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight. The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes. The\n23 government also proffers that this witness testimony will be\n24 corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary\n25 evidence.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient. Were she to flee, the defendant could simply\n23 remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have\n24 observed, home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> with electronic monitoring does not\n25 prevent flight.

But unlike those defendants, Ms. Maxwell possesses\nll significant foreign connections.\n\nl2 This case is distinguishable for other reasons, as\n\nl3 well. For example, the risk of flight in Esposito appears to\nl4 have been based on the resources available to defendant, not\n\nl5 foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from\nl6 being found.\n\nl7 In Madoff, the defendant had already been released on\nl8 a bail package agreed to by the parties for a considerable\n\nl9 period of time before the government sought <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The\n2o court there found there were no circumstances in the\nal intervening period shouing that the defendant had become a\n22 flight risk. Because of these crucial factual differences, the\n23 court finds the cases not on point and not persuasive.\n24 Finally, in arguing for release, the defense raises\n25 the challenges and risks posed by the COVID-l9 pandemic.

The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several\na reasons. Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in\n\n6 which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-l9,\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health\n\n8 conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk\n\n9 from the virus. In other words, she doesn't argue that she is\nlo differently situated than many other federal inmates with\n\nll respect to the risk posed by COVID-l9. In light of the\n\nl2 substantial reasons that I have already identified favoring\n\nl3 Ms. Maxwell's <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and her not making any arguments based\nl4 on her age or health, the COVID-l9 pandemic alone does not\n\nl5 provide grounds for her release.\n\nl6 Second, the defense argues that pretrial release is\n\nl7 necessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, as\n\nl8 COVID-l9-related restrictions at the prison at which she is\n\nl9 held, the MDC, will hamper her ability to meet counsel and\n2o review documents. The court notes that this case is at the\nal early stages. There will be no hearings, let alone a trial,\n22 for a significant period of time. The case does stand in stark\n23 contrast to United States v. Stephens, invoked by the defense,\n24 in which this court at the beginning of the pandemic granted\n25 temporary release to a defendant who was scheduled to have an\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool966\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l2 of 45\n\nwas arrested and has shoun no signs of abating. Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse PF from\nharassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose. The alternative is continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> under oppressive conditions that are\nunprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to\nparticipate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and\npsychological wellbeing.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 45\n(Nathan, J.)

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84);\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “Tc]ircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83); and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\nreasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest and her initial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether\nreasonable bail conditions can be set, and it shous that the proposed set of conditions will\nreasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool987\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002004.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 32 of 45\ncountry. (Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\ndemonstrate Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (d.).\n\nCourts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces\nextradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a condition of\nrelease—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U.S. citizens.\nSee, e.g., United States v.

The Proposed Bail Package Is Expansive and Far Exceeds What Is\nNecessary to Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence in Court\nIn light of the additional information that Ms. Maxwell has provided in connection\nwith this submission, which responds to each of the concerns raised by the government at\nthe initial bail hearing, the government cannot meet its burden to establish that no set of bail\nconditions would reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>—nou over five months—in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002014.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 42 of 45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.'!\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.'” These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n= Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n= Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n\" These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\nThe Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel.

The process is significantly shorter if the\nrequested person consents to their extradition and in those cases the timescales are\napproximately between one and three months.\n\n(d) It is extremely unlikely that bail would be granted in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United States\nprior to trial and in breach of bail.\n\n' The follouing documents were annexed to the instructions: (a) Superseding Indictment, United States v Ghislaine\nMaxwell, dated 8 July 2o2o; (b) a transcript of the arraignment and bail hearing that took place on l4 July 2o2o; (c) the\nMotion to Detain the Defendant dated 2 July 2o2o; (d) the Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion for <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> dated\nlo July 2o2o; (e) and the Government Reply Memorandum in Support of <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> dated l3 July 2o2o.\n° There is no data as to the duration of extradition proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland but it may be inferred\nthat the timescales are similar.\nl922623.l\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l3 of 29\nE. The human rights objections that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face\nextradition to the US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n\n35. Finally, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to demonstrate that her extradition would\nbe incompatible with her rights under the ECHR**. The human rights grounds that might potentially\nbe relied upon by Ms Maxwell are considered in the paragraphs that follou®’.\n\nArticle 3 (prison conditions)\n\n36. Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

The decision in Love was based on section 9l of the 2oo3\nAct, and the court made no finding under Article 3 (para l23). In Hafeez, which was decided in January 2o2o, the High\nCourt received the same evidence as has been before the court in Zove, and concluded that “the evidence in this case falls\nwell short of the necessary threshold” to prove a breach of Article 3 based on the conditions at MDC and MCC (see\nHafeez v Government of the United States of America [2o2o] EWHC l55 (Admin), para. 66).\nl922623.l\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 29\nspecific concerns, such as access to medical care”’. In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition.

In this case, if an extradition request were to be transmited by the USA against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that she\nhas to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail terms\nand conditions in this requesting State.\n\n34. Having outlined the different stages of the French extradition procedure, the second part\nof this opinion will examine the likely outcome of an extradition request against the\nperson of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, if she were to be released on bail and decided to flee\nfrom the USA to France. It will first outline the general bars to extradition (A), and then\nanalyze the status of the protection of nationals from extradition in the French legal\nsystem and in the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France (B). It will conclude\nthat Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s extradition from France to the USA would not be legally\nbarred by her French citizenship, and that it is highly unlikely, under the specific and\nunique circumstances of this case, that French authorities will refuse to enforce an\nextradition decree.\n\nA. General bars to extradition\n\n35. Several bars to extradition may classically be invoked before French courts, namely (l)\na claim that the requested person would be at risk of human rights violations in the\nrequesting State (with regards to the right to a fair trial and the right to be free from\ntorture, inhumane or degrading treatment); (ll) the dual criminality rule; and (i) a claim\nthat the extradition request is politically motivated.\n\n(i) Human rights bars\n\n36. Under the case law of the French Cour de cassation, the Investigating Chamber of the\nCourt of appeal must consider allegations of human rights violations pertaining to the\nconditions of trial and <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in the requesting State!’.

Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 25 of 3o\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT\n5l, rue Ampere, 75ol7 Paris\nDate of birth: l6.o7.l973 oo336783747l3\nFrench English and German national wi@wjavocats.com\nSet up my oun practice in 2oo2 www.wjavocats.com\nMarathon Runner (Paris, 2ol3, 2h57)\nEMPLOYMENT\nSince 2oo2 Founding partner of William Julie Avocats\nINTERNSHIPS & LAW STUDIES\n2ooo-2oo2 Internships specialized in human rights and criminal law:\n= Henri Leclerc (President of the French Ligue des Droits de l’Homme)\n« Eric Plouvier (Human Rights barrister)\n2ooo Admited to the Paris Bar\nl999 Postgraduate Specialization Diploma: Criminal Law and Criminal Justice\nPolicy in Europe\nThesis Supervisor Mme Delmas Marty, University of Paris Sorbonne\nl999 Certificate of criminal sciences, University of Paris Assas\nEXTRADITION LAW\n= Extradition cases in and outside the EU, including USA, Saudi Arabia, China, Russia,\nSouth Korea, Japan, Irak, Iran, Lebanon, India\n=\" Regularly appears as French judicial expert before Common law courts on extradition issues\nand prison <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> conditions (UK, Hong Kong, USA)\n= Mutual legal assistance: cooperation with various investigation authorities on international\ncases (DEA, FBI, SFO, OCTRIS), cross-border penitentiary law (repatriation)\n= Obtained in 2ol7 a major change in French extradition law (right to challenge European arrests\nwarrants issued against foreigners - Michael Ofsouitz case)\nCRIMINAL LAW\n\"  Testified before the Parliamentary Enquiry into miscarriages of justice during the Outreau trial\n« Fraud cases, including Emmanuel Henning 4o million pounds mobile phone VAT fraud in the\nUK, and Marseilles 385 Million carbon gas fraud\n= Business criminal law (money laundering, bribery and corruption, misappropriation of public\nfunds, misuse of company assets, offenses related to public tenders, stock exchange law)\n= Important drug cases involving international issues and organized crimes (Morocco, Lebanon,\nHolland, Germany, GB), including 4 tons cocaine Tobago clipper case\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 28 of 3o\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Docket No. 2o-CR-33o (AIN)\n\n- against -\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, AFFIDAVIT AND WAIVER OF\n\nEXTRADITION\nDefendant.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, being duly sworn, deposes and says:\n\nl.

In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 7 of 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry.

Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 8 of 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 9 of 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> analysis when the Government\nseeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page lo of 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, “the\ndefendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut\nthat presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”\nUnited States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes,\n254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)). The act of producing such evidence, houever, “does not\neliminate the presumption favoring <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” /d. Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to\nbe considered among those weighed by the district court,’ while the Government retains the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\nat 436.\n\nWhen the Court has already issued a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was\nnot knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the\ndefendant. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an atempt to reopen\na <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”\nUnited States v. Petrov, l5 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26,\n2ol5). Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered\neven where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the\noriginal hearing,” United States v. Roue, o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 2l, 2oo3), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page ll of 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002173.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l2 of 36\ndefendant faces up to 35 years of incarceration, and may very well spend the remainder of her\nnatural life in prison. The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002176.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l5 of 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002177.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l6 of 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 22 of 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 24 of 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 25 of 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.’ The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was still warranted. (See Tr. 87).\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 26 of 36\nthis Court already weighed in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and confirmation of that deception only\nreemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions.\n\nNou, the defense has submited a financial report that reflects the defendant has\napproximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial\nServices. (Def. Ex. O). Accepting the financial report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. In\nother words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would\nstill have millions of dollars at her disposal. She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access. The financial report only addresses the\ndefendant’s assets without detailing her income at all. The defendant has similarly provided the\nCourt with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective\n® In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in\nunrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other\nitems. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the\nretainer paid to her atorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled.\n\n7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents\nof the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond\namount. These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as\na result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 28 of 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 29 of 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same). Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3o of 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3l of 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v. Bodmer, No. o3 Cr. 947 (SAS),\n2oo4 WL l6979o, at *l, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2oo4) (seting conditions of bail where defendant\narrested abroad had already consented to extradition to the United States and finding that the\nGovernment—whose argument was “based, in large part, on speculation” as to the defendant’s\nfinancial resources—had “failed to meet its burden”). And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v. Patrick Ho, l7 Cr. 779 (KBF), Dkt. 49 (S.D.N.Y.

Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, weighing\nfurther in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 34 of 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002230.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo4 Filed l2/28/2o Pagelo ____\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/28/2o |}\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose.

The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “[e]xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that [it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“[A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”). Nonetheless, “‘the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 4 of 22\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’” English, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting\nMercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986)\n(“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”). Even when “a\ndefendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does\nnot disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district\ncourt.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail\nhearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and\nthat has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(f). But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “[a]s the court has already held one <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v. Havens, 487\nF. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing because the\nnew information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant until trial).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7-9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 5 of 22\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other\nperson and the community.” A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 6 of 22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services. /d. at 2-3.\nFurthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who\nwould prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or\nPretrial Services and who would escort her when she is authorized to leave. /d. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo—l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law enforcement prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25-29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34—\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 7 of 22\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 8 of 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information—including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “[a] judicial officer\nconducting a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 9 of 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at 3o-33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page lo of 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, 4 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3-83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l3 of 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6-88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l5 of 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l6 of 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nC. Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l9 of 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“Te]ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4-87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4—88:2. As other courts have observed, “home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(@), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo225l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2o of 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.?\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they\nare not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the Court.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2l of 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force. The Court need not hold another\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document ll7 Filed ol/25/2l Page 2 of 3\nl MEN\nNe oN N U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\\ Bee |e N Federal Bureau of Prisons\nSs ae Sg) Hy Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center\n8o 29h Street\nBrooklyn, New York ll232\nJanuary 25, 2o2l\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material.

For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 38\nnot expired, would be punishable by up to three months in prison — /ess time than Ms.\nMaxwell has already spent in pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.

Even if there\nwere ambiguity, which there is not, that ambiguity must be construed against the government and\nin favor of the defense. Accordingly, the indictment must be dismissed. In the alternative, Ms.\nMaxwell should be permited to take discovery regarding the intent of the parties to the NPA\nwith respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, and the Court should hold an evidentiary\nhearing in aid of this Motion.\n\nI.

Here, the NPA unambiguously precludes prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators, and the indictment in this case must be dismissed.\n\nIn support of its July 2o2o motion for Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the government raised\nthree arguments why it contends the NPA does not bar Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution: (l) that Ms.\nMaxwell supposedly lacks standing to enforce the NPA; (i) that the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision applies only in the SDFL; and (i) that the provision is limited to conduct occurring\nduring the 2ool-o7 time period and to violations of statutes specifically referenced in the NPA.\nGovernment’s Reply Memorandum in Support of <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> (“Reply Mem.”), Dkt.

The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo264o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002657.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 25\nthat Minor Victim-l would engage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of\nNew York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Id. § l9.\nARGUMENT\n\n“Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,” a non-capital criminal offense must be\n\ncharged “within five years next after such offense shall have been commited.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3282(a); see l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (l994) (same).

Second, by\nits plain terms, § 3283 applies only to offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. But the sexual or physical abuse or kidnaping of a\nchild is not an element of any of the offenses charged here.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide an update regarding the\ndefendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) pursuant to\nthe Court’s Order dated December 8, 2o2o. (Dkt. No. 92). Over the past two months, the\nGovernment has had multiple communications with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal counsel through those communications.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC’s mail room, where every piece of mail is processed\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2727\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l59 Filed o2/l6/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nAs the government states, a flashlight is pointed at the ceiling of her isolation cell every\nl5 minutes, from approximately 9:3o pm to 6:3o am. It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied. In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily\nnewspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP\nsystem, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo273o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l59 Filed o2/l6/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the deleterious effect of the conditions under which Ms.\nMaxwell is detained. Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 8 of 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 4 of 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 5 of 9\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2752\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002754.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 7 of 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 2 of l2\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 4 of l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y.

Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v.

Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 7 of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 8 of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002777.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl69 Filed o3/22/2l Page ll of l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2777\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page8ofl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page9ofl8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses.

The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis week’s filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating\nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l92 Filed o3/3l/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nTo be clear, any such request will not be made from any desire of Ms. Maxwell to delay\nher trial but rests squarely on the government’s late, tactical, expansion of this prosecution.\nAt the initial appearance on July l4, 2o2o, the defense agreed to the July l2\" trial date\nbased on the government’s representation that is would not file a superseding indictment:\nThe trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to the court's\napproval, assumes there will be no substantive superseding indictment. If there is\none, which the government has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I\nassume not at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not just trial\nschedule but other schedule as well.\n\nJuly l4, 2o2o Transcript at l6 -l7 (emphasis added).\n\nIn response, the Court made the follouing inquiry:\n\nLet me go ahead and ask, Ms. Moe, Mr. Cohen has made a representation but I\nwill ask if you do anticipate at this time filing any further superseding indictments\nadding either defendants or additional charges?\n\nId. at l7.\n\nThe government confirmed:\n\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we\ndo not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment.\nId.\n\nBased on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July l2, 2o2l trial date and her\nlawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date.\nIt was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government\nbelatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The\ntiming suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial\nmotions and government concern about the nou-apparent weakness of its case. The government\nmay be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and\nrelied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel’s readiness for trial and\nMs. Maxwell’s prolonged <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nThis is no longer the “two-week” trial as represented by the government. By adding\ncharges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally\ndestroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time alloted. The continual media\natention this case garners, in addition to podcasts, documentaries, books and the like, will likely\nrequire the bulk of that time to seat a fair and impartial jury, provided that constitutional right\ncan be guaranteed.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l92 Filed o3/3l/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

No mater hou often the government tries\nto present Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> as superior to other inmates, it continues to miss the mark.\nWe stand by our previous responses and reiterate that Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is unwarranted\nand overly restrictive. It is tantamount to “pay-it-forward” punishment served pretrial.\n\nThe government’s leter provides the opportunity to flush out the persistent unsanitary\nconditions at the MDC, which long predate Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. This past weekend there\nwas a pervasive stench of sewage in Ms. Maxwell’s unit necessitating guards to flush pipes by\npouring water doun open drains in an effort to trap and disperse gaseous emissions. As guards\nexplained to Ms. Maxwell, there are three drains in the day area, and when the plumbing system\ngoes unused, gases escape from the drains and cause the stench. At times the stench in Ms.\nMaxwell’s isolation cell has been overwhelming due to overflouing of toilets in the cellblock\nabove. Due to lack of privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from using the toilet in the isolation cell\nand, as directed by the guards, she flushes frequently to avoid plumbing problems. At times, the\nstench is apparent upon entering the visiting area.

STERNHEIAA\n\nThe Court’s request for updates concerning Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\ndoes litle to improve her situation. Quite the contrary. The government’s update leters are\nanything but helpful: They fuel media atention which resounds to Ms. Maxwell’s detriment. The\ngovernment’s atempt to publicly embarrass and humiliate Ms. Maxwell in the hostile court of\npublic opinion further erodes the likelihood that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\nThe government’s review of the MDC may be Yelp-worthy, but it does not justify Ms.\nMaxwell’s inappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. If the government wants to compare Ms. Maxwell to other\ndefendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail.\n\nIt is debatable whether the public has a “right to knou” about Ms. Maxwell’s conditions\nof confinement, but clearly, it does not extend to personal and medical information. The\ngovernment safeguards personal information regarding its witnesses and is reluctant to release\nany unless mandated by statute or court order. Yet the government fails to accord Ms. Maxwell\nthe same treatment.\n\nShould the Court request further updates from the government, we request that they be\nlimited to changed circumstances and filed under seal or subject to appropriate redaction.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The Government contacted defense counsel\non March 29, 2o2l to convey its availability for a call to discuss some of the issues above as well\nas a supplemental briefing schedule for certain of the defendant’s pending motions, among other\nissues. Although such a call has not yet taken place, the Government remains available to confer\nwith the defense regarding these issues, as well as a schedule for trial-related filings such as\nmotions in limine and requests to charge. Indeed, the Government and defense counsel have\nconferred extensively by email over the last several days regarding defense requests to review\ncertain physical evidence and other defense inquiries regarding discovery in this case. As a result\nof this conferral, the Government has scheduled an evidence review session for the defendant and\ndefense counsel to review physical evidence in the custody of the FBI relating to this case in the\ncoming days. The Government will continue to be available to confer with defense counsel and is\nprepared to discuss scheduling maters whenever the defense would like.\n\nFinally, nothing about the S2 Indictment supports reconsideration of this Court’s three\nprior decisions ordering the defendant detained pending trial. If anything, the arguments in favor\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> are nou stronger. The defendant nou faces two additional charges, which increase\nthe maximum penalty she faces to eighty years in prison. She also faces even more evidence,\nincluding a fourth victim, who is corroborated by independent evidence, including other witnesses\nand documents such as travel records, phone records, shipment records, and items recovered\nduring the execution of a search warrant. Moreover, as the defense seems to implicitly recognize,\nthe S2 Indictment undermines certain legal arguments the defense previously made in atacking\nthe prior indictment in this case. (See Dkt. No. l92 at 2 (“The timing suggests that the decision to\nsupersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial motions and government concern about\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo29l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page7of8\nPage 7\n\nthe nou-apparent weakness of its case.”’”)). Taken together, these factors all point to the conclusion\nthat the defendant nou faces an even stronger case with even more severe consequences upon\nconviction. The S2 Indictment thus further increases the defendant’s incentives to flee, and it does\nnothing to alter the other factors that the Court previously found weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,\nincluding the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, skill at evading detection, and prior lack of candor\nwith the Court.\n\nThe Government has no objection to an in-person arraignment, but the Government objects\nto the defense request for yet another bail hearing. The defense has nou had three bites at that\nparticular apple and is currently appealing the issues raised therein to the Second Circuit, where\nargument is scheduled to take place on April 26, 2o2l. The introduction of additional charges,\nreflecting additional evidence, in no way supports a fourth argument for release, and the Court\nshould not entertain yet another application under these circumstances, especially when this very\nissue is currently before the Circuit. Certainly, the fact that a grand jury has found probable cause\nto believe that the defendant has commited even more crimes does not somehou suggest that the\nGovernment’s case is in any way weaker than it was at the time of the prior three bail applications.\nTo the contrary, the detailed allegations in the S2 Indictment make clear that there is nou more\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nNor does anything about the S2 Indictment support the defense request that the Court take\nthe extraordinary step of holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue of bail. “It is well established\nin this circuit that proffers are permissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation\ncontexts.” United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are\ntypically informal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery. Often the opposing parties\nsimply describe to the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page8sof8\nPage 8\nit.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, in this Circuit, District Courts regularly\naccept the Government’s proffer regarding its evidence when considering a bail application. And\nhere, of course, the Court has not only the Government’s proffer but also the grand jury’s\ndetermination that probable cause exists as to each of the charged offenses. Defense counsel’s\nrequest to deviate from that ordinary practice appears to be a thinly veiled atempt at a fishing\nexpedition through which the defense hopes to obtain early Jencks Act material and a pretrial\nopportunity to cross-examine the Government’s witnesses, including victims of sexual abuse. It\nis to avoid such a fishing expedition, among other reasons, that courts in this Circuit proceed by\nproffer when considering bail motions. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir.\nl986) (“a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial . . . or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant”). The S2 Indictment offers no reason to deviate from that practice.\n%* %* %*\n\nFor the reasons above, the Government respectfully submits that trial can and should\nproceed as scheduled on July l2, 2o2l. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe in-person arraignment on the S2 Indictment also serve as a conference at which to finalize a\nschedule for supplemental pretrial motion briefing as well as a schedule for trial-related\nsubmissions.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe\nLara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-oooo292o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002930.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 6 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages.

The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 348\nU.S. Department of Justice\nAtorney\nGeneral\nDeputy\nAtorney General\nGENERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL\nOFFICE OF THE OFFICE OF OFHCE OF\nSOLICITOR LEGAL POLICY PUBLIC\nGENERAL AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF OFFICE OF\nOFFICE OF COMMUNITY LEGISLATIVE LEGAL FEDERAL NATIONAL OFFICE OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS INAL\nJUSTICE eoneine, ANON CIVIL DIVISION AFFAIRS COUNSEL BUREAU OF postr SECURITY PROFESSIONAL\nPROGRAMS.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nI. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 348\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On the\n\nfirst one he gets l2 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets\nlG FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permiting the\ngovernment to withhold the requested records. See 5 U.S.C. § 552.\n7 Sentences falling within Zones A or B of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines permit probation or confinement\nalternatives to imprisonment.\n\n72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\n\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time. I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end. I have selected tomorrou at 5:oo because it\ngives them enough time to really negotiate an agreement if they are\nserious about it, and if not, it gives me one day before the Jewish\nholiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday . . . [September 25] , when I\nplan to [file charges], and it gives the office sufficient time to review\nthe indictment package.\nDo you concur?\nA few minutes later, the incoming West Palm Beach manager emailed Lourie, suggesting that\nLourie “talk to Epstein and close the deal.”!\"®\n\nWithin moments, Lourie replied to the manager, with a copy to Villafafia, reporting that he\nhad just spoken with Lefkouitz and agreed “to two fed[eral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap)\nwith nonbinding recommendation for l8 months. When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates. See\nllo\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 348\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'’4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.!”\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/. The “Stockade” was a “louer security ‘camp-style’ facility”\nco-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Both were administered by the Sheriffs Office.\n\nl78 Plea in the Circuit Court, signed June 3o, 2oo8, and filed in court. Villafafia complained to Goldberger when\nshe learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”\ndts The Information is atached as Exhibit 5.\nl75 State v. Epstein, case nos. o6-CF-9454 and o8-CF-938l, Transcript of Plea Conference at 4l-42 (Fifteenth\nJudicial Circuit, June 3o, 2oo8) (Plea Hearing Transcript). Belohlavek told OPR that reciting the statutory language\nof the charge as the factual basis for the plea was the typical practice for a state court plea.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram. Florida Statute § 948.ool(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the\ncommunity.”\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 348\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'*’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] .... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo332o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA.

Dkt. No. 2o7. The Court\nalso granted severance as to the perjury counts. Both the denial of the motions to dismiss and the\nseverance of the perjury counts are relevant to the requests for a bail hearing and for an\nadjournment of the trial date. The Court addresses both in this Order.\n\nFirst, the request for a renewed bail hearing is denied. The Court held an original bail\nhearing on July l4, 2o2o. After extensive argument and presentation of information, the Court\nfound that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance as required, determining as a result that Maxwell was a flight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nwithout bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Dkt. No. 23. The Court based its\nconclusion on the presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3), and its weighing of\nthe l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense charged,\nthe weight of the evidence, and Maxwell’s history and characteristics. Since that time, Maxwell\nhas twice sought reconsideration of the Court’s original bail determination and offered different\nbail packages and proposed conditions of release. The Court carefully considered those requests\nand denied them in writen Orders, concluding that none of the new information had any material\nbearing on the Court’s original conclusion and that the Government again met its burden of\nestablishing that Maxwell poses a substantial risk of flight and that no conditions or combination\nof conditions could reasonably assure her appearance as required. Dkt. Nos. lo6, l69.\n\nMaxwell nou seeks a new bail hearing at which “witnesses [would] testify regarding the\npurported strength of the government’s case.” Dkt. No. l92 at 3. The request is denied. The S2\nIndictment raises no issues that warrant reconsideration of the Court’s prior bail determinations.\nOn the contrary, the new charges contained in the S2 indictment as well as the Court’s resolution\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page3of5\nof the pre-trial motions strengthen, rather than weaken, the Court’s prior conclusions regarding\nflight risk. Maxwell is entitled to appeal that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> determination, and she is exercising that\nright. But it does not follou that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail\ndeterminations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of\nthe Government’s case is tested. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are\npermissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.\nLaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). Before making its prior bail determinations, the\nCourt scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government’s proffer and concluded that\nthe proffered case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government’s case will be tested at\ntrial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case\nproceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and\nall relevant circumstances. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the\npublic and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See l8 U.S.C.\n§3l6l(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act provides a right “to proceedings free\nfrom unreasonable delay.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nThis leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell’s request\nfor an adjournment. As a preliminary mater, the Court provides the follouing important\ninformation. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July l2, 2o2l, currently\nthe precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of\nthe presiding judge. SDNY is still operating under special protocols for jury selection during the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. Because of a limited number of reconfigured courtrooms and spaces large\nenough to hold jury selection and trial safely, the protocols centralize the scheduling of access to\njuries and reconfigured courtrooms pursuant to an established protocol for trial priority.

As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, the Government has already\nincluded Rule l6 discovery relating to the S2 Indictment in its prior productions to the defense,\nand the Government has provided the defense with a list of pages within those discovery\nproductions that are particularly pertinent to the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment.”\nContrary to the defense’s suggestion in its most recent leter, the largest discovery production in\nthis case came from electronic devices seized from Jeffrey Epstein.

The defense did not request to review\nthose materials until March 2o2l, after which the Government coordinated with defense counsel,\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals to arrange for multiple days in April\n2o2l during which all of the materials were made available for review. The Government is of\ncourse willing to make similar arrangements should defense counsel believe additional review of\nthose materials is necessary.\n3 Only yesterday did defense counsel provide the Government with a list of documents that the\ndefendant has been unable to review from the prior discovery productions. As it has done in the\npast when such issues have been raised, the Government will work with its staff and staff at the\nMetropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) to address these issues as expeditiously as possible. The\nGovernment notes, houever, that had defense counsel raised these specific issues earlier, the\nGovernment could have addressed them much sooner.\nSimilarly, the defense only raised concerns about metadata on certain photographs this month,\neven though those photographs were produced to the defense in November 2o2o.

Maxwell,” the\nproduction from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law enforcement entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her pre-trial motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6.

Those subpoenas lacked any specificity and\nwere for:\n\nAny and all records relating to inmate [cooperator name], including but not limited\n\nto: (a) name and address of all [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] locations in which\n\n[cooperator name] was housed, the dates when [cooperator name] was housed in\n\nsuch facilities, and all records relating to the transfer of [cooperator name] between\n\nand among [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] facilities; (b) all records of phone calls made\n\nto and from [cooperator name] from [Bureau of Prisons/DOC] custody, including\n\nbut not limited to: call logs and audio recordings; and (c) all Corrlinks emails sent\n\nto and from [cooperator name’s] account.\n\nAs this Court correctly pointed out, the subpoenas were unlimited in time or scope and\ncalled for the production of either inadmissible hearsay or privileged information. /d. at *2.\nAdditionally, this Court observed in Pena, at *3, as applicable here, that:\n\n[T]he Court trusts that the Government is aware of its obligations under Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963), Giglio v.

Ms. Maxwell reluctantly agreed to set the trial out for a full year — despite the Court’s\norder of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> -- to ensure that she and her counsel would have sufficient time to analyze the\ngovernment’s case and prepare for a defense. The case was scheduled to begin July l2, 2o2l\nand continue for two weeks.\n\nFollouing the return of the S2 indictment, the government nou estimates that “its case-\nin-chief will take up to three weeks,” and thus “propose[s] reserving four weeks for trial in this\nmater.” Dkt. l99 at 4. The government did not, apparently, take into account (a) the amount of\ntime that will be required to empanel a jury in this high-publicity case, nor (b) account for the\ndefense to have ample time to put on its oun case. Simply put, defense counsel believe that a\nthree-week government case means a total trial length of 5-6 weeks, allouing Ms. Maxwell\n' Both Bobbi C. Sternheim, Esq. and AUSA Lara Pomerantz are counsel in |, a three-\ndefendant case. The government estimates the trial will last 8 weeks. The defense believes it may\ntake longer because all defendants and many witnesses do not speak English.

(Dkt. No.\n257). The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court’s\nOrder, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.\n\nMDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a mater of course throughout the facility\nfor the safety and security of the inmates at the institution. During these flashlight checks, MDC\nstaff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that\nthe inmate is present in the cell, breathing, and not in distress. MDC staff conduct flashlight checks\nevery 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the “SHU”) and conduct\nflashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular\nintervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nWith respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes\nbecause the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule. That is\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 272 Filed o5/o7/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 272 Filed o5/o7/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

There can be no doubt that the MDC was follouing\ndirectives from Atorney General William Barr and the Director of the BOP in determining that\nMs. Maxwell should not be placed in general population, not Ms. Maxwell.

There was no meaningful conferral. Previously,\nof course, the government took the position that its accusers wanted the soonest possible trial\ndate.\n\nThe government’s requests to defer the trial from November 8\" to a November 29\" start\ndate rest on faulty premises. First, they contend, “continuity of counsel” is needed so that one of\nthe four assigned Assistant U.S. Atorneys can be available to try this case. In the initial stages of\nour review of the 2o,ooo plus pages of non-testifying witness statements, is clear that two of the\nother assigned AUSAs have been involved from the very beginning of this investigation and\nhave actively participated in all of the interviews together. They were joined as often as not by\nyet a fourth AUSA who previously was assigned to this case and who still works in their office.\nNotably the government does not claim that the three remaining assistants are unfamiliar with the\nfacts or law of the case, nor that they are not competent trial counsel.\n\nSecond, the government points to a “potential” conflict of one witness who reportedly is\nunavailable (for unknoun reasons) for nearly two months — all of October through to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5 of 349\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004327.jpg": "U.S. Department of Justice\n2 2oo6 - 2oo8\n~\n—\no)\n(7)\no Atorney\nco)\n7 General\nou\n=i Deputy\na Atorney General\nSa\nKe)\n(om)\n2)\n&\nLL SOLICITOR ASSOCIATE\nGENERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\na\n\nI\noO\na OFFICE OF THE OFFICE OF OFFICE OF\n\nSOLICITOR LEGAL POLICY PUBLIC\n= GENERAL AFFAIRS\nco)\n5 “Snare OFFICE OF OFFICE OF\nNATIONAL\na OFFICE OF a iol ENTS LEGISLATIVE LEGAL FEDERAL Pranariat OFFICE OF\n5 JUSTICE ines iaegratent CIVIL DIVISION AFFAIRS COUNSEL BUREAU OF are SECURITY PROFESSIONAL\nlat PROGRAMS one INVESTIGATION DIVISION RESPONSIBILITY\nOFFICE OF INTER-\nENVIRONMENT SOE EN ee OFFICE OF THE OFFICE OF THE\n\nuw EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF ANTITRUST AND NATURAL AND PUBLIC Delcs BUREAU OF\n< ‘OFFICE FOR THE INFORMATION DIVISION RESOURCES UIASOM ENFORCEMENT PRISONS INSPECTOR PARDON\noo.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 54 of 349\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 88 of 349\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 99 of 349\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'!® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On the\n\nfirst one he gets l2 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets\nlG FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permiting the\ngovernment to withhold the requested records.

I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end. I have selected tomorrou at 5:oo because it\ngives them enough time to really negotiate an agreement if they are\nserious about it, and if not, it gives me one day before the Jewish\nholiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday . . . [September 25] , when I\nplan to [file charges], and it gives the office sufficient time to review\nthe indictment package.\nDo you concur?\nA few minutes later, the incoming West Palm Beach manager emailed Lourie, suggesting that\nLourie “talk to Epstein and close the deal.”!\"®\n\nWithin moments, Lourie replied to the manager, with a copy to Villafafia, reporting that he\nhad just spoken with Lefkouitz and agreed “to two fed[eral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap)\nwith nonbinding recommendation for l8 months. When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo8 of 349\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l37 of 349\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'”4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.!”°\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/. The “Stockade” was a “louer security ‘camp-style’ facility”\nco-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Both were administered by the Sheriff's Office.\n\nl78 Plea in the Circuit Court, signed June 3o, 2oo8, and filed in court. Villafafia complained to Goldberger when\nshe learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”\ndts The Information is atached as Exhibit 5.\nl75 State v. Epstein, case nos. o6-CF-9454 and o8-CF-938l, Transcript of Plea Conference at 4l-42 (Fifteenth\nJudicial Circuit, June 3o, 2oo8) (Plea Hearing Transcript). Belohlavek told OPR that reciting the statutory language\nof the charge as the factual basis for the plea was the typical practice for a state court plea.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4o of 349\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l44 of 349\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram. Florida Statute § 948.ool(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the\ncommunity.”\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l45 of 349\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'®* By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22l of 349\ninformation about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant still has access to both a\ndesktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on\nwhich to review discovery. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the\nMDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her atorneys. This discovery review\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s assigned cell. Accordingly, the\ndefendant continues to be permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day\nroom, the defendant continues to have exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop,\na television, a phone on which to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer.

The government accuses Ms. Maxwell of using a cart to barricade the door to the VTC\nroom. The cart was never used to barricade. The government has chosen to make this an issue - when it\nnever was - to justify the restriction placed on the amount of legal materials Ms. Maxwell can bring into\nthe VTC room on any given day.\n\nThe government mischaracterizes facts to which it does not have first-hand knouledge.\nMs. Maxwell continues to use the cart daily to bring legal material into the VTC room and to remove\nthose documents at the end of the VTC session. Most of her legal papers are kept in a separate room.\nShe is only alloued to bring a certain portion of documents to any given VTC session and is not alloued\nto leave the VTC room to collect additional documents that may be needed for review and discussion\nwith counsel. The amount of legal material Ms. Maxwell can access depends upon rules that fluctuate\nwith each team rotated into the MDC every two weeks to guard her.\n\nThis limitation impacts the productivity of VTC and in-person legal conferences and\ncompromises Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

The government also\nrepeatedly and erroneously argued that Ms. Maxwell’s conduct at the time of her arrest\nevidenced an intent to evade law enforcement. See 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in Supp. of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> (Dkt. o22) at 7-8; 7/l4/2o2o Tr. of Bail Hrg. at 3l:2o-34:5; l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in\nOpp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l-22.\nThe government’s assertion rests on groundless speculation concerning actions which\nMs. Maxwell was forced to take in the days after Epstein’s arrest to protect herself and her\nfamily and friends from unrelenting harassment by the media and the very real danger of\nphysical threats against them. In particular, the government has noted the follouing in its prior\nsubmissions:\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl4\n\ne Ms. Maxwell moved residences and switched her primary phone\nnumber (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress. !\n\ne At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell allegedly ignored the\ndirection of FBI agents to open the front door of her residence and\ninstead moved into an interior room of the house.”\n\ne During a security sweep of the house, FBI agents found a cell phone\nwrapped in tin foil on top of a desk.?\n\nMs. Maxwell thoroughly rebuted each of these points in her second bail motion. See\nl2/l4/2o2o Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Bail (Dkt. 97) at l8-25. Ms. Maxwell\noffered not just argument in response, but independent factual corroboration of her position that\nstands in direct opposition to the government’s incorrect and improper inferences. For example,\nMs. Maxwell provided a leter from her spouse, who confirmed that Ms. Maxwell’s decision to\nleave her family, move residences, and eventually setle in New Hampshire—where she\nremained continuously for over seven months until her arrest—was a difficult choice that was\nmotivated by the pressing need to protect herself and her family from media intrusion and\npotential violent threats, not by a desire to evade law enforcement.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write to once again ask the Court to release Ghislaine Maxwell prior to trial on the\nconditions set forth in her previous bail applications. My weekly in-person legal visits with Ms.\nMaxwell are conducted under the most humiliating circumstances that I have ever experienced in\nmany decades of federal criminal practice. As disturbing and invasive as they are for no\njustifiable reason, I get to leave; Ms. Maxwell does not. The surveillance rivals scenes of Dr.\nHannibal Lecter’s incarceration as portrayed in the movie, “Silence of the Lambs,” despite the\nabsence of the cage and plastic face guard. Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> for the past\nl6 months continue to be reprehensible and uterly inappropriate for woman on the cusp of\nturning 6o with no criminal record or history of violence. It is unwarranted, unrelenting, and\nuterly inappropriate.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been subject to physical and emotional abuse by the correction officers,\npoor and unsanitary living conditions, insufficient nutrition, difficulties reviewing the millions of\nlegal discovery documents in the case against her, and sleep deprivation. She has been\nconsistently housed in segregation from all other inmates, with rotating teams of multiple\ncorrections officers per daily shift which rotate on a bi-weekly basis. Many of the officers are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o8 Filed ll/o3/2l Page3of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

At that time, Atorney General William Barr said he initially had his oun suspicions\nabout Epstein’s death while detained at the MCC but came to conclude that Epstein’s death, an\napparent suicide, was the result of “a perfect storm of screw-ups.”!\n\nDuring an interview with ABC News, Barr stated he was “livid” when he learned that\nJeffrey Epstein had commited suicide and “happy that they had goten Ms. Maxwell.” ? When\nasked if the government had Maxwell's security “locked in” to ensure she would neither be able to\nkill herself or be harmed, Barr answered, with a mixture of laughter and a smile on his face: “Yes.\nWe have asked them to tell us specifically the protocols they're follouing, and we have a number\nof redundant systems to monitor the situation.” Id. (emphasis added.)\n\nMs. Maxwell has consistently described, and complained formally, of being subject to\nunfair and inconsistent treatment and threatening and intimidating behavior by corrections\nofficers and ongoing sleep deprivation throughout her incarceration. The flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes have significantly hindered her ability to sleep, as she frequently wakes up every time\nthe guards shine the flashlight into her cell. When she has been transported from the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nfacility to court, she is awakened between 3:oo and 4:oo a.m., transported to the courthouse, and\nheld in a cold cell on an approximately l2-inch metal bench for hours prior to her scheduled\ncourt appearance.\n\nThe experience of unfairness, disrespect, and a lack of safety significantly contributes to\npsychological distress in incarcerated individuals.?

Nor was she provided any soap or any disinfectant to wash her hands, in\ndisregard of CDC pandemic protocols. When she caught a few minutes of sleep in the holding\ncell, a marshal jabbed her in the leg to get her atention.® She is already sleep deprived.

Their respective statements do not corroborate one another and\nfurther demonstrate contamination and collusion from various sources. These disclosures\nsubstantially undermine the strength of the government’s case and underscore the fact that Ms.\nMaxwell should not be detained.\n\n° The male marshal assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail on Monday was inappropriately rough with and\nthreatening to her. After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a scheduled evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of innocence and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service. I made a complaint to the U.S. Marshal and have requested that\nthis particular marshal not be assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail in the future.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s motion to\nreconsider this Court’s prior bail determinations. (Dkt. 4o8 (“Def. Mot.’)). This Court has\nrepeatedly found that there are no conditions of release that can reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance (Dkt. 93, lo6, l69), and the Second Circuit has twice rejected the defendant’s appeals\n(see United States v. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 86, 96 (2d Cir.)). The defendant’s latest motion\nlargely repeats arguments that have been made and rejected before. There is no basis for the Court\nto reconsider its prior rulings.\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nl. The Court’s First <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Order\n\nAfter the defendant’s arrest, this Court received multiple writen submissions and held a\nlengthy oral argument on the question of bail. (See Dkt. 93 (“First Order’”’)). On July l4, 2o2o, in\na detailed oral ruling, the Court ordered the defendant detained on the basis of risk of flight. (/d.\nat 79-9l). First, the Court found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in\nfavor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,” given the statutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> triggered by charges involving\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006202.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page2ofll\nPage 2\n\nminor victims and the potential penalties those charges carry. U/d. at 82). Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found\nthat although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full\naccounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not\nopaque, as it is, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That conclusion was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87). The Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent\nconduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the\ndefense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). The Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page3ofll\nPage 3\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be insufficient” because\nthe defendant could remove the monitor and evade private guards. (/d. at 87-88).\n\nFinally, the Court rejected the defendant’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the\ndifficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated client, noting that the defendant had many\nmonths to prepare for trial. (/d. at 89-9o). The Court found that measures in place were sufficient\nto ensure the defendant’s access to her counsel, but also directed the Government to work with the\ndefense “to provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and stated that the\ndefense may make specific applications to the Court for further relief if the process was\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).\n\n2. The Court’s Second <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Order\n\nThe defendant renewed her bail application in December 2o2o, presenting a revised bail\npackage with additional financial restrictions. (Dkt. 97). After receiving further writen\nsubmissions (Dkt. loo, lo3), the Court denied the defendant’s application in a writen opinion\nissued on December 28, 2o2o. (Dkt. lo6 (“Second Order”)). The Court found that the arguments\npresented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and\nthat no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2). The Court explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are serious and\n\ncarry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence\n\nproffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\n\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that\n\ndoes not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in\n\nhiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important\n\nties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.\n(/d. at 2). The Court rejected the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of\nits case at the bail hearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5oflil\nPage 5\n(Id. at l6). The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o). The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). And\nthe Court reiterated that it would continue to ensure that the defendant is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o n.3).\n\n3. The Court’s Third <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Order\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant filed a third bail application, proposing two additional\nbail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British citizenship; and (2) placement of a\nportion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account to be overseen by a monitor. (Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court concluded that the defendant’s new application did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d.\nat 7).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006206.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page6ofll\nPage 6\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s argument that the strength of the evidence was\ndiminished by her then-pending pre-trial motions (which have since been denied). (/d. at 5-6). The\nCourt also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by the defendant, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the [foreign\ncitizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed monitorship, the defendant\n“would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll). The Court concluded, “If the Court could conclude that any set\nof conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her\nrelease. Yet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\n4. The Second Circuit’s Orders\n\nThe defendant filed appeals from the Court’s second and third <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> orders. After\nhearing oral argument, the Circuit denied the defendant’s motion for bail in a writen order. (See\nUnited States v. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 86 (2d Cir. Apr. 27, 2o2l)).\n\nFollouing that decision, the defendant submited a leter to this Court asking it “to address\nMs. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing MDC to cease l5-minute light surveillance of Ms.\nMaxwell or justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.” (Dkt. 256 at 2). The Court\npromptly ordered the Government to confer with MDC counsel and provide the Court with an\nexplanation regarding the use of flashlights and the basis for it, which the Government then did.\n(Dkt. 257, 27o). On May l4, 2o2l, this Court issued an order denying the defendant’s request for\nan order directing the MDC to modify its nightime monitoring schedule. (Dkt. 282). In reaching\nthis decision, the Court noted that the defendant’s claim that MDC staff were shining the light\ndirectly into her eyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page7ofll\nPage 7\nshouing.” (/d. at l). The Court also found that “nothing in the record plausibly establishes that\ncurrent protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with\nher lawyers.” (/d. at 2).\n\nThe defendant then filed another motion in the Second Circuit, seeking bail or, in the\nalternative, an evidentiary hearing regarding the conditions of her confinement. (See United States\nv. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 89 (2d Cir. May l7, 2o2l)). In the motion, she renewed her claims\nthat the “horrific conditions [at MDC] make it impossible to prepare for trial.” (/d. at 2; see also\nid. at 2-3 (listing alleged horrific conditions, such as sleep deprivation, broun water, surveillance\nof atorney-client meetings, overflouing sewage, computer without sufficient capacity to review\ndiscovery)). The Second Circuit denied her motion in a writen order. (See United States v.\nMaxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 96 (2d Cir. June 2, 2o2l)).\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nIn seeking pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Government bears the burden of shouing, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of flight, and that no condition or\ncombination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f);\nUnited States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nHouever, where, as here, the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including offenses\ninvolving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, 2422 or 2423, a statutory presumption arises\n“that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the\nperson as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, the defendant “bears a limited\nburden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward\nwith evidence that [s]he does not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\n433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the statutory\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page8oflil\nPage 8\n\npresumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it becomes a factor to be\nweighed and considered in deciding whether release is warranted. /d.\n\nWhere the Government seeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based on flight risk, the court must consider: (l)\n“the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2) “the weight of the evidence against the\nperson”; and (3) the “history and characteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nA <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing may be reopened “at any time before trial if the judicial officer finds\nthat information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of such person as required.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); see also United States v. Bush,\nNo. l8 Cr. 9o7 (PAC), 2o2l WL 37l782, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2o2l) (motion for reconsideration\nof bail requires defendant to shou “controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked—\nmaters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the\ncourt” (internal citation and quotations omited)).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nOn three occasions, this Court has correctly found that there are no conditions of release\nthat can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance, given the grave risk of flight that she\npresents. In three carefully reasoned decisions issued after lengthy briefing and argument, this\nCourt has concluded that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>; the strength of the Government’s proffered\nevidence; and the defendant’s history and characteristics, particularly her substantial international\nties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections abroad, ounership of at least\none foreign property of significant value, lack of candor about her finances, and “extraordinary\ncapacity to evade detection.” (First Order at 79-9l; Second Order at 7-2o; Third Order at 6-ll).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Pageloofll\nPage lo\ncompromised. (See, e.g., Dkt. 282 at 2 (finding “nothing in the record plausibly establishes that\ncurrent protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with\nher lawyers”)).\n\nFinally, in a single paragraph, the defendant argues that the Jencks Act and Giglio material\nshe has received “contradict the purported ‘strength’ of the government’s case.” (Def. Mot. 6). But\nthat claim is supported by only the most conclusory of assertions that “there is no independent\ncorroboration” for the victims’ statements and that they “demonstrate contamination and collusion\nfrom various sources.” (/d.). The defendant has made such arguments about the strength of the\nGovernment’s case before (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at l9; Dkt. 97 at 3o-33; Dkt. l7l at 7-8), and each\ntime the Court has rejected the defendant’s bail application. (See, e.g., Second Order at 9-lo\n(rejecting the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of its case at the bail\nhearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony”)). Moreover, since\nthe Court’s third <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order, the Court has also rejected the defendant’s pretrial motions to\ndismiss the charges (Dkt. 2o7, 3l7), the pendency of which the defendant had also claimed\nundermined the strength of the case (see, e.g., Dkt. l7l at 7-8), and a grand jury returned a\nsuperseding indictment charging additional counts based on an additional victim, and the\nGovernment intends to prove the existence of two additional victims at trial. Thus, the defendant’s\nlatest ipse dixit about the victims does not in fact “undermine the strength of the government’s\ncase.” (Def. Mot. 6). Quite the contrary, that the defendant is this close to trial and still cannot\nmake a more compelling argument about the strength of the case underscores what has been\napparent from the Government’s first proffer: the case is strong.\n\nThe defendant’s motion for reconsideration should be denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006308.jpg": "CeSasb: 2@2orOCRRSPAGN Denwment422 Abe 22l Paetpege afar 2\nee\n\nle U.S. Department of Justice\nANS o7 United States Atorney\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ms. Maxwell is not, and has never been, a flight risk. At every\nopportunity, Ms. Maxwell has vigorously asserted her innocence and her eagerness to face these\nunsubstantiated charges in court. She should be alloued to do so outside of the confines of the\nMDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial,\nnegatively impact her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.\n\nThe Court nou has the 35oo material and Giglio material which seriously undermine the\nstrength of the government’s case and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the\ngovernment cannot and does not even atempt to refute.

Never before that time and never again in the roughly\n2o-year period since the conduct underlying this case occurred has Ms. Maxwell ever been accused\nof a crime, much less a scheme to sexually abuse minors. The witnesses at trial testified about Ms.\nMaxwell’s facilitation of Epstein’s abuse, but Epstein was always the central figure: Epstein was\nthe mastermind, Epstein was the principal abuser, and Epstein orchestrated the crimes for his\npersonal gratification. Indeed, had Ghislaine Maxwell never had the profound misfortune of\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein over 3o years ago, she would not be here.\n\nEpstein avoided a significant sentence when he was first prosecuted in Florida for these\noffenses and then evaded any further punishment by dying a month after his arrest and <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nin New York. But this Court cannot sentence Ms. Maxwell as if she were a proxy for Epstein\nsimply because Epstein is no longer here.

SDNY’s focus was always on righting the wrongs resulting from\nthe Florida prosecution: Epstein was undercharged and under punished, Epstein never faced his\naccusers, and his accusers were denied justice. Epstein was the target and the focus of the\nprosecution until his death in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) in August 2ol9.\nEpstein’s 2ol9 Arrest and Aftermath\n\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in connection with an SDNY indictment. He\nwas detained in the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) until his untimely death in custody\non August l9, 2ol9. The highly publicized announcement of his arrest and <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> came as a\nrelief and vindication for women who had filed complaints against him. His capture and\nconfinement quelled public outrage at Epstein’s lenient Florida plea deal from October 2oo7 and\nthe lou sentence he received. Epstein’s death approximately one month after his arrest eliminated\nany prospect ofa trial, again shocking and disappointing his accusers. It also highlighted the failure\nof the U.S. government to ensure that an inmate in federal custody, in such a sensitive and high-\nprofile case, could be kept safe and alive to face trial.\n\nIn the face of strong media and public uproar follouing Epstein’s death, the government\nfaced an urgency to appease the renewed distress of Epstein’s accusers and to repair the tarnished\nreputations of the DOJ and BOP in whose custody Epstein died. There would be no trial for\nEpstein and no public vindication and justice for his accusers. The government nou had a huge\nhole to fill: Epstein’s empty chair.

The Court cannot\nheal the wounds caused by Epstein by heaping on Ms. Maxwell’s shoulders the pain of every one\nof his victims, the outrage of society, the public scorn of the community, and then driving her out\nof the community forever. While that may assuage the public and give the perception that “justice\nwas done,” that is not justice. That is scapegoating.

She had relocated alone,\nseparating from her family to safeguard her husband and two young stepchildren and to secure the\npersonal safety of her family and herself. At that time, Ms. Maxwell was the target of numerous\ndeath threats and threats of violence and was being hunted by the press. One media outlet even\noffered a $lo,ooo bounty for information about her whereabouts. Tragically, this experience was\nnot new for Ms. Maxwell. Decades earlier, when Ms. Maxwell was just a child and her father was\na Member of Parliament, U.K. authorities found a “hit list” of potential kidnapping/assassination\ntargets in a safehouse used by the Irish Republican Army. Ms. Maxwell’s name was first on the\nlist.

Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having legitimate reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender. Ms. Maxwell’s presence in New Hampshire\nwas driven solely by the need to protect herself and her family from threats of physical harm and\nfrom the unprecedented and escalating press and public vilification she had to endure since\nEpstein’s death.\n\nOn July 6, 2o2o, exactly a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell was ordered\ndetained in the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) based on the government’s assertion that\nshe posed “an extreme risk of flight” and that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.”® Each of four bail applications\nwere denied on the elusive claim of flight risk, despite the unprecedented financial collateral and\nrestrictions proposed to secure a hefty bond for an almost 6o-year-old woman who, the government\nconceded, posed no danger to the community, and who had never atempted to flee the United\nStates.

On\nApril 2o, 2o22, almost four months after trial, she was abruptly placed in general population, and\nthe charade of her pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was revealed: Her unusual <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was intended to help\nredeem DOJ and BOP reputations tarnished by Epstein’s untimely death in custody and to ensure\nthat Epstein’s accusers would have their day in court.

Just recently, Ms. Maxwell was the target of a credible death threat from a\nfellou inmate. On information and belief, one of the female inmates in Ms. Maxwell’s housing\nunit told at least three other inmates that she had been offered money to murder Ms. Maxwell and\nthat she planned to strangle her in her sleep. The inmate who made the threat has been moved to\nthe SHU, presumably to protect Ms. Maxwell.’ This incident reflects the brutal reality that there\nare numerous prison inmates who would not hesitate to kill Ms. Maxwell — whether for money,\nfame, or simple “street cred.” Ms. Maxwell has effectively traded the stress of flashlight checks\nevery l5 minutes in the middle of the night while in isolation for the equivalent stress of having\nto sleep with one eye open - for as long as she is housed with other inmates.

From the outset, Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> were extraordinarily\nrestrictive and unjustifiable in view of her personal circumstances and were manifestly\nunreasonable and unnecessary in view of meaningful alternatives available in the MDC. There is\nno explanation for her extraordinary conditions of confinement other than calculated efforts by the\nDOJ, BOP, MDC, and prosecutors to prevent another Epstein debacle and to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell would fill the chair vacated by Epstein’s demise.

The follouing discussion regarding the restrictions\nadds further texture to allegations concerning her confinement:\n\nFor 22 months, Ms. Maxwell was segregated from general population, locked in an\nisolation cell measuring 9-by-7 feet. While confined to that cell, she was restricted from moving\n'S The transfer was made without any notice to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel or consultation with Ms. Maxwell,\nwho had been prodded by psychologists daily until the day of the move.

During daytime hours she was isolated in a larger\nspace. Atno time did she have contact with any other inmate. She was watched round-the-clock\nby a security detail dedicated exclusively to guard her as she was consistently monitored by video\nsurveillance. Her security detail rotated every two weeks and consisted of high-level BOP staffers\nrecruited from facilities outside New York who were instructed to guard a high-profile, high-\nsecurity inmate on suicide watch.'* Ms. Maxwell was subject to constantly changing rules and\nwhims. Her only source of information was from the guards who controlled her. They became the\nsource of information regarding rules, regulations, and opportunities.

The procedures in place deprived\nMs. Maxwell of any privacy and prevented uninterrupted sleep.

The Supreme Court defines\n“unusual” as “something different from that which is generally done.”!® Under an original\nunderstanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause (U.S. Const. amend. vi), “a\npunishment is cruel and unusual if it is overly harsh in light of longstanding practice.”!?

Quite the contrary. The policies and actions\nimplemented to detain Ms. Maxwell violated clearly established rights of inmates to be free from\npunishment and unreasonable searches. Courts have been confronted with cases challenging\nconditions of confinement in the MDC. See Turkman v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 2l8 (2d Cir. 2ol5), which\ninvolved many of the same challenges to conditions of confinement.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was far more arduous and constituted\na more serious penalty than conventional <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is general population. While the hardship of\nimprisonment is normally measured in quantitative terms, i.e., by the length of the prison term, the\nhardship and deprivations experienced by Ms. Maxwell also had a qualitative aspect. The\ndifference between Ms. Maxwell’s isolation and typical prison conditions is so pronounced that\nthey differ not only in degree but in nature. This distinction demands a different calibration\nwhereby each day spent in isolation - especially where isolation is not based on any behavior\nmanifested by the inmate and while the inmate is presumed innocent - should result in an enhanced\ntime-served credit.\nIncarceration During the Pandemic Supports a Well-Recognized Sentence Reduction\n\nCourts in this district and elsewhere have acknouledged COVID hardship as a basis for\ndounward variances from the guidelines.

Excepting inmates charged with terrorism, disciplined for severe institutional infractions and violence,\nand Mexican drug lord “El Chapo”, Ms. Maxwell has been subjected to the most unusual and punitive form\nof pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Accordingly, it is appropriate to make a sentencing submission that exposes the\nunfairness of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in the hope that the government (e.g., DOJ, BOP, and prosecutors) not repeat\nsuch disparate treatment and courts recognize that it cannot abandon its supervisory pouers to permit BOP\nbureaucrats to exercise administrative measures without accountability.\n\n* “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\ninflicted.” U.S. Const. amend xi.\n“USSG, Part A, §§ 2-5 (2o2l).\n*> See Solem v.

The most basic objective is to “combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing\nsystem” through (i) honesty in sentencing (that is, removing the pouer of the parole commission to reduce\nthe term to be served); (ll) reasonable uniformity in sentencing - by reducing the wide disparity of sentences\nfor similar offenses; and (i) proportionate sentences.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and her current <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nin general population.

Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees.

She has endeavored to contribute to society (e.g., by\nbecoming an EMT, developing a platform so that people in remote areas could receive quality\nmedical assistance, helping launch the Clinton Global Initiative, creating TerraMar, providing\nGED tutoring for inmates in her unit) and will continue to do so throughout her sentence and when\nshe rejoins the community beyond prison walls. She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been associated with her.\n\nShe had a difficult, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather.

She reported that she often\nrefuses to go to recreation to avoid being searched, which has negatively impacted her physical\nhealth because she is unable to get fresh air or exercise. She was reportedly denied an extra\nblanket in the winter and on more than one occasion an officer took one of her blankets from\nher after her request for an extra blanket was granted. She further reported that she was not\nprovided a proper food regimen for the first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she\nwas provided with small, inadequate portions or roten food.

Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 48 of 55\n\ncell into a day room for thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. In the day room, the defendant\nhad exclusive access to a telephone, a television, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys. Those conditions are a far cry from the 23-hour-per-day\nlockdoun experienced by inmates in SAMs, and indeed, a far cry from many inmates in general\npopulation during the COVID-l9 pandemic, who were often locked in their cells for significant\nperiods of time to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe defendant baselessly claims that her conditions of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> “thwart[ed] her ability to\nparticipate in and prepare her defense.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 25). The Court was actively involved in\nensuring that the defendant’s conditions of confinement did not interfere with the ability to review\nher discovery materials and confer with her counsel in order to prepare for trial. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys. Maxwell also had as much, if not more, time as any\nother MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys. She received five hours of VTC calls with\nher counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney VTC calls per week, and she had\naccess to in-person visits with her atorneys.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page5oof55\nstaff conduct flashlight checks every 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit\nand conduct flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at\nirregular intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nThe defendant’s repeated claims about jail food and her weight should be rejected out of\nhand as a basis for a dounward variance. Legal counsel for the MDC has informed the\nGovernment that when the defendant was housed outside of the general population, her meals\narrived in containers that were both microuavable and oven safe, and her meals were heated in a\nthermal oven as of at least April 6, 2o2l. As the Government previously informed the Court in\nresponse to the defendant’s complaints about her weight, during her time at the MDC, the\ndefendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and the l4os. Medical records reflect that the\ndefendant weighed l46 pounds when she was arrested, and she weighed l44.5 pounds when she\nwas last weighed in April 2o22. In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not\ntrue.\n\nAt botom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come doun to the vast gulf\nbetween the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest\nand <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> on July 2, 2o2o. Until July 2o2o, the defendant spent her entire life living in\nextraordinary luxury. Her childhood and adolescence were filled with wealth and privilege. That\naccess to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who\nprovided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,\nhouse staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that relationship, the defendant\nremained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and ouning multiple homes. It is no\nwonder, then, that she found jail jarring. Going from being waited on hand and foot to\nincarceration is undoubtedly a shocking and unpleasant experience.

The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay\nof this case (7.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiffs claims against Maxwell), as a\npartial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff's claims\nand would add unnecessary cost to the litigation. (See id., at l-2.) The Co-Executors also\npointed out that, if this mater were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a resolution of\nher claims through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Compensation Program’’)\nthat has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases\nbefore the Court to seek voluntary stays of their lawsuits. (See id., at 2-3.)\n\nBy leter dated August 27, 2o2o, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the requested stay, arguing\nthat the relevant factors weigh against granting the requested relief. (See generally Leter to the\nCourt from Robert Glassman, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Glassman Ltr.”) (Dkt. 78).)\nIn her opposition, Plaintiff contended, inter alia, that Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> should pose no real\nimpediment to her defense of this action, suggesting that Maxwell, who filed her motion for a\nstay only after she had first sought discovery from Plaintiff in this case, “appear[ed] to want to\ngain an unfair advantage by acquiring as much information as she [could] about Plaintiff without\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019453.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl H2de Hayes of l3\nin her ability to seek redress for the sexual assaults and other tortious conduct on which her\nclaims are based, as, during the pendency of any stay, she would still be able to participate in that\nprogram.\n\nOverall, and despite Plaintiffs assertion that a stay would work to her disadvantage, this\nCourt finds that any generalized prejudice that she would suffer as the result of a stay is not\nsufficient to counterbalance the other factors that the Court should consider, which all heavily\nfavor a stay.\n\n4, The Interests of the Defendant\n\nThe private interests of Maxwell, and the burden that she would face in proceeding with\ndiscovery in the civil action at this time are significant. As already noted, if civil discovery were\nto proceed, Maxwell would have to make the difficult decision of whether to assert her Fifth\nAmendment privilege — a decision that could adversely impact her position in one or the other of\nthe cases she is defending. See Louis Vuiton, 676 F.3d at 97. Also, due to heightened\nrestrictions at the MDC during the COVID-l9 pandemic (restrictions of which this Court takes\njudicial notice), this Court understands that counsel has had difficulty, and will likely continue to\nhave difficulty, meeting with Maxwell and arranging for her to review documents or otherwise to\nconfer for the purpose of preparing a defense to this civil case. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.,\nat 5; see also 9/4/2o Menninger Reply Ltr., at 2-3.)\n\nThis Court finds that not only the existence of the criminal prosecution against Maxwell,\nbut also the particularly (and unusually) restrictive circumstances of her current <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, would\nnecessarily make it harder for Maxwell to participate fully in the discovery process in this action,\nand would cause her undue prejudice, weighing strongly in favor of a stay.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool9453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019463.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document GbNOSKHACe NRser 95Ea8o, Page6 of l25\nEmail: Lara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\n\nDate Filed\n\no6/29/2o2o l | SEALED INDICTMENT as to Sealed Defendant l (l) count(s) l, 2, 3, 4, 5-6.

I mean I knou that it\n\nwould only be to help herself but the public deserves to knou who was involved\nbesides her and Jeffrey Epstein, and only she knous that.\n\nThe violations of Rule 23.l did not stop after Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nFollouing the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing on July l4, 2o2o, Mr. Boies, counsel for one of the accusers\nwho spoke at the hearing, commented on the content of the hearing. As reported by Bloomberg,\nMr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all\nin violation of subsections (l), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule:\n\nThat’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who\n\nrepresents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused\n\nby Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her\n\ncredibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.\n\n‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying\n\nto blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so\n\ncontrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just\n\ngoing to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were\nrepresenting her.’\n\nBoies said he was confident Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if\n\nthere’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not\n\nto grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused\n\nme.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies\n\nsaid that Farmer was a l6-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met\n\nMaxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group\n\nof high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said.\n\n‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are\n\nfraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.”®\n\n® htps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghislaine-maxwell-may-play-the-victim-card-in-trial-\ndefense-l.l46563l\n\nApp.o35\nDOJ-OGR-oool9494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019495.jpg": "CGsedl ZDaO S BOs ATTEN (hdc WRG 2o2 F i62l /PAg eethei6l 257\nThe Honorable Alison J.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release\non bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court\nDENIES the Defendant’s motion.\nIn light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that\nshould not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose\nany redactions to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by reference to\nthe Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir.\n2oo6). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted,\nthe Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.\nThis Order provides the botom line of the Court’s resolution. On July l4, 2o2o, this\nCourt conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted\nbecause the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance at future proceedings. Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if\nthe Court finds “that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool97l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019714.jpg": "Case L2G d4lo633o-ccImeDozuie h?

In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019867.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN ISdtuM Ent /2o FilesOOAH2o2 P a hag e426ioLo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019868.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN IOSdtuUM Ent /2o FilesOOAH2o2 P ahageb26ioLo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9868\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019869.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-CoGGoR7FeIN 3DacOMENt 2o 2F il Go OFZoo/26a Gedgect 26o.o\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“|The steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019870.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DAcOMENl2o 2Fil Gd OFZGH/ 26a Geddeo’ 26oo\n\ndate of the amendment,! to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor\nvictim. See United States v. Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because\nCongress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the\nprevious statute was still running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis,\nNo. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same). Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool987o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019872.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DacOMENl 2o 2Fil Go OF ZOH/ 26a Gedgecd 26o.o\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9879\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019880.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/So Pages of 26o\n\nBackground. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019881.jpg": "Cast F-26-C2oDSSOASN Bocturhert l8 Heo PA Ooo Pager of 26o\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool988l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019884.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDISSCUAUN Distant l &Pitdd BPP FOSO Pagero St 2o\nprior <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-l9.

Nevertheless, the Court noted that “inmates may be at a heightened risk of\ncontracting COVID-l9 should an outbreak develop,” and, based in part on this changed\ncircumstance, ordered the defendant released. /d.\n\nSince the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-l9 risks to inmates have\nincreased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-l9 in correctional\nfacilities.

The Stephens opinion\nprovides yet another independent basis that, we submit, requires Ms. Maxwell’s release: if she is\ndetained, her ability to meet with her atorneys and prepare for her defense will be significantly\nimpaired and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nIn Stephens, the Court found that this factor required the defendant’s release under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(4), which provides for temporary release based on a determination that such\nrelease is “necessary for preparation of the person’s defense.” Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at\n*3.

The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42,\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government .. ..” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64. These factors are not present in this case.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9897\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019899.jpg": "Cas 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DStamteHPl &-Pitdd BPP POH Page DS St 2o\nEB The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance.

Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under\nwhich a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed\nsecurity guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original).

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk.

The Defendant’s Victims Seek <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.

Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019915.jpg": "CaSade2Oter)d3GoouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL8) 26a deanfect 2 GP l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million.

To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed.

In the reply brief, we get a new allegation that an\n\n8 SDAR, a foreign filing was made in 2ol8 and 2ol9, disclosing\n\n9 that our client had a foreign bank account.

What I am saying is, when you have a\n\n8 client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the\n\n9 country despite an investigation, and the government instead\n\nlo chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early\nll instances your access to the client.

They have told us that there are two\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019996.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel37 of 2oo 74\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was appropriate in that case on risk of flight alone.\n2 And, again, that conduct was -- at that point significant time\n3 had passed, and Jeffrey Epstein was not a foreign citizen.\n\n4 I want to respond with respect to the NPA. At this\n\n5 point, your Honor, the defense has articulated no legal basis\n\n6 to suggest that the defendant is shielded by the nonprosecution\n7 agreement, and it simoly doesn't make sense that the decision\n\n8 in this case is somehou tactical to avoid concerns about the\n\n9 NPA, when the government charged Jeffrey Epstein with conduct\nlo that fell within the scope of the time period within the\n\nll nonprosecution agreement and stated before the court in\n\nl2 connection with bail proceedings in that mater that this is\n\nl3 the government's strong view that that agreement does not bind\nl4 this office whatsoever with respect to any kind of conduct or\nl5 any kind of individual. That agreement does not bind this\n\nl6 office whatsoever.\n\nl7 Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to\nl8 evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the\n\nl9 circumstances.

A finding of dangerousness, if\n\n9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing\nlo evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be\nll supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nl2 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is\n\nl3 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal\nl4 law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or\n\nl5 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance\nl6 of the person as required. That's citing l8 U.S.C. 3l42(a) (3).\nl7 The Second Circuit has explained that, ina\n\nl8 presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a Limited\n\nl9 burden of production, not a burden of persuasion, to rebut the\n2o presumption by coming forward with evidence that she does not\nal pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.\n22 Furthermore, once a defendant has met her burden of production\n23 relating to these two factors, the presumption favoring\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to\n25 be considered among those weighed by the district court.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n* Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84):\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “\\clircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83): and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\nreasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\nairest and her initial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing.

(Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\ndemonstrate Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail.

Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020056.jpg": "Caseasb:2o-O8oo88oHAEN ISAC UMENT/ D2 FileebRa3o/PtagPage a2267o45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.\"\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel.

In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020068.jpg": "Caseabe? o-c6o8BG+ANt DEcuMEr? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Boat 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

(Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> analysis when the Government\nseeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020070.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctIMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FHgPagetl Oost 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, “the\ndefendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut\nthat presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”\nUnited States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes,\n254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)). The act of producing such evidence, houever, “does not\neliminate the presumption favoring <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” /d. Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to\nbe considered among those weighed by the district court,’ while the Government retains the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\nat 436.\n\nWhen the Court has already issued a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was\nnot knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the\ndefendant. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an atempt to reopen\na <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”\nUnited States v. Petrov, l5 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26,\n2ol5). Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered\neven where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the\noriginal hearing,” United States v. Roue, o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 2l, 2oo3), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020071.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEciuMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FgPagetlisef 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020072.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8BtANAt BEctuMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPagetl Pat 36\ndefendant faces up to 35 years of incarceration, and may very well spend the remainder of her\nnatural life in prison. The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020075.jpg": "Cageab2o-ce6oBaGAdsnt Becument loo2 Filed6R238/2thg Page tl Sts 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020076.jpg": "Caseab2o-cre6o BROAN DEctIMer? loo2 Filed6R2a38/?gPagetl Goof 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020082.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel 26st 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020084.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8BGANt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tgPaAgePasaf 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020085.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBGlANt DEctuMerf loo2 Filed6Ra38/?tgPageP Staf 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was still warranted. (See Tr. 87).\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020086.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGlANAt DEctIMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?HgPaAgeG6af 36\nthis Court already weighed in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and confirmation of that deception only\nreemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions.\n\nNou, the defense has submited a financial report that reflects the defendant has\napproximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial\nServices. (Def. Ex. O). Accepting the financial report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. In\nother words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would\nstill have millions of dollars at her disposal. She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access. The financial report only addresses the\ndefendant’s assets without detailing her income at all. The defendant has similarly provided the\nCourt with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective\n® In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in\nunrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other\nitems. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the\nretainer paid to her atorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled.\n\n7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents\nof the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond\namount. These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as\na result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020088.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8BGHANt DEctIMe ri loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPage staf 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020089.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBRGHANAt BEctuMer? loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel Saf 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020090.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEciuMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tHgPageBOet 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020091.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BGAN DEctiMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBisef 36\n(Tr. 87).

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.

Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, weighing\nfurther in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020094.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGANnt DEctIMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBataf 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020129.jpg": "CaGade2ZOter)d3GouAuNt Bibsutre/tl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9g FAgef A Ob 22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nl This Opinion & Onder will be temporarily sealed in order to allou the parties to propose\nredactions to sensitive or confidential information.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020130.jpg": "CaGade2o ep) o36Go4AUt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2eg Pagef 3 Gb 22\nDefendant did not appeal the Court’s determination that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was required, and she has been\nincarcerated at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center since that time.\n\nII. Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“|A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”). Nonetheless, “‘the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020131.jpg": "CaSade2o ep) o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitrentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget 4 Gb 22\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’”” English, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting\nMercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986)\n(“The government retains the burden of persuasion |in a presumption case].”). Even when “a\ndefendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> does\nnot disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district\ncourt.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o 9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail\nhearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and\nthat has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(f). But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “|a|s the court has already held one <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v. Havens, 487\nF. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing because the\nnew information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant until trial).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020132.jpg": "CaGade2o ep) o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l22 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Pages 5 Gb 22\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other\nperson and the community.” A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”’); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020133.jpg": "CaGade2ZOtehd3GouAuNt BibSutre/ntl l2o lF kG 3228o/2eg Falgef d O6 22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services. Jd. at 2 3.\nFurthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who\nwould prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or\nPretrial Services and who would escort her when she is authorized to leave. Jd. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law enforcement prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25—29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020134.jpg": "CaGadeZOtepQ)d3GOuAuNt Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2o9o Faget 7l Ob 22\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020135.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAuNit Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9o Fagef d Ob 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020136.jpg": "CaGade2o epQ)o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget J Gb 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020137.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag P Age fl O6af 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020142.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pag ef hoof 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020143.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pad ef Goof 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nC. Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020146.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagel bof 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020147.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagehbos 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk.

The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion.

She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020158.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN ZetuMAent /LOO l FileasaesFaigePagd Bast 9\nassure her appearance as required.

The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020164.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef 4 Ob 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020165.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Ragef 5 Ob 9\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020167.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5l , BilEGH3lo 972 e Rage 7l Gb 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020180.jpg": "CaSast: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePageBlGhl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020181.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN At uMMent/LVP l Fileasasy2 372l9 ePagebl l65l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020195.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN At uPAheht/LOP l Filecsas22F2Ig ePage 4l6l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020198.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas22F2I9 ePagei7 l6l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020199.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 272l9 ePageBlGhl2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020202.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Plageoct l Ob l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o2o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020206.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8; Co68OosAeIN 3D6cOrherit459l , Bled 52ol G/ahe Paget 2 ob 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied.

Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2. Extensive pretrial litigation folloued until the\ncase was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2o2o. Doc. 63. The Court held a pretrial\nconference on March lo, 2o2o and testimonial writs were issued. Docs. l27 and l43. Just days\nlater, houever, the devastating extent of the global COVID-l9 pandemic became clear and the\nChief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil\nand criminal jury trials set for the follouing month. See In the Mater of: Court Operations in\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020211.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAt BU l FROG O22o6/2ag Fagen’ 6l6\nLight of the Coronavirus Outbreak, 2o-MC-oooo4-9 (D.N.M.

See Jn the\nMater of: Superseding Administrative Order 2o-MC-oooo4-49, 2l-MC-oooo4-o4 (D.N.M. Jan.\nl5, 2o2l) (Johnson, C.J.) (continuing the suspension of all civil and criminal jury trials through at\nleast February 28, 2o2l).\n\nIn the intervening ll months, Mr. Robertson has remained in custody. During that time\nperiod, the Court set and then continued several trial dates due to the pandemic, including dates in\nDecember 2o2o and February 2o2l. See, e.g, Doc. 27l. Mr. Robertson’s trial will nou be reset\nfor April 5, 2o2l, and the Court is hopeful that he will finally get his day in court after the extreme\nand unprecedented delay he has endured. Complicating maters, houever, is the fact that the\npandemic and the resulting passage of time has led to a recent and significant change in Mr.\nRobertson’s defense team: both of his original atorneys withdrew from the case in January of this\nyear. Doc. 295. As a result, the atorneys with which he will be going to trial in two months were\nappointed in September 2o2o and January 2o2l. Docs. l97 and 293. Although the Court would\nnot have granted the appointments if it were not sure that Mr. Robertson’s new atorneys would be\nready for trial this April, they nevertheless face the daunting task of earning their client’s trust,\npreparing for trial, and reviewing three years’ worth of litigation in a mater of months.\n\nMr. Robertson first asked the Court to consider his release in July of last year. Doc. l8l.\nHe argued that his continued pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> posed a risk to his health because his compromised\nimmune system makes him especially vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-l9.

He also argued that there were conditions of release that would satisfy the requirements of\nthe Bail Reform Act, including the designation of his father as a third-party custodian. /d. at 9-\nlo.

It explained\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020214.jpg": "Casse :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesumePAtl BOR l FROG O22o6 24g Aagee t6l6\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020215.jpg": "Cased 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BU l FROG O22o6/2agFAageo’ 6l6\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020219.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdl BA62 Filke662o6/Phg Peoye dill66l6\ncombination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the community. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020220.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecyuMdi BA62 Filke62o6/PhgPHye di2l66l6\nComplicating maters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense atorneys have\nrecently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current atorneys have been appointed within\nthe past six months (one in the last three weeks). The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020223.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivent DecyMdl BA62 Filke62o6/PhgPeye di5l66l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\nunavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\naccommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”).

Among other things,\nthe Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three from l994 through 2oo4 and specifically identified a fourth\nvictim of those conspiracies.

Judge Nathan explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, are\n\nserious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\n\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\n\nincluding multiple corroborating and _ corroborated\n\nwitnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a\n\ncountry that does not extradite its citizens); and the\n\nDefendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family\n\nto whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully\n\ncandid about her financial situation.\n\n(Ud. at 2).\n\nl8. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s claim that the Government\noverstated the strength of its case at the bail hearing, finding that Maxwell “too easily\ndiscredits the witness testimony.” (/d. at 9-lo). Judge Nathan credited the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020246.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel2 of 25\n\nparties to support Maxwell’s bond did not alter this conclusion because “the amount\nof wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly\nenable her to compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses.” (/d. at l8). Judge\nNathan also rejected Maxwell’s proposed conditions of release to a relative’s\ncustody and private security guards, reiterating her concern regarding Maxwell’s\n“extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\n22. Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s\nargument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere\nwith her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).\nMaxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other\ninmates at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as\nmuch, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). Judge Nathan\nreiterated that she would continue to ensure that Maxwell is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o\nn.3).\n\nD. = The Third Bail Application\n\n23. On February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed a third bail application,\n\nproposing two additional bail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020247.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel3 of 25\ncitizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new\naccount to be overseen by a monitor. (Ex. I). After considering multiple writen\nsubmissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another writen\nopinion. (Ex. L).\n\n24. Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was warranted\nin light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7).\n\n25. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument that the strength of\nthe evidence was diminished by Maxwell’s pending pre-trial motions. (/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll). Judge\nNathan concluded, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020249.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel5 of 25\nARGUMENT\nThe District Court Properly Denied Maxwell’s Motions for Bail and\nTemporary Release\n\n27. Judge Nathan did not clearly err when she determined that\nMaxwell is a risk of flight and that no conditions would reasonably assure her\nappearance in court. Nor did Judge Nathan abuse her discretion or clearly err by\ndenying Maxwell’s request for temporary release.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n28. In seeking pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Government bears the burden\nof shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure\nher presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d\n63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\n29. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In\nsuch a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of\npersuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020250.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel6 of 25\nCir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the\nstatutory presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it\nbecomes a factor to be weighed and considered in deciding whether release is\nwarranted. /d.\n\n3o. Where the Government seeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n3l. This Court generally applies “deferential review to a district\ncourt’s order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir.\n2ol9). It reviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight\nand whether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll);\nUnited States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. l987), and will reverse only if\n“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been commited,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n32. Once a defendant has been ordered detained, a judicial officer\nmay “permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States\nmarshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020251.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel7/ of 25\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l). The defendant bears the burden\nof shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough,\n82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No. 2o Cr. l26\n(LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o). This Court has not\nresolved whether it reviews a district court’s temporary release decision for abuse of\ndiscretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852, 853 n.3\n(2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nl. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Bail\n\n33. Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020252.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel8 of 25\ninternational ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections\nabroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value, lack of candor\nabout her finances, and “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex. D at 79-\n9l; Ex. H at 7-2o; Ex. L at 6-ll). Maxwell does not come close to identifying clear\nerror.\n\n34. Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue\nreliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. l9-\n2l). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine,\n2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not\nsubstitutes for trial or even for discovery. Often the opposing parties simply describe\nto the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce it.”\nId.; see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, l49 F.\nApp’x 4o, 42-43 (2d Cir. 2oo5); United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9, 32l n.7\n(2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Vondete, 5 F. App’x 73, 76 (2d Cir. 2ool); Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll45.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020254.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020255.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2l of 25\n\n38. At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications. V/d. at 2o n.3). Judge Nathan continued to oversee\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020257.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page23 of 25\nfive hours of video-teleconference calls with her counsel every weekday. (Gov’t Ex.\nA at l8).\n\n4o. Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” United States v. Chambers, No. 2o Cr. l35 (JMF),\n2o2o WL l53o746, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o). Here, that balance emphatically\nfavors <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, given Judge Nathan’s repeated findings about risk of flight and the\nsubstantial accommodations made to ensure Maxwell’s ability to prepare her\ndefense.\n\n4l. The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this conclusion.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex. D at 89-9o; Ex. H at 2l), but she nou\nhas been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at l9, 2l). And while some district courts\nhave ordered temporary release based in part on the COVID-l9 pandemic, each of\nthese discretionary decisions rests on its particular facts, as Judge Nathan was well-\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o257\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020260.jpg": "_  CaSede2dternQd36ouAuMnt Dibeumentvz72o Ailed ll/23/26acRagef Lat 2\n<S U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o26o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020262.jpg": ".

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020263.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep o33o4AUNt SieQutrenZ7Bo 2Ailed@ l2/o 26aRadgef 22f 2\nPage 2\nsearching (e.g., weekly body scan, l5-minute interval flashlight checks at night, and open-mouth\ninspection) despite being surveilled 24/7 by a dedicated three-guard security detail and two\ncameras; and the reason she is not being moved to the day room, which we understood was the\noriginal plan (and would reduce searching).

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to discovery. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\ndiscovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020272.jpg": "_ CaSede2oteb®d33ouAEnnt Dibeutrenvl2e lFiked 92ool /2agPiagef Lat 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material.

This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal counsel through those communications.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC.

At times the stench in Ms.\nMaxwell’s isolation cell has been overwhelming due to overflouing of toilets in the cellblock\nabove. Due to lack of privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from using the toilet in the isolation cell\nand, as directed by the guards, she flushes frequently to avoid plumbing problems.

The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court’s\nOrder, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.\n\nMDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a mater of course throughout the facility\nfor the safety and security of the inmates at the institution. During these flashlight checks, MDC\nstaff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that\nthe inmate is present in the cell, breathing, and not in distress. MDC staff conduct flashlight checks\nevery 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the “SHU”) and conduct\nflashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular\nintervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nWith respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes\nbecause the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020358.jpg": "CaSede2ot epQo33ouAUNt Boeutient/2722 lFilsa S2o7 /2agPAagef Zot 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Regardless, the\nMDC would never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in general\npopulation, knouing the difficulties it would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from assault and\nextortion by other inmates given that they do not protect her from physical abuse by guards.

As the Government has explained in oral and writen proffers,\nthe allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of\nthree different victim-witnesses. (See, e.g., Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-lo). Each\nvictim-witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-\nwitnesses, but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence,\nincluding flight records, diary entries, and other evidence. (See Ex. A at 5; Ex. F\nat lo-l2).\n\nll. Maxwell has made three separate bail applications to the District\nCourt, each of which was thoroughly briefed. Judge Nathan denied all three\napplications in careful and thorough decisions.\n\nl2. First, after receiving extensive writen submissions from the\nparties (Ex. A, B, C), Judge Nathan held a bail hearing on July l4, 2o2o, at which\nshe heard lengthy oral argument and received statements from two victims. Judge\nNathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis of risk of flight and\nexplained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling. (Ex. D at 79-9l). In reaching\nthis decision, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense\nhere weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>” (id. at 82), “[t]he government’s evidence at this\nearly juncture of the case appears strong” (id.), and Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight (id. at 83).

In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5.

It should be denied.\nA. Applicable Law\n\n23. When seeking pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, the Government bears the\nburden of shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a\nrisk of flight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably\nassure her presence in court.

Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. 8§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required....” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).\nIn such a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden\nof persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose .. . a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436\n(2d Cir. 2ool).\n\n25. Where the Government seeks <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020372.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel4 of 24\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n26. This Court applies “deferential review to a district court’s order\nof <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It\nreviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight and\nwhether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll);\nUnited States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. l987), and will reverse only if\n“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been commited,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n27. Once a defendant has been ordered detained, a judicial officer\nmay “permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States\nmarshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).. The defendant bears the\nburden of shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v.\nScarborough, 82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No.\n2o Cr. l26 (LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o).

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test.

United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non—party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for\nhis client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on\nbehalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime.

The Court will take no further action based on the April 2l,\n2o2l leter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non—party\nasserting that interest.

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted\nin part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to\ncertain questions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to\nensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications.

And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

In an Opinion and\nOrder concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's\nmotion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal.

Under this test, the\nCourt must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\"\n(ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i)\nbalance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir.\nl995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that\nthe Defendant's leter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function\nand useful in the judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for\npurposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"),\n44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put\nforthincluding, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the\nletersfavor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to\ndocket the redacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons\noutlined in the Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

From that day, Maxwell was held in solitary\nconfinement in the Brooklyn <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center. As COVID raged, the District\nCourt denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate\nMaxwell’s deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell\nwas so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her\noun defense, much less to testify.\n\nAs trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both\nscale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a conviction was\nenormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with\nits terms and refused to dismiss the case as time-barred. She precluded Maxwell\nfrom presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that\nwas central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2oo6 FBI investigation, the terms\nof the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants’ civil atorneys in both\nthe VCP and the Government’s investigation.\n\nThe trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane,\nKate, and Carolyn), were permited to testify under pseudonyms. The result\ntransformed the trial into a form of Kabuki theater designed to remind the jury at\nevery turn that these adult women were being protected because their privacy\ninterests, and not Maxwell’s constitutional right to a public trial, were paramount.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021178.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document aA 3536o38, Page6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 348\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021204.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page32 of 258\nSA-3o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 348\n\nB. The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021227.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NR 3536o38, Page55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021261.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O87 3536o38, Page89 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 348\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.?® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, ““You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means .. . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n38 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like... this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n99 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021272.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA_o8 3536o38, Pageloo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!!° Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\ntime in state custody.\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'’ This morning Jay\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\neligible.\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On the\nfirst one he gets l2 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets\nHs FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permiting the\ngovernment to withhold the requested records. See 5 U.S.C. § 552.\nae Sentences falling within Zones A or B of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines permit probation or confinement\nalternatives to imprisonment.\n72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021273.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA.99 3536o38, Pagelol of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time. I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end. I have selected tomorrou at 5:oo because it\ngives them enough time to really negotiate an agreement if they are\nserious about it, and if not, it gives me one day before the Jewish\nholiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday . . . [September 25] , when I\nplan to [file charges], and it gives the office sufficient time to review\nthe indictment package.\nDo you concur?\nA few minutes later, the incoming West Palm Beach manager emailed Lourie, suggesting that\nLourie “talk to Epstein and close the deal.” l!®\n\nWithin moments, Lourie replied to the manager, with a copy to Villafafia, reporting that he\nhad just spoken with Lefkouitz and agreed “to two fed[eral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap)\nwith nonbinding recommendation for l8 months. When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021281.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo7 3536o38, Pagelo9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nfacility. !?”\nls Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl28 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nWa The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021310.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel38 of 258\nSA-l36\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed.\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.’”* At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021317.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l43 3536o38, Pagel45 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff?s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “‘as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!®° At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\n86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\ntsi The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was ‘fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021394.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page222 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction.

As I have said in many\n\ng sentencing proceedings since the pandemic began, the conditions\nlo in the MDC have been extremely difficult for all inmates as a\nll result. There have been extended periods of lockdoun, health\nl2 risks, and the lack of access to legal and social visits and\n\nLs programming and the like. Conditions at the MDC are, to put it\nl4 mildly, not what they should be, and serving time during the\n\nl5 pandemic has been more difficult than serving time before it.\nl6 As I have in other sentencings, I take into account this in\n\nl7 imposing an appropriate sentence. I also take into account\n\nl8 that, as a high-profile defendant charged and convict of sex\n\nl9 offenses against minors, Ms. Maxwell faces security risks and\n2o has endured additional isolation and surveillance beyond the\nal typical pretrial detainee.\n22 That said, I largely reject the defense's primary\n23 writen contention that Ms. Maxwell has been singled out for\n24 uniquely harsh and punishing treatment.

Ghislaine Maxwell,\nDocket No. 22-l426\nArgument date: March l2, 2o23\nDear Ms. Wolfe:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 28(), to inform this Court of United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d\nl52 (2d Cir. 2ol9).\n\nIn Watkins, this Court explained that the portion of the Bail Reform Act, l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42()(l)(E), that required a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing for “any felony .. . that in-\nvolves a minor victim ... .” permits a court to conduct a “conduct-specific inquiry in\nwhich the judicial officer may look beyond the elements of the charged offense to con-\nsider the actual conduct underlying the arrestee’s charged offense.” 94o F.3d at l65,\nl67. Because that phrase “refers to a ‘minor victim,” it “suggest[s] factual details\nsurrounding the charged conduct.” Id. at l66. The Court also noted the absence of a\ntextual trigger for the categorical approach like “that has as an element.” Id. at l66\nn.7o. The Court further explained that its conclusion was reinforced by legislative\nhistory, namely, the inclusion of Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) in a statute intended to “afford\nminor victims of crime the greatest degree of protection.” Id. at l66.\n\nThe Court contrasted Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) with another portion of the Act that\ncontains the word “involves” but requires use of the categorical approach, because\nthat text “refers, variously, to a ‘crime, an ‘offense, and a ‘felony,” indicating an em-\nphasis on the nature of the legal charge rather than “factual details.” Id. (quoting l8\nU.S.C. § 3l82(f)(l) (discussing “a case that involves ...a crime of violence . . .”); see\nid. at l62-65.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021909.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl Filed ll/l9/l9 Page 2 of 2o |\np.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, at |\nwhich time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body ,\nof an MCC inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had commited suicide |\novernight while unobserved. |\nRELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES\n2 The MCC is a federal administrative <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> |\nfacility located in Manhatan that is run by the Federal Bureau of |\nPrisons (“BOP”).

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.4\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out ofrunning for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23ol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023016.tif": "NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3.

After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out ofrunning for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nI. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.tif": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°8\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n39 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023099.tif": "She believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023110.tif": "we go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\n<span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end. I have selected tomorrou at 5:oo because it\ngives them enough time to really negotiate an agreement if they are\nserious about it, and if not, it gives me one day before the Jewish\nholiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday . . .

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023119.jpg": "federal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct.

He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ...

The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023148.tif": "On Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have... some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\n72 The Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates. See\nllo\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023149.tif": "The next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after ““6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span>\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.” At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.!”°\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/. The “Stockade” was a “louer security ‘camp-style’ facility”\nco-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office. Both were administered by the Sheriff's Office.\n\nl73 Plea in the Circuit Court, signed June 3o, 2oo8, and filed in court. Villafafia complained to Goldberger when\nshe learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”\n4 The Information is atached as Exhibit 5.\nl75 State v. Epstein, case nos. o6-CF-9454 and o8-CF-938l, Transcript of Plea Conference at 4l-42 (Fifteenth\nJudicial Circuit, June 3o, 2oo8) (Plea Hearing Transcript). Belohlavek told OPR that reciting the statutory language\nof the charge as the factual basis for the plea was the typical practice for a state court plea.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023151.tif": "Dershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.” !”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\na7 Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023155.tif": "the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram. Florida Statute § 948.ool(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the\ncommunity.”\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023156.tif": "cooperation.'®© When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span>—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'®* By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023232.tif": "information about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\nl Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely\nseparated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per\nday, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC\nNew York SHU at l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.4 During their shift, they each created and submited falsified\nofficial BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and\nsigned more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 3o-minute rounds (often\n* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. on August 9, 2ol9, folloued by an overtime shift in the\nSHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.

At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a\nmanner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”\nBecause “[i]natention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other\nincidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.” BOP policy\nprovides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies\nthat personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official\nworking hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”\nB. False Statements and Lack of Candor\nUnder federal law, “whoever, in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3).

Special Housing Units\nSHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.2l-54l.33. These\nregulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the\ngeneral inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.ll, Special\nHousing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or disciplinary\nsegregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023377.tif": "Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates, and then remain in the unit until the Control\nCenter accepts the count.

If the\nsecond count does not match the master count, then the Operations Lieutenant will order a bed-book\ncount, that is, when inmates are counted using their picture cards, which are on file in the Control Center. A\nLieutenant must take at least l count in the morning and one in the evening.\nCorrectional staff prepare count slips for each count, which must be prepared in ink, signed by both officers,\nand retained for 3o days. Count slips may not be altered. BOP policy provides that the “official count will\nnot be cleared until all count slips are received and verified in the Control Center.”\n\nb. 3o-Minute Rounds\nThe BOP uses additional accountability measures for inmates who are in administrative <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or\ndisciplinary segregation, i.e., for those detained in a SHU. In such cases, a correctional staff member must\nobserve all inmates at least twice an hour, once during the first 3o minutes (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.) and\nagain during the second 3o minutes (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.). BOP policy provides that these “rounds are\nto be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart.” These same requirements\nfor rounds are also described in the Post Orders for the MCC New York's SHU.\n\nc. Documentation Regarding Inmate Status and Confinement\nBOP policy also provides that each institution must prepare a daily change/transfer sheet, which indicates\nchanges to an inmate's status, including housing and job assignments and medical convalescence. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders require that correctional staff assigned to the SHU create a SHU file for each\ninmate housed in that unit and that morning watch officers audit the inmate files every night. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders further specify that all pertinent information about an inmate's confinement\nshould be noted on a Special Housing Unit Record Form (BP-292), and that SHU officers must maintain a log\nof pertinent information regarding inmate activity and enter such information into the BOP computer\nsystem TRUSCOPE, which provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n\nd.

BOP policy\nrecognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone\ncall outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a\nsecure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff\nmember coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the\ninmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual\ncalled, and the reason for the call.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy.

Physician Assistant 2 instructed Epstein hou he could obtain medical, dental, and mental\nhealth care.\nAt 2:58 a.m. on Sunday, July 7, 2ol9, a Facilities Assistant emailed the Psychology Department asking that\nsomeone evaluate Epstein because he appeared “distraught, sad, and a litle confused.”\nOn July 8, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist l of the Psychology Department conducted an Intake Screening of\nEpstein that included a self-report, staff observation, and a review of information in SENTRY.

Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 to Another Institution and Failure\n\nto Replace Him with Another Inmate\n\nA. Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB. MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Atorney's Request that Epstein be Housed\n\nWithout a Cellmate\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens <span class=\"highlight\">Detention</span> Facility, a contract <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023496.jpg": "Fwd: RE: United States v.

Cellmates are recommended not only for SHU inmates being removed from\nsuicide watch, but also for inmates returning to the general population seting. The C&A officer is responsible for\nentering the proper assignment.\nOnce an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and\nLieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate.\nThe e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with. This recommendation for\na cellmate and conversation with the Lieutenant is also documented in the Post Suicide Watch Report and placed in\nBEMR/PDS.\nPsychology Services has eliminated the use of Psychological Observation to avoid any confusion as to the needs of\ninmates on a watch status.\n2. Rounds: 3o-minute rounds are required by P55oo.l4, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.\nInstitution Response: 2. Rounds:\nSHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within\nthe policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a\ndaily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly. SHU Rounds sheets\nwill be maintained on the specified range to ensure officers are completing required rounds. A staff member must\nobserve all inmates confined in continuous locked doun status, such as administrative <span class=\"highlight\">detention</span> or disciplinary\nsegregation, at least once in the first 3o minute period of the hour, folloued by another round in the second 3o\nminute period of the same hour, thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be\nconducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart. All observations must be documented.\nCloser observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre\nbehavior.

An additional psychologist could also monitor Hot List inmates arriving to the SHU and\nensure they are housed with appropriate cellmates. This psychologist could conduct daily rounds to look for signs of\npsychological distress and address the concerns of our Long Term SHU inmates.
