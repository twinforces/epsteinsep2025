For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\nprotective order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4.

Judge McMahon found that the Government had established exceptional\ncircumstances to modify the protective order based on the factual record before her. Judge\nMcMahon concluded that modification was necessary under the circumstances to allou the\nGovernment to investigate a high-profile mater in secrecy and so not to tip off the target of the\ninvestigation. Although reasonable minds may differ—indeed, Judge Netburn reached the\nopposite conclusion—there was a substantial basis for Judge McMahon’s decision and it is thus\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 9o of 375\nPark Dietz, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.\nPage 28\nSara Stump and Andrew M.
