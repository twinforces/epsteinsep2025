United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts.\n36l at 3-4, 36l-7 through 36l-ll. In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or intentional violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

On July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York returned\nan indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See Dkt. No. 2.

On June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York charged\nEpstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking\nand coercion of minors. See United States v. Maxwell, l:2o-cr-33o, Dkt. No. l (S.D.N.Y. June 29,\n2o2o). In December 2o2l, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts.

Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2o24).\n\nDe On July 6, 2o25, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation\nannounced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein’s crimes and death. Since\nthen, the public’s interest in the Epstein mater has remained.

It\nclearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.\nMSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the follouing reason. On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of ail\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Maxwell, No, 2o-33o (S.D.N.Y.). We\nare concerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #6l at 2 (emphasis added).)\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personaily identifiable information,\nsuch as information about the former defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while\nwe join the Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make\nthis narrou independent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of\nwithholding personally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this\nFOIA request if necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo743\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000744.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 64 _ Filed o7/25/25 Page4of4 |\nwithheld is a question best left to the court adjudicating that future case.

The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case.

Judge Berman:\n\nI come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of hou the United States of\nAmerica’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Shou us all the files with\nonly the necessary <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”. In the end we are the biggest voices of the truth and the truth always comes\nout in time.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000760.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 69 _ Filed o8/o4/25 Page 2 of 2\nAugust 4, 2o25 Page 2\n\nDear Judge Berman, in making your decision to allou the Unites States of America’s\ncurrent siting atorneys for the DOJ’s request to release these files, I ask you to have our\natorneys review the “suggested” <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> as they are the ones who also knou the victims, their\nnames, their truths and their stories unlike the Unites States Government who did not and does\nnot even care to knou our truth.

(Epstein Dkt. 67; Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nIn particular, on July l8, 2o25, the Government moved the Court to unseal grand jury\ntranscripts from these cases, subject to appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.

The Court directed the Government to provide supplemental briefing (Epstein Dkt. 63;\nMaxwell Dkt. 789), which the Government submited on July 29, 2o25 (Epstein Dkt. 66; Maxwell\nDkt. 796). In addition, the Court set a schedule whereby the defendants and victims could set out\ntheir positions on or before August 5, 2o25.

In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand\njury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts.\n\n2. Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3. Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the\ngrand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that\nis not already part of the public record, taking into account\nthe sources above.\n\n(Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nBecause the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects,\nthe Government respectfully submits this consolidated leter response.\n\nFirst, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in\nthese cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d l8l, l86 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (“trial exhibits are judicial\ndocuments to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d at lo49)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit\nthe Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000763.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of 4\nHon.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000765.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7l Filed o8/o5/25 Pageiofl\nH h Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP\nug es One Batery Park Plaza\nNew York, New York looo4-l482\nHubbard Office: +l (2l2) 837-6ooo\n& R d Fax: +l (2l2) 422-4726\nee hugheshubbard.com\nDaniel H.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential\nleniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000769.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of5\nBSF\naffirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to protect their personal privacy.\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the <span class=\"highlight\">Redactions</span>.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Redactions</span> of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F. Supp. 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000770.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 ~ Filed o8/o5/25 Page5of5\nBSF\n2o24). Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. <span class=\"highlight\">Redactions</span> of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. /d. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> were in fact adequate.

Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000773.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\nTailoring.\n\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary.

United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C.

Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>).\nMany Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, § 377l (a)(8)\nand the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 35o9(d)\nprinciples.\n\nWI.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.

After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all briefing.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.

(McGuirk, Kelly) (Entered: l2/lo/2o2o)\n\nl2/l4/2o2o 95 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, in\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt.

After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all briefing.

The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool732\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page l of 4\npe N U.S. Department of Justice\nNSF United States Atorney\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal. The Government does not object to the public filing\nof the affidavit atached to the Defense Leter in unredacted form. Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s designation of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order § l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s companion submission, that designation is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.! That alone strongly weighs in favor of permiting the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\nand sealed filings at issue: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(6) provides, in relevant part,\n‘To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001739.jpg": "Honorable Alison J.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the Court’s order, dated November 25, 2o2o, directing Ms. Maxwell to justify why her leter\nof the same date requesting an in camera conference to discuss confidentiality concerns related\nto her Renewed Motion for Release on Bail (the “Motion”) should be sealed or redacted.\n\nWe continue to believe that sealing the November 25, 2o2o leter (the “November 25\"\nLeter”) in its entirety is warranted and appropriate under the governing case law. Houever, in\nresponse to the Court’s order, we ask the Court to file a redacted version of the November 25\nLeter, atached hereto as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information necessary to protect\nthird parties from threats and harassment. In addition, because this leter must make reference to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail application and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly identified by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

We are acutely mindful that courts are\ngenerally reluctant to seal anything in a court filing beyond what is required by statute or local\ncourt rules. We are therefore proposing targeted <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, consistent with the case law in this\nCircuit, that are no more extensive than necessary to protect these third parties. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256\nF. Supp. 3d 355, 4ll (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (Nathan, J.) (granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits\non privacy grounds). Ultimately, we seek the same privacy protections for these people that the\ngovernment has sought and obtained for Ms. Maxwell’s accusers and for other information\ncovered by the Protective Order in this case.\n\nBy making this request for redaction, we are not trying to litigate this case in secret. We\nare merely seeking the ability to file a renewed bail application for Ms. Maxwell without further\nrisking the safety and privacy of sureties needed to support that application. This is the first of\nseveral confidentiality issues that will arise in connection with the Motion, and the sureties will\nbe looking at the Court’s ruling as an indication of the level of confidentiality they can expect to\nbe afforded. These individuals have requested that their privacy and safety be appropriately\nprotected by the Court.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court file the proposed\nredacted version of the November 25\" Leter, atached as Exhibit A, and the proposed redacted\nversion of this leter, atached as Exhibit B.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release\non bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court\nDENIES the Defendant’s motion.\nIn light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that\nshould not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose\nany <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> by reference to\nthe Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir.\n2oo6). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted,\nthe Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.\nThis Order provides the botom line of the Court’s resolution. On July l4, 2o2o, this\nCourt conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial detention was warranted\nbecause the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance at future proceedings. Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if\nthe Court finds “that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo223o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo4 Filed l2/28/2o Page 2 of 2\nnone of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a\nmaterial bearing on the Court’s determination that she poses a flight risk.\n\nFurthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention\nwas warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release\ncan reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings. In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial detention continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its omnibus memorandum of law opposing\nDefendants’ twelve pre-trial motions. It filed the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits,\nunder temporary seal pending the Court’s resolution of its request to redact sensitive or\nconfidential information. See Dkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to\ncertain of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Having considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the\nGovernment’s requests for <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and sealing, as well as the Defendant’s additional\nredaction requests, with the exceptions discussed belou.\n\nTo begin with, the Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under\nthis test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial\ndocuments;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials;\nand (i) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o.\n“Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd. at\nl2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (““Amodeo I?’)).\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002763.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 2 of 5\n\nThe proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> mostly satisfy this test. First, the Government’s brief in\nopposition to the Defendant’s pre-trial motions is a “judicial document” for purposes of the first\nelement of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir.\nl995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First Amendment\npresumption of access. /d. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrouly tailored to\nserve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access.\n\nLike the Government’s previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the\nGovernment bases its requests on its contention that <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and/or sealing are necessary to\nprotect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties’ personal\nprivacy interests. As a general mater, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for\novercoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d\n46o, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> in the\nGovernment’s brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit l contains a single redaction—the\nname of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual’s personal privacy interests\noutweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only\nthe names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety\nand privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that ataches to those\ndocuments.\n\nThe Court overrules the Defendant’s objections to the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> contained in Exhibit 5\nof the Government’s brief and adopts the Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.

Notwithstanding this, the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to which\nthe Defendant objects relate to the privacy interests of third parties, which the Second Circuit has\nadmonished “should weigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo IP’), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995). At least some of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to which the\nDefendant objects relate to private “family affairs” of a third party, a factor that “weigh[s] more\nheavily against access than conduct affecting a substantial portion of the public.” Jd. at lo5l.\nAnd though the Defendant contends that some of the information contained in the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> is\npublic, she furnishes no evidence to that effect. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nsignificant privacy interests at stake justify the limited and narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\ncontained in Exhibit 5.\n\nIn addition, the Court adopts the Defendant’s proposed additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to pages\nl29-l34 of the Government’s brief. Those portions of the transcript, which were redacted in the\ncivil mater, concern privacy interests and their disclosure would merely serve to cater to a\n“craving for that which is sensational and impure.” Amodeo II, 7l F.3d at lo5l (citation\nomited). The Court thus concludes that such <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\ncontained in pages l-l28 of the Government’s brief. To provide some context, the redacted\nportions of the brief relate to sealed proceedings that took place before different judges relating\nto the issuance of grand jury subpoenas in connection with the present case. See Dkt. No. 5l.\nBecause the Government’s brief is a judicial document and because the presumption of access\nataches, the Government’s redaction requests must be “necessary to preserve higher values and\nonly if the sealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2764\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002765.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 4of5\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Courts have noted that “disclosing the details of\nthe Government’s efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation, as the\nindividuals and entities under investigation would be put on notice.” United States v. Madoff,\n626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9). And the Government’s interest in protecting an\nongoing investigation from the “danger of impairing law enforcement” may be a countervailing\nfactor that outweighs the presumption of access. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. But the\nGovernment advances no non-conclusory basis as to why its investigation at this stage of the\nmater would be imperiled by the disclosure of the information regarding hou it obtained the\ninformation in question, and the requested <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are far from narrouly tailored. As a result,\nthe Court denies the Government’s redaction requests in pages l-l28 and denies its request to\nfile Exhibits 8 and 9 under seal, since those documents relate to this very issue and the same\nreasoning applies to them. The Court will give the Government an opportunity to seek more\ntailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> if it wishes and to specifically justify the ongoing need to redact the requested\ninformation and documents. By March 22, 2o2l, the Government may file a leter with the\nCourt—under seal, if necessary—justifying the specific redaction and sealing requests.\nAlternatively, by that date the Government can indicate that it will not seek to renew the request.\n\nFurthermore, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\ncontained in pages l87-l88 of the Government’s brief. While the Court previously had granted\nthe request to redact the same information, see Dkt. No. 99, the Court no longer sees a basis for\nkeeping this information under seal in light of the strong presumption of access. The information\ndoes not in itself contain any personally identifying information, and the Court concludes that\nany minimal threat of interference with the Government’s investigation through the disclosure of\nthis information is outweighed by the presumption of access that ataches to those portions.

Honest answers to those questions—for instance that Epstein in fact\nhad a scheme to recruit underaged girls for sexual massages—would have been corroborative of\nsome of Giuffre’s claims. Second, had the defendant honestly answered the deposition questions,\nGiuffre could have located other victims or witnesses who may have corroborated her testimony.\nBut in any event, the question of materiality should be put to the jury and is inappropriate for the\nCourt to resolve on a motion to dismiss without the benefit of the full factual record. The motion\nshould be denied.\nallegations that were central to the dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 4, Ex. I at 7:3-6.)\n(The last colloquy has been unsealed except for Minor Victim-2’s name. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP),\nDkt. No. l2l2-l).) Yet Judge Preska’s opinion as to the propriety of certain <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> in a civil\ncase is not controlling as to whether the Government can meet the elements of a criminal perjury\ncharge here. First, before Judge Preska were the defendant’s denials of various sexual activities,\nnot honest answers that would have been quite different. In part for that reason, Judge Sweet\nauthorized the deposition at the outset. Second, the Government was not a party to the civil\nunsealing litigation and did not have an opportunity to be heard on this issue before Judge Preska.\n>! While the Government is open to crafting a stipulation on the background of the Giuffre lawsuit\nto streamline presentation of these issues to the jury, it notes that the defendant’s summary of that\nsuit as set forth in her motion is incorrect. (£.g., Def. Mot. 4 at 2o (erroneously asserting that the\ndefamation claims at issue turned on Giuffre’s ability to prove salacious allegations about public\nofficials)).\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 239\nthese interviews constitute witness statements covered by the Jencks Act and are not subject to\ndisclosure by statute until after each witness has completed direct examination at trial.

These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein.

This testimony is, in any case, far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to\nthe dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell. Although the prurient interest of some may\nbe left unsatiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in keeping private the\ndetails of her sexual relationships with consenting adults warrants the sealing\nof those portions of her testimony (and any materials that reference them).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3847\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l7 Filed o4/l9/2l Page3of6\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril l, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nThe testimony at issue is undeniably private: it relates exclusively to Ms. Maxwell’s\nconsensual adult sexual activities involving “‘sex toys or devices used in sexual activities” and\na “three-way sexual” encounter involving an adult “blond and brunete.” See Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558, 567 (U.S. 2oo3) (“It suffices for us to acknouledge that adults may\nchoose to enter upon [a] relationship in the confines of their homes and their oun private lives\nand still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate\nconduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is\nmore enduring.”); see also Griswold v. Connecticut, 38l U.S. 479, 485-86 (U.S. l965). And\nMs. Maxwell proposes only those <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> “narrouly tailored” to preserve her privacy\ninterest in her intimate, consensual adult sexual activities. Press-Enterprise IT, lo6 S.Ct. at\n2743. Rather than seek to redact either the argument or the surrounding testimony, Ms.\nMaxwell marked for redaction those limited portions of the deposition transcript that Judge\nPreska ordered sealed. The remaining unredacted portions generally describe the redacted\ntestimony such that the public and media will have no issue ascertaining the nature of the\nlegal issues nor fulfill their role in monitoring the Courts. Inclusion of the exact lines\nreferencing “three-way sexual activity” or “sex toys” does not add to the argument but\nredacting those lines does preserve Ms. Maxwell’s privacy in testimony that was both\ncompelled and obtained under highly improper methods.\n\nIn addition to her privacy interests, Ms. Maxwell seeks to preserve her right to a fair\ntrial free from unfair pretrial publicity concerning what may ultimately be deemed\n“inadmissible” evidence at the criminal trial. United States v.

Indeed, this Court rejected Ms. Maxwell’s argument that certain portions of\nthe Response and its exhibits should be unredacted because the material had already been\nmade public. See Dkt.

Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (holding that\nthe privacy interests of third parties “should weigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation”).

In balancing competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the\nspecific arguments the Government has put forward in this leter, including the need\nto protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly\ntailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.

The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF.

These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

The underlying motion papers reference the names\nof accusers and potential witnesses who have spoken on the public record in this case and others\nwho have spoken publicly but not associated themselves directly with this case. The Court has\nruled that the existence of the Protective Order, by itself, is not sufficient to justify <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, and\nthat any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified under the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe defense has consistently taken the position that the names of the accusers and other\nwitnesses who have chosen to speak to the media about their alleged experiences, including\nregarding the very materials sought by the subpoena, should be publicly disclosed and that it is not\nthe defense’s burden to justify redacting their names. Accordingly, the defense does not seek any\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. If the government wishes to seek any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, we respectfully submit that it is their\nburden — not Ms. Maxwell’s — to justify them under Lugosch.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5oo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 323 Filed o8/l9/2l Page2of2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

From the\nface of the expert notice, it appears that few if any of the defendant’s eight experts would offer\ntestimony whose relevance only became apparent after the Government’s production of Jencks\nAct material and its exhibit list, and it is unlikely that these eight experts were all retained in the\nlast two weeks.

See Transcript at 7l-72. The Government’s supplemental leter does not address\nthis issue. While acknouledging that the Court’s request may have been unclear, the\nGovernment is nou ORDERED to file a supplemental leter responsive to the Court’s question\non or before l2:oo p.m. on November 7, 2o2l. For the sake of clarity, the Government is\ndirected to state its position as to whether this anticipated witness could be deemed a victim of\nany of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for purposes of\nrestitution under l8 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006180.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8 Filed ll/o8/2l Pagelofl\nU.S. Department of Justice\nNSF United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Rather than focus narrouly on reliable opinions that would be relevant to\nissues in this case, the defendant proposes to have Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus testify broadly about\na wide variety of topics, from testimony about various psychological disorders to testimony\nregarding the generation of false memories in laboratory setings, that are not helpful to the jury.\nMany of those opinions are also unreliable, squarely within the ken of the average juror, or would\ninvade the province of the Court and the jury if offered.\n\nTo the extent Dr. Rocchio is permited to testify on her opinions, the Court should admit\nreliable opinions on the same topics by defense experts. But the defense’s expert notice for Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus is far more expansive, and some of the defense’s responsive opinions are not\nreliable. The Court should preclude many of their opinions.\n\nl. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE CERTAIN OPINIONS FROM DR. DIETZ\nA. Background\n\nAs described in the defense expert notice, atached as Exhibit A!, the defense offers the\nopinions of Dr. Dietz, an expert psychiatrist, both in response to the Government’s expert Dr. Lisa\nRocchio and on several other subjects.\n\n' The Government moves to file a redacted version of Exhibit A and to seal Exhibit B. The\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although these exhibits are\njudicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been\npublicly identified, and who are a subject of the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain\nvictims and witnesses testify under pseudonyms, and third parties. Because the Government has\nalready moved to file a redacted version of Exhibit A (see Dkt. No. 4l8), the same version is\natached to this motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 432 Filed ll/lo/2l Pagellof5\n(gto. .\nU.S. Department of Justice\neee United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-oo33o (AJN) — Unsealing of\nDefendant’s Motion for a New Trial and Questionnaires of Seated\nJurors\nDear Judge Nathan:\nI write on behalf of The New York Times Company (“The Times”) to\nrequest that the Court unseal (a) Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial and\naccompanying brief and exhibits (Dkt. 58o) and (b) the filled-out\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. These records are subject to\nboth First Amendment and common law rights of access, which set\nstringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with\nonly those <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> necessary to protect the identities of jurors, to the\nextent they have not already been disclosed. We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> necessary to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct. On January 5, 2o22, the parties wrote to this Court\nregarding public statements made by one juror, identified as “Juror 5o,”\nabout hou his jury room disclosure that he was a victim of sexual assault\n' The right of access is an affirmative enforceable public right, and it is well-\nestablished that the press has standing to enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 6o9 n.25 (l982);\nHartford Courant Co. v.

See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard.

For\nthe reasons set forth belou, the defense believes that Ms. Andriano’s last name should not be\nredacted in the publicly filed version of Court Exhibit 2.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to Court Exhibit 2 were the subject of some discussion among the parties.\nThe government originally proposed that Court Exhibit 2 should be filed under seal because the\nlist of names is alphabetized and redacting only anonymized names would provide identifying\ninformation for anonymized witnesses. The defense objected to that proposal on the grounds that\nit was unnecessary and overbroad to seal the entire document and that the names of anonymized\nwitnesses could be redacted.\n\nThe defense further objected to Ms. Andriano’s name being redacted in any way due to her\nrecent post-trial interview with the Daily Mail, in which she publicly disclosed her full name and\ndeclared her intention to waive her right to anonymity.

The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\npre-trial, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors.

This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n?

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is in receipt of the parties’ leters addressing the Defendant’s request to\ntemporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits, and the Government’s\nresponse in opposition and accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 59o, 594, 595. Several media\norganizations have also filed leters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s\nmotion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The\nDefendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 5o’s motion.\n\nFor the reasons outlined more fully belou, the Court rules as follous. First, the\nDefendant’s motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a\nnew trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrouly tailored to serve\ncompeting interests. In this case, important interests include preserving the integrity of any\ninquiry process going forward as well as protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Protection of\nthese interests, houever, can plainly be accomplished through tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Follouing the\nCourt’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if one is ordered, all <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> will be\npromptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page4of7\n\nAccordingly, the Defendant’s motion to keep the papers under seal in their entirety is\ndenied. Instead, the parties must propose narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> as necessary to serve\nimportant interests. Here those interests are to ensure the integrity of any inquiry going forward\nand to protect juror anonymity and privacy. Those interests justify redaction of the questions the\nparties propose be asked at any hearing. See United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7) (requiring proposed questions to be\nsubmited directly to the court); see also Dkt. No. 329 at 38-39 (counsel discussing concern that\ndisclosing specific questions ahead of hearing would allou juror to prepare and “rehearse the\nanswers”). And they may justify redaction of any specific factual information developed by the\nparties that has not been publicly reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired\nabout at any forthcoming hearing. The Court will also permit <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> necessary to ensure\njuror anonymity and privacy. See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464\nU.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). By contrast, there is no basis to redact legal arguments, case citations,\nand analysis regarding the standard by which the parties contend that the Defendant’s motion\nshould be evaluated, as well as legal arguments, case citations, and analysis regarding the proper\nscope of any potential hearing. Nor will the Court permit the redaction of information that is\nwidely reported in the press. Such <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> do not conform with the dictates of Lugosch and\nare not necessary to protect the integrity of any inquiry.\n\nImportantly, follouing the Court’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if\none is ordered, all <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> will be promptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any\ncontinuing interest in juror anonymity and privacy.\n\nThe parties are thus ORDERED to propose narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Defense\nmotion, the Government’s response in opposition, and the Defense reply, as consistent with this\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 - Filed o2/ll/22 Page5of7\nOrder, via email on or before February l6, 2o22. Because this Order resolves the scope of\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all filings related to the motion, the Court adjourns sine die the briefing schedule\npreviously set for the parties to justify any proposed sealing or <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the new trial motion\npapers. See Dkt. No. 585. The Court will rule on the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> so the filings can be\ndocketed, and the Court will file under seal unredacted copies of any documents for which\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are approved.\n\nAt the time the briefs are docketed with approved <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, the Defendant is further\nORDERED to docket Exhibits 2 and 3 to her motion and the exhibit to her reply, and the\nGovernment ORDERED to docket all exhibits to its opposition, all of which are publicly\navailable documents.!\n\nI. Juror 5o Motion to Intervene\n\nThe Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, which both the Government\nand the Defense oppose. Defense Motion, at 5l-52; Government Response, at 44; see also\nDefense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22. The Court denies the motion. Juror 5o cites no authority to support\na juror’s intervention when he will possibly be subject to a post-verdict inquiry. The cases he\ncites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to intervene to assert First Amendment access\nby the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of privileged information.\nAlthough cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into\nallegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 5o does have, no cases support intervention. See,\ne.g., McCoy, No. l4 Cr. 6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329 at 6-7 (appointing counsel for juror alleged\nl Exhibit l to the Defendant’s motion, which is Juror 5o’s completed questionnaire, is to be maintained temporarily\nunder seal pending the Court’s ruling on whether a hearing will be held and on the New York Times Company’s\nmotion to unseal the filled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. Dkt. Nos. 583, 585. The Court will\naddress Juror 5o’s request that a copy of his questionnaire be released to his counsel at that time.

The Defendant also fails to articulate\nhou docketing Juror 5o’s oun motion could affect the testimony of any potential witness and\nultimately affect the integrity of any inquiry into Juror 5o’s conduct. The possibility of media\natention does not outweigh the presumption of access.

Under the circumstances presented here, where jury selection and the trial\nhave been completed, releasing juror questionnaires is consistent with the strong presumption of\naccess to the jury selection process, including juror questionnaires.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nBy leter dated February l6, 2o22, the defendant proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the parties’\nbriefing regarding Juror 5o. (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Government respectfully submits this leter in\nresponse to the defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, which are overbroad and inconsistent with both\nthe public’s right of access to judicial documents and the Court’s February ll, 2o2l Order, which\npermited <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of three narrou categories: (l) the questions the parties propose be asked at\nany hearing, (2) specific factual information developed by the parties which is not public, and (3)\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to protect juror anonymity and privacy. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4).\n\nThe categories of <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> proposed by the defendant are impermissibly broad. In\nparticular:\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussion of the substance of Juror 5o’s questionnaire. For\nthe reasons set forth in the Government’s February 4, 2o2l and February ll, 2o2l leters\n\n(Dkt. Nos. 594, 598), the Government respectfully submits that Juror 5o’s questionnaire\n\nshould be made public, along with all other questionnaires of the twelve seated jurors in\n\nthis case. Indeed, the defendant has not opposed the New York Times Company’s motion\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o3 _ Filed o2/l6/22 Page 2of3\n\nPage 2\nfor public access to those questionnaires. Accordingly, it is not necessary to redact\ndiscussions of Juror 5o’s questionnaire from the briefing.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about the statistical composition of the jury\npool. In particular, the defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about hou the Court\naddressed during jury selection the multiple prospective jurors who disclosed experiencing\nsexual abuse, assault, or harassment. These <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are not contemplated by the Court’s\nOrder. While quotations or discussions of specific sealed juror materials may be redacted,\nthere is no basis to redact legal arguments about the jury pool as a whole.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[d]etails of investigative steps the defense has taken and\nevidence uncovered thus far.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). As an initial mater, the Government notes\nthe defense briefing contains very minimal non-public information. To the extent any of\nthe defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> address non-public materials, the Court has authorized\nsuch <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[t]he defense’s view of the underlying facts.” (Dkt. No.\n6o2). But the Court expressly ordered that the parties should not redact legal arguments or\ndiscussions of publicly available facts, which is exactly what the defendant nou proposes\nto do. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4). The Court has already ruled that these proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are\nnot narrouly tailored.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussions of her “requested discovery in advance of the\nhearing.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Court did not authorize this category of <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\nMoreover, the defendant does not offer any justification for her request, and the\nGovernment sees none.\n\nIn addition, the Government notes that the defendant has proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to portions\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008972.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o5 Filed o2/l8/22 Pagellof3\nUSDCSDNY\nDOCUMENT |\nELECTRONICALLY FILED |\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #:\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK iddeealasensned ean\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Follouing\nEpstein’s sudden and untimely death almost three years ago, Judge Berman provided an\nopportunity for any victim to make a statement regardless of whether they qualified under the\nCVRA. Kate, Virginia Giuffre, and Sarah Ransome each spoke at that hearing, Annie Farmer\nspoke solely on behalf of her sister, Maria Farmer. See United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (Dkt.\n53). But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing\nconducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on\nthe rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is\nnot the case here. While it is appropriate for the public to be present and for legitimate CVRA\n> Noticeably missing from Ms. Ransome’s statement is conduct that very well may have contributed to\nher allegations: She was high-priced “escort’ for Emperor’s Club, the agency patronized by Elliot Spitzer.\nLitigation cited in her impact statement revealed that in or about October 2oo6, Ms. Ransome work for an\nagency, got paid thousands of dollars per “escort” and engaged in sexual activity. A modeling photo of\nMs. Ransome produced in her discovery appeared on the Emperor’s Club advertisement. The government\nprosecuted the Emperor’s Club ouners. See United States v.

Such an open forum would have significant and adverse\nconsequences to any criminal defendant facing the most critical stage of the case: sentencing and\ndeprivation of liberty.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding should not a bully pulpit for anyone\nwho was not identified as a victim of the charged federal offenses and does not qualify as such\nunder the CVRA.

Accordingly, their\nwriten submissions are deemed part of the record and to the extent Annie Farmer, Kate, and/or\nGiuffre seek permission to make an oral statement at sentencing, that request is granted.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 682 Filed o6/24/22 Page3of4\n\nThe Defendant also seeks partial or full <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of some of the statements, citing\nreferences to issues that were not disclosed by the Government or revealed during the victims’\ntrial testimony (with respect to Annie Farmer and Kate); concerns about credibility (with respect\nto Giuffre); and due process concerns (with respect to the remaining individuals) Def.’s Ltr. 5—7.\nThis request for <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> is denied.\n\nThe Court has litle difficulty concluding that the statements at issue are judicial\ndocuments to which the common law and First Amendment presumptions of public access\natach.

These records are subject to\nboth First Amendment and common law rights of access, which set\nstringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with\nonly those <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> necessary to protect the identities of jurors, to the\nextent they have not already been disclosed. We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> necessary to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct. On January 5, 2o22, the parties wrote to this Court\nregarding public statements made by one juror, identified as “Juror 5o,”\nabout hou his jury room disclosure that he was a victim of sexual assault\n' The right of access is an affirmative enforceable public right, and it is well-\nestablished that the press has standing to enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 6o9 n.25 (l982);\nHartford Courant Co. v.

When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard.

Amodeo (Amodeo II), 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l995)).\nAlthough the government claims that the items must remain sealed due to an “ongoing\ninvestigation,” they have failed to explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the\nsame materials they obtained via their ex parte and in camera procedure are being released to\nthe public under the Giuffre unsealing process, without objection from the government. The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to\ndemonstrate that denial of public access is “essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly\ntailored to serve that interest.” United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting\nPress-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4).\nMs. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case\nto determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge\nMcMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have nou become\n“Judicial documents” by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers,\nhouever, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those\nmaterials.\nObjections to <span class=\"highlight\">Redactions</span> Proposed on Pages l87-l88\nMs. Maxwell also objects to the government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> on pages l87-l88. The\nlanguage at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed\nsupports her allegations. Importantly, Accuser-2 read from this allegedly corroborating diary\nona NY Times podcast. Yet nou the government seeks to redact her explanation for why Ms.\nMaxwell is not mentioned once in this diary: Accuser-2 “stopped writing in her journal about\na month after that first meeting with Epstein” and the rest of her diary is “personal in nature\nand ha[s] nothing to do with the defendant or Epstein.”\nHou that document, or its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could nou\nbe “confidential” is unexplained by the government in its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has\nnot acted as though the contents are “confidential.”\nObjections to Government’s Proposed <span class=\"highlight\">Redactions</span> to Exhibit 5\nFor similar reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> proposed by the\ngovernment to Exhibit 5 to their Response. The materials highlighted in our atached Exhibit\n5 are all very public pieces of information, at the instigation of Virginia Roberts. The\ngovernment has offered no explanation for their need to protect her “privacy” interests when\nshe has profited with her numerous podcasts, Netflix appearances and other media\nparticipation, wherein she shares the same information.

The Government did not argue that\nthose witnesses merited pseudonyms on their oun, but rather that they needed derivative\nanonymity to protect the Minor Victims.\n\nNumerous other witnesses testified at trial for the Government under their true name,\nincluding those closely associated with the defendant and Epstein, such as Larry Visoski, Juan\nAlessi, David Rodgers, and Nicole Hesse. And the Government did not seek anonymity for a\nnumber of other witnesses the Government ultimately did not call at trial.\n\nThe defendant nou seeks anonymity protection for three lay witnesses, none of whom are\noffered to testify as victims of sexual abuse: a. Michelle Healy, and i.\n\nIll. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion should be denied for two reasons. First, it seeks anonymity for\ncategories of witnesses that courts generally have not previously permited to testify with their\nidentities protected. Second, the defendant’s request does not implicate her right to a fair trial or\nto present a defense.\n\nFirst, none of the defense witnesses satisfy any of the established categories of witnesses\nwho courts have permited to testify under pseudonyms. The defendant does not even suggest that\nPo fits into any such category. (Def. Leter at 8-9). Indeed, the defense concedes\n' The Government also offered a large number of exhibits under seal or in redacted form. Those\nrequests largely, if not entirely, concerned (l) witnesses whom the Court permited to testify using\npseudonyms or under their first names; (2) personal identifying information, such as addresses; (3)\ninformation related to third parties, that is, individuals who are not testifying at trial or at issue in\nthe case; or (4) exhibits where information for testifying witnesses was co-mingled with private\ninformation so extensively that <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> were impractical.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 726 Filed o7/l3/22 Pagellof3\ncom\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED |\n\nUnited States of America,\n\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\n\nALISON J.

Those are both state court\n\nl4 documents. There are some <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> on them in their current\nl5 form, but because the unredacted versions are public, anyone in\nl6 possession of these redacted versions would be able to compare\nl7 them against court records that have the full information which\nl8 would be identifying as to Jane. For that reason, our view is\nl9 that these documents should be under seal in their current\n2o form. If the defense wants to unredact more from the sealed\n2l versions, the jury has a complete unredacted version, we\n22 certainly would have no objection to that. But because these\n23 are court documents that can be compared up against public\n24 records that would easily identify Jane if a redacted version\n25 were released to the public, and for that reason, these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool2772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 26l ll62\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl exhibits should be under seal.\n\n2 THE COURT: I thought I did admit that under seal, but\n3 maybe I misremembered.\n\n4 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we ended up admiting the\n5) one complete document. It is nou marked J8 and 9 because it's\n6 the one that contains the seal. I think to narrouly tailor\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> so that it can't be matched up, it may include the\n\n8 case number, for example, certainly the plaintiffs' names, but\n9 otherwise I think there is a way to redact this so that the\n\nlo public has access to the bulk of the exhibit, but just not the\nll personally identifying information.\n\nl2 Again, I'm happy to speak with Ms. Moe about what she\nl3 believes are the things that would lead to be a personally\n\nl4 identifying piece of information, but portions of it, including\nl5 the defendants' names and other pieces were testified about\n\nl6 publicly on the record, not under seal.\n\nl7 So, I think to keep the entire exhibit under seal does\nl8 not comport with Lugash and the other precedent that requires\nl9 us to sort of take a pen to the parts that are concerning.\n2o THE COURT: So let's do this, same process. If I\n2l didn't already, J8 and J9 are temporarily sealed and you'll\n22 confer on <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\n23 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We'd be happy to confer.\n24 I do want to flag, because these documents are entirely public\n25 in full, it is very easy for a member of the public to compare\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool2773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of 26l ll63\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl them against other public records, which are unredacted and\n\n2 have Jane's identifiers. So the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> we would propose\n\n3 would be substantial and perhaps beyond recognition in order to\n4 avoid that problem.\n\n5 For example, in a civil case in this district, if you\n6 were print out from ECF the full docket entry and it were a\n\n7 public document that had identifiers for the person who filed\n\n8 that civil suit, in order to redact it to make sure someone\n\n9 couldn't troll around PACER and find the public version, you\n\nlo would have to redact essentially everything, and that's the\n\nll problem here. The same is true for the copy --\n\nl2 THE COURT: Please just take a look, see if there is\nl3 an agreement that you'll propose to me, taking into account\n\nl4 also what is already public regarding the document in the trial\nl5 transcript.\n\nl6 So, one of the lessons, too, is that simply you can't\nl7 just look in isolation. So if information is already public,\nl8 then redacting it -- but you'll look and see if there is some\nl9 appropriate middle ground that would ensure the continued\n2o privacy of the witness consistent with the law.\n2l MS.

Maxwell, Case No. 2o-Cr-33o\nDear Judge Engelmayer:\n\nOn behalf of MSW Media, Inc. (“MSW Media”), I respectfully submit this leter motion\nto intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially\nopposing the Government’s motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case,\nfiled as Docket No. 785.\n\nMSW Media (htps://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and blogs about\nfederal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It\nclearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.\n\nMSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the follouing reason. On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of all/\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Epstein, No. l9-49o (S.D.N.Y.). We are\nconcerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #785 at 2 (emphasis added).)\n\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personally identifiable information,\nsuch as information about Defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while we join\nthe Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make this narrou\nindependent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of withholding\npersonally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this FOTA request\nif necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly withheld is a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015061.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 795 Filed o7/25/25 Page4of4\nquestion best left to the court adjudicating that future case. We are concerned that, if this Court\nexplicitly or implicitly blesses the Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of non-victim-related\npersonally identifiable information (even in passing), that opinion will be treated as a proverbial\nthumb on the scale in our FOIA case without materially affecting the Court’s decision in this\ncase,\n\nIn other words, if this Court mentions in its decision that it was swayed at all by the\nGovernment’s promise to redact personally identifiable information, we are concerned that the\nGovernment will then argue in its FOIA case that “Judge Englemayer agreed that this\ninformation should not be publicly disclosed.” Therefore, we respectfully request that this Court\nnot take the Government’s statements regarding non-victim-related personally identifiable\ninformation into account when reaching its decision regarding the Government’s motion, and we\nfurther request that the Court specify that it is not opining on that question, should it grant the\nGovernment’s motion.\n\nThe Government takes no position on the intervention of MSW Media. I atempted\ntwice—Wednesday and Thursday—to reach Defendant’s counsel and have not received a\nresponse, so I am filing this as an opposed motion due to the fast-moving nature of this case.\n\nSincerely,\nVie\nCounsel for Proposed Intervenor\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015067.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page6oflo\nSupp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (applying Jn re Craig) (“Many historians ... have spent\ncountless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story.

Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page9oflo\n\nB. Additional Information\n\nThe Court directed the Government to state whether, “before filing the instant motion,\ncounsel for the Government reviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the\nGovernment provided notice to the victims of the motion to unseal.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3;\nMaxwell Dkt. 789 at 3).\n\nBefore filing the motions to unseal, relevant counsel for the Government reviewed the\nEpstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts. In addition, the Government has nou provided notice\nto all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at issue in this\nmotion. The Government has atempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have\nbeen unsuccessful. In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other\nindividuals identified in the transcripts.\n\nC.

(Epstein Dkt. 67; Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nIn particular, on July l8, 2o25, the Government moved the Court to unseal grand jury\ntranscripts from these cases, subject to appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785). The Court directed the Government to provide supplemental briefing (Epstein Dkt. 63;\nMaxwell Dkt. 789), which the Government submited on July 29, 2o25 (Epstein Dkt. 66; Maxwell\nDkt. 796). In addition, the Court set a schedule whereby the defendants and victims could set out\ntheir positions on or before August 5, 2o25. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3-4; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 4).\n\nOn July 3l, 2o25, the Court directed the Government to provide additional information by\nAugust 4, 2o25, in particular, in the Epstein case, a leter:\n\nl.

Analyzing hou the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52)\nfiled in this case impacts proposed disclosure, with legal\nauthorities.\n\n(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand\njury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts.\n\n2. Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3. Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the\ngrand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that\nis not already part of the public record, taking into account\nthe sources above.\n\n(Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nBecause the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects,\nthe Government respectfully submits this consolidated leter response.\n\nFirst, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in\nthese cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d l8l, l86 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (“trial exhibits are judicial\ndocuments to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d at lo49)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit\nthe Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8oo Filed o8/o5/25 Page3of4\nHon.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015083.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8ol _ Filed o8/o5/25 Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n2o Cr, 33o (PAE)\n“Y-\nQRDER\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL,\nDefendant.\nPAUL A.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. Jd. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3—7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential\nleniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Pagellof27\nBSF\n, affirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to protect their personal privacy.\n\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the <span class=\"highlight\">Redactions</span>.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Redactions</span> of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F. Supp. 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l2 of 27\nBSF\n2o24). Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. <span class=\"highlight\">Redactions</span> of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. Jd. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\nae oe\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

Engelmayer\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\n) Page 3\n\nsome, the Maxwell conviction is the only meaningful measure of criminal accountability;\n\nits erosion would be devastating.’\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23.

Indictments\n\nIn late November 2ol8, prompted by investigative journalism, the United States Atorney\nin this District opened an investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators. On July 2, 2ol9, a\ngrand jury returned an indictment that charged Epstein with participating in a sex trafficking\nconspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) and (b).? On July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested.\n' A motion seeking, on similar terms, the unsealing of grand jury materials in Epstein’s case is\npending before the Hon. Richard M. Berman. See United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n(S.D.N.Y. July l8, 2o25), Dkt. 6l.\n\n* See United States vy. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (S.D.N.Y.

Motion to Unseal the Maxwell Grand Jury Materials\n\nOn July l8, 2o25, the Deputy Atorney General (“DAG”) filed a three-and-a-half-page\nmotion to unseal the grand jury transcripts in this case. Dkt. 785 (“Motion to Unseal’”’).’ The\nmotion stated:\n\nOn July 6, 2o25, the [DOJ] and [FBI] issued a memorandum describing an\n\nexhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein\n\n(the “Memorandum”). The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the [DOJ]\n\nand [FBI] to determine whether evidence existed that could predicate an\n\ninvestigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, no such\n\nevidence was uncovered during the review.\n\nSince July 6, 2o25, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the\n\nMemorandum’s conclusions. While the [DOJ] and [FBI] continue to adhere to the\n\nconclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American public is\n\nof the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the\n\ninvestigative work conducted by the [DOJ] and [FBI] into Epstein, the [DOJ]\n\nmoves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in [United States v.\n\nMaxwell and] United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of victim-\n\nrelated and other personal identifying information.\n\nId.

Dkt. 8o8.l\"!\nIt also submited a sealed leter that identified the portions of those exhibits that were not already\nmaters of public record.\n\nWil. Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'! The Court hereinafter refers to the grand jury transcripts and exhibits together as the “grand\njury materials.”\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l4 of 3l\n\n(v) hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place;\n\n(vi) the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that of\n\ntheir families;\n\n(vil) the extent to which the desired material—either permissibly or\n\nimpermissibly—has been previously made public;\n\n(vill) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might be affected by\n\ndisclosure are still alive; and\n\n(ix) the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.\n\nTd.\n\nThe doctrine is to be applied only in “exceptional circumstances,” and it does not justify\ngranting “garden variety” petitions for disclosure unauthorized by Rule 6(e). /d. at lo3 (citation\nomited). The burden is on the requestor to demonstrate that disclosure is appropriate, and “the\nbaseline presumption [is] against disclosure.” Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll, 43 F.4th at 285\n(alteration in original). “[T]he discretion of a trial court in deciding whether to make public the\nordinarily secret proceedings of a grand jury investigation is one of the broadest and most\nsensitive exercises of careful judgment that a trial judge can make.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d\nat lo4; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll, 43 F Ath at 285-86.\n\nIV. Discussion\n\nA. The Government’s Basis for Claiming “Special Circumstances”\n\nNo Rule 6(e)(3) exception authorizes the disclosure the Government proposes here: of,\nsubject to <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, all testimony and exhibits before the two grand juries that indicted\nGhislaine Maxwell. The Government’s motion to unseal does not contend otherwise. It does not\nargue that these materials would aid federal, state, military, tribal, or foreign law enforcement; or\nwould be relevant to national security officials, another grand jury, or another judicial\nproceeding. Nor does the Government (or Maxwell) argue that the materials could reveal a\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2o of 3l\nby State Department official Alger Hiss); see also note l2, supra (citing similar D.D.C. cases).\nNone of these cases involved the secondhand, summary-witness testimony of law enforcement\nagents. None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\nAmendment. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2l of 3l\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. /d. at 492-93. And once Biaggi’s testimony had been released, the Circuit\nelaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi\nhad misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand\njury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer l7 questions. /d. at 494. In these “special\ncircumstances,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi’s false account. /d.\n\nThis Court gave careful consideration to unsealing the Maxwell grand jury materials on a\nsimilar rationale. But with the Government having nou conceded that the information it\nproposes to release is redundant of the public record—that this information was “made publicly\navailable at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly reported”—the public interest in\ntesting the Government’s bona fides does not require the extraordinary step of unsealing grand\njury records. Dkt. 8oo at 3. Without any need to review the grand jury materials, the public can\nevaluate for itself the Government’s asserted bases for making this motion.\n\nThe Court therefore denies the Government’s motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary\nto the Government’s depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a mater of significant\nhistorical or public interest. Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two\nlaw enforcement agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a mater of\nlongstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the\n2o2l Maxwell trial.\n\nB. Application of the In re Craig Factors\n\nIn cases involving grand jury testimony of significant historical or public interest, /n re\nCraig supplies a framework for evaluating whether disclosure, on balance, is warranted.

And the Government’s stated rationale for its motion\nbears no resemblance to any “grounds that justify disclosure under the existing exceptions listed\nin Rule 6(e).” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nIn arguing that this factor favors disclosure, the Government makes broad proclamations\nabout the public’s interest in learning more about the Epstein-Maxwell investigation. See Gov’t\nMem. at 5 (“Many questions remain unanswered, and the public’s interest remains.” (quoting Jn\nre AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 294)). That interest is undeniable. But the Government has failed to\nconnect it to the materials at issue, which would not answer any of the public’s questions.\n\nThis factor decisively weighs against unsealing.\n\n4, What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\n“The specificity of the data sought is significant in at least two ways.” In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6.\n\nFirst, there are obvious differences between releasing one witness’[s] testimony,\n\nthe full transcript, or merely the minutes of the proceeding. And, second, it is highly\n\nrelevant whether the disclosure is general or limited to a specified number of people\n\nunder special circumstances.\n\nId. at lo6—lo7 (citation omited).\n\nHere, the Government does not seek tailored disclosure of discrete items within a grand\njury record. Nor does it seek leave to disseminate grand jury materials to a specified audience.\nIt seeks disclosure to the public at large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury,\nsubject only to <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nThis factor weighs against unsealing. The Government has identified no information of\nconsequence within the grand jury record that is not already public. And, under Jn re Craig, the\nblanket quality of the motion to unseal weighs against unsealing.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 28 of 3l\n9. Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third\nparties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their\nnames and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\nlo. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, leters on behalf of\nnumerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 8o4, 8o6. Their leters address whether\nthe Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about\nrecent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe leters, in the main, urge broad disclosure of the Government’s investigative records\nregarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the\nMaxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted\nto protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 8o4 at 6 (“We are in full agreement with the\npublic disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related\ninformation and documents in the possession and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[, ]\nand other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The\nvictims’ interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the\nunderstandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information. See, e.g.,\nid. at lo (“Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would allou additional important information to\nemerge... .”’); id. at 9 (“[T]he instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and\nabhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes.”). The Government had, after all, publicly\nportrayed these as “critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history.” Motion to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015190.jpg": "mca, STATE OF FLORIDA « PALM BEACH COUNTY\n(Sy eo | hereby certify that the foregoing is a\nhd me z ‘y%\\ true copy of the record in my office with\nFt MOM }S=| <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, if any as required by law.\nay Se AS vw sy,\nwy kA THis 22\" Day of AWVOMIEL, 29 Zh\nSecu JOSEPH ABRUZZO\nCLERK GF JHE os Y COURT & COMPTROLLER\nDeputy C ferk 4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 95 of 267 2l23\nLCACmax3 A.

EVERDELL: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.\n4 MS. MOE: Your Honor, one last issue with respect to\n5 three exhibits. We had a chance to review the transcript from\n6 last week from the cross examination of Jane, we noticed that\n7 there were three defense exhibits that were offered which were\n8 not offered under seal but which contained identifying\n\n9 information for Jane, so we wanted to address that. We\n\nlo conferred with defense about that.\n\nll Taking those exhibits in order, the first is\n\nl2 Defendant's Exhibit Jl5. So this exhibit contains some\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, but there is additional identifying information as\nl4 to Jane. I flagged that for defense counsel. What we would\nl5 propose is that we work together to mark a further redacted\n\nl6 version which would become Jl5R, and that Jl5 itself would\n\nl7 remain as it is and under seal as it is offered during her\n\nl8 testimony. So we'll work with the defense to propose\n\nl9 additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>, mark that, and make sure that that's in\n2o the record, but I just wanted to flag that because, as it\n2l stands, the underlying exhibit is not yet received under seal\n22 and because that contains identifying information, we'd ask\n23 that that exhibit be sealed at this juncture.\n24 MS. MENNINGER: I don't believe that Jl5 does have\n25 other additional identifying information, but I'm happy to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2l of 26l ll6l\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl speak with Ms. Moe and we can try to come to an agreement about\n2 any further <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. It was a civil case that was filed\n\n3 under a pseudonym, and I don't knou if we'll be able to reach\n\n4 agreement, but we'll certainly try as far as a further -- I\n\n5 don't have an objection to having a conversation about\n\n6 potential further redaction.\n\n7 THE COURT: Okay. So Jl5 is sealed pending\n\n8 conversation that you'll discuss about <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and just\n\n9 would like to buton that up by the end of the day.\n\nlo MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. We'll do that.\n\nll THE COURT: Thank you, counsel.\n\nl2 MS. MOE: There are two additional exhibits, those are\nl3 Defendant's Exhibit J8 and J9. Those are both state court\n\nl4 documents. There are some <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> on them in their current\nl5 form, but because the unredacted versions are public, anyone in\nl6 possession of these redacted versions would be able to compare\nl7 them against court records that have the full information which\nl8 would be identifying as to Jane. For that reason, our view is\nl9 that these documents should be under seal in their current\n2o form. If the defense wants to unredact more from the sealed\n2l versions, the jury has a complete unredacted version, we\n22 certainly would have no objection to that. But because these\n23 are court documents that can be compared up against public\n24 records that would easily identify Jane if a redacted version\n25 were released to the public, and for that reason, these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 26l ll62\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl exhibits should be under seal.\n\n2 THE COURT: I thought I did admit that under seal, but\n3 maybe I misremembered.\n\n4 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we ended up admiting the\n5) one complete document. It is nou marked J8 and 9 because it's\n6 the one that contains the seal. I think to narrouly tailor\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> so that it can't be matched up, it may include the\n\n8 case number, for example, certainly the plaintiffs' names, but\n9 otherwise I think there is a way to redact this so that the\n\nlo public has access to the bulk of the exhibit, but just not the\nll personally identifying information.\n\nl2 Again, I'm happy to speak with Ms. Moe about what she\nl3 believes are the things that would lead to be a personally\n\nl4 identifying piece of information, but portions of it, including\nl5 the defendants' names and other pieces were testified about\n\nl6 publicly on the record, not under seal.\n\nl7 So, I think to keep the entire exhibit under seal does\nl8 not comport with Lugash and the other precedent that requires\nl9 us to sort of take a pen to the parts that are concerning.\n2o THE COURT: So let's do this, same process. If I\n2l didn't already, J8 and J9 are temporarily sealed and you'll\n22 confer on <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\n23 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We'd be happy to confer.\n24 I do want to flag, because these documents are entirely public\n25 in full, it is very easy for a member of the public to compare\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of 26l ll63\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl them against other public records, which are unredacted and\n\n2 have Jane's identifiers. So the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> we would propose\n\n3 would be substantial and perhaps beyond recognition in order to\n4 avoid that problem.\n\n5 For example, in a civil case in this district, if you\n6 were print out from ECF the full docket entry and it were a\n\n7 public document that had identifiers for the person who filed\n\n8 that civil suit, in order to redact it to make sure someone\n\n9 couldn't troll around PACER and find the public version, you\n\nlo would have to redact essentially everything, and that's the\n\nll problem here. The same is true for the copy --\n\nl2 THE COURT: Please just take a look, see if there is\nl3 an agreement that you'll propose to me, taking into account\n\nl4 also what is already public regarding the document in the trial\nl5 transcript.\n\nl6 So, one of the lessons, too, is that simply you can't\nl7 just look in isolation. So if information is already public,\nl8 then redacting it -- but you'll look and see if there is some\nl9 appropriate middle ground that would ensure the continued\n2o privacy of the witness consistent with the law.\n2l MS.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations applicable to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have l5 pages to object to the\nfive motions proposed belou, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to\nkeep it shorter than that, but also allou for more space to provide specifics to the Court.\n\nSecond, we have obtained new contact information for Doe l from a separate civil\nsuit. We believe that Doe l retains a right to notification and participation.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit\ntheir proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> no later than September 4, 2o2o; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>,\nthey shall submit a joint leter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.\nl Atachment A to Opening\nBrief\nDOJ-OGR-oool944o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019459.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 6l, o9/24/2o2o, 293828o, Page2 of l25\nTable of Contents\n\nDocket Sheet ...........::csceesceesceesseeseeeesneeseeesaeeeseeeseeesaeesaeeesaeesaeesaeeeeeeseeeseeeees ool-ol2\nol7 Superseding Indictment (7.lo.2o)...........:ssesesseeeeeeeeeeeeteseeseeeeeeeeeeeseees ol3-o3o\no27 Defts Ltr.

The requested <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019556.jpg": "Cased ZB are S3osANTen tide Wher 42o2 FF iRRB 68o /PAgetyeisl ab4\nHonorable Alison J.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release\non bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court\nDENIES the Defendant’s motion.\nIn light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that\nshould not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose\nany <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> by reference to\nthe Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir.\n2oo6). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted,\nthe Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.\nThis Order provides the botom line of the Court’s resolution. On July l4, 2o2o, this\nCourt conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial detention was warranted\nbecause the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance at future proceedings. Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if\nthe Court finds “that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool97l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019714.jpg": "Case L2G d4lo633o-ccImeDozuie h? LOL l Filed TR8282o9ePagfe2 of 2\nnone of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a\nmaterial bearing on the Court’s determination that she poses a flight risk.\n\nFurthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention\nwas warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release\ncan reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings. In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity.

On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.

On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all briefing.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all briefing.

It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all briefing.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter. Requesting\nmedical atention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk. We request that the\nCourt order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information.

The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access.

The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and\nOrder concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's\nmotion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and the justification for any such proposal.

The Court held a\nlengthy bail hearing on July l4, 2o2o. After extensive briefing and argument at the\nhearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no\nconditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance.

On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page25 of 9l\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-—CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all briefing.

Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes\nthat these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law\npresumptions of access atach. In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the specific arguments the\nGovernment has put forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy\ninterests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\nSee United States v.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. l33, l39) (Signed by Judge Alison\nJ.

Nos. 372, 373, 375. The Court will\nprovide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror numbers on\nNovember l6 at the commencement of voir dire. The placeholder for the juror\ninformation sheet in the Courts draft questionnaire refers to the information sheet\nrequired by the Jury Department. See Dkt. No. 365. The information sheet will be\nremoved and collected by the Jury Department from the packet before the parties\nreview of the questionnaires. The Court is still considering the logistics of when\nperemptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will\nbe exercised on November 29. Assuming so, the swearing in of the jury, preliminary\ninstructions, and opening statements would commence immediately follouing the\nsimultaneous (via submission of lists) exercise of peremptory challenges.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance.

If either party\nproposes <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22.

The narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

As noted in its prior Order, follouing the Court's\nresolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> will be promptly\nunsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page82 of 9l\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will conduct the\nquestioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant and the\nGovernment. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance with\nthe Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22.

It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020512.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page26 of 92\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-—CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all briefing.

The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government\nobtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her\nrights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self—incrimination, and to\ndue process of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine whether the Government knouingly misrepresented facts to procure an\norder modifying the protective order. The Court requires information from the\nGovernment for scheduling purposes. The Government is ORDERED to inform the\nCourt by leter docketed on ECF no later than April 2o, 2o2l, whether it intends to use\nany of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the\nnon—perjury counts in this case.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. l33, l39) (Signed by Judge Alison\nJ. Nathan on 6/25/2l)(Gw) (Entered: o7/ol/2o2l)\n\no6/3o/2o2l | 3o5 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2o2l (Dkt.\nNo. 3o3), any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Court's opinion on Maxwell's motions to\nsuppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 3o, 2o2l.

The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the\nDefense indicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted. The\nGovernment is accordingly ORDERED to docket a leter on ECF on or before January\n28, 2o22, indicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this\nwitness. Once the Government confirms in that leter that it no longer seeks redaction\nof the name, then the Defense may file the temporarily sealed leter on the docket\nwithout redaction of the name.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v.

The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22.

Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020569.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page83 of 92\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that\nJuror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.\nThe Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire and a copy of\nthis Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will conduct the\nquestioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant and the\nGovernment. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance with\nthe Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom\n9o6 of the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York,\nNew York at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed the\nbrief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the Court's\nresolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See Dkt. No. l62.\nOn March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> that the\nGovernment had proposed, and she proposed additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>. Having considered\nthe parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction requests, with the\nexceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file\nExhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other\nportions are part of the public record.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> for all briefing. SO ORDERED. (Signed by\nJudge Alison J.

The Court's conclusion is\nguided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.\nof Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of defense lawyers’ clients in other\nmaters and to allou defense counsel to comply with their professional obligations under\nthe rules of professional conduct.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office as\nthe trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent\nwith the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury.\nHouever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur\nduring the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the\nGovernment's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the\nCourt can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial\ncommencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in\nadvance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall\nmeet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The\nparties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone\nregarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4,\n2o2l. The Court will accept only a joint leter with a joint proposal or with each sides\nviews briefly stated. The leter must atest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed\nleters will be struck.

Nathan on\n3/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5 minutes at night.\nDkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

No. 272, describes generalized grievances but makes\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 43/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020666.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page48 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nno additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges\nthe MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be reduced. The\nCourt also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell\nis subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her\nsafety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with the\ntreatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of her\nrights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nand to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government\ndid not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a\nprotective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES\nMaxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

If any <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are proposed, the Court\nwill determine whether any are appropriate and then docket the motion. The parties shall\nrespond to Juror 5os motion on or before January 2o, 2o22. Upon further reflection,\nunless and until Juror No. 5o is permited to intervene, he may have no standing to be\nheard on the question of whether an inquiry should be conducted. Accordingly, the Court\nwithdraws the aspect of its prior order seting January 26, 2o22, as the date by which\ncounsel for Juror 5o should file a submission on the issue of the appropriateness of an\ninquiry.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No.\n58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\nredaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\nreference to the three-part test in Lugosch v.

If either party\nproposes <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> or sealing must be filed on the public docket.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO INTERVENE AND FOR\nRELEASE OF SEALED JURY QUESTIONNAIRE AND TRANSCRIPT, ON BEHALF\nOF PROPOSED INTERVENOR, JUROR 5o as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 6o8 MOTION.\n(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order,\na hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 596, and justifying any such request by\nreference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid.\nCo. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

See Dkt. No. 698. With one\nexception, the Court concludes that the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> are narrouly tailored to\nprotect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 and the privacy interests of witnesses,\nincluding individuals subject to the Court's pseudonym order, and individuals who were\nanticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately called. See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span>.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 7l2 from the docket. The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l Administrator Feldman's\nMotion to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\nDefendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any\ndocuments not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.\nAny proposed <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafaia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaia, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7°° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “‘[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional <span class=\"highlight\">redactions</span> of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

I'm not\nll sure if there is a continuing objection, Mr. Everdell. The\n\nl2 previous objection was to the assertion that the defendant is\nLs responsible for the victimization of untold number of other\n\nl4 victims. The probation department adopted the government's\n\nl5 suggestion, revised the paragraph to assert that the defendant\nl6 is responsible for the victimization of additional minor\n\nl7 victims. To the extent there is a continuing objection, I\n\nl8 overrule it for the reasons stated regarding paragraphs 27 and\nl9 28.\n2o Paragraph 85 is an objection to the inclusion of\n2l Kate's victim impact statement and her status under the CVRA.\n22 We have litigated the question of Kate's ability to make a\n23 statement here.
