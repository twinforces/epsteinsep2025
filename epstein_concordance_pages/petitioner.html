Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators.

Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Whether we were required or not.” Sloman also\ntold OPR that while “we didn’t think that we had an obligation to send them victim notification\nleters... I think... Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off” sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°\n329 CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Jane Doe #2 also recetved a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.°®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**! Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\n\n368 Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span>, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed. The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*”°\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\n<span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\nS28 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\n394 Inre Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB.

July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me.

At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4526\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 242 of 349\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 249 of 349\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, ““The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n329 CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 262 of 349\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.*®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**4 Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\ntbe Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4559\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 263 of 349\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°7 In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span>, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 272 of 349\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed. The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*??\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\n<span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\nS28 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\n394 Inre Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo.

The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency.

Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). This legislative history\nmakes no mention of crimes, such as Mann Act violations, that do not categorically\ninvolve the actual abuse of minors.\n\nRather than grounding its construction of § 3283 in the text or legislative\nhistory of the statute, the District Court relied almost exclusively on an inapposite\ndecision from this Court, Weingarten v. U.S., 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2ol7). The\nDistrict Court conceded, as it had to, that Weingarten is not controlling (Al47), but\nit essentially and erroneously treated Weingarten as though it were. The only\nquestion in Weingarten was whether the <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span>’s trial counsel provided\nconstitutionally deficient representation by conceding that an indictment charging\nMann Act violations was timely. See 865 F.3d at 52. The <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> contended\nthat his trial counsel should have argued that § 3283 must be interpreted under a\ncategorical standard. See id. at 58. This Court disagreed only because “/i/t was\nnot obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it today, that a\ncourt must apply a categorical approach, rather than a fact-specific analysis, to\ndetermine whether an offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.” Id. at 58-59\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021163.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 7o, o4/26/2o23, 35o55l2, Pagel of 8\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse 4o Foley Square, New York, NY looo7 Telephone: 2l2-857-85oo\nMOTION INFORMATION STATEMENT\n\nDocketNumber(s): 22-l426 oo Caption fuse short tile]\nof time to file the appellee's brief and appellant's reply brief\nSet forth belou precise, complete statement of relief sought:\n(l) permission to file a brief of no more than 2o,ooo words; . oo .\nOT I United States v.

In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7**\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafaia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafaia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate... all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “‘as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021415.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34l 3536o38, Page243 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?\"” Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\nAu8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021422.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 348 3536o38, Page25o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open... it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n32o CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021437.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA D6l 3536o39, Page7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.>\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\nJudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.*°* Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.°® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence.

July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”3°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span>, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”\"°° Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n366 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n362 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n2o8 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n389 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021447.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagel7 of 2l7\nSA-27l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\n\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\n\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\n\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\n\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed. The government\n\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\n\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.°”\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\n<span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°°* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished /n re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\n228 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\nal Inve Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">petitioner</span> Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021470.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 359o4 3536o39, Page4o of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.
