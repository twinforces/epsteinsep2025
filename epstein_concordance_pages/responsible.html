Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll).

The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000977.jpg": "Case F-26-BOBSHAURDSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA B2o Pagerr? of 26o\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter. Requesting\nmedical atention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk. We request that the\nCourt order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such\ninformation falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in\nCriminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of sensitive items of\ndiscovery that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s\nright to privacy.\n\nThe incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her\nisolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and\ninvestigated within the facility. The guard <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks.

On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video. We request that the Court direct the government to provide defense counsel with\nthat video. In response to any misconduct of guards, the standard reply is that “the mater will be\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool4oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 8 of 26\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ll) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (ll) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42q)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 2o of 26\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

Supp. lo48, lo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989).\n\nFinally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-l9 pandemic would\npose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to flee the United States, particularly to\n” The media spotlight has also drawn out people who claim to speak for Ms. Maxwell, and even purport to have had\ndirect communications with her, but who, in fact, have no ties to Ms. Maxwell whatsoever.

Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA.

Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA.

The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002632.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of l4\nabuse of minors.

The Government conducted multiple additional interviews of both victims, as well as\nother witnesses, and took additional investigative steps over the next several months before it was\nprepared to seek an indictment charging the defendant. Those two victims were critical to the\ninvestigation, as they helped form the basis of the charges in the Indictment, which the Government\nsought on June 29, 2o2o, less than a year after the victims came forward.

As noted above, two\nkey witnesses who helped give rise to the instant charges did not agree to speak law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9, facts that significantly undercut the notion that the Government was intentionally\nsiting on a criminal case against the defendant for any meaningful period of time.

Applicable Law\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ... .” The Due Process Clause\n“protects individuals against two types of government action.” Martinez v. McAleenan, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 349, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Procedural due process “ensures that government cannot\nunfairly and without meaningful process deprive a person of life, liberty, or property,” while\nsubstantive due process “prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the\nconscience, or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Jd. (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited; alteration omited).\n\nProcedural due process analysis focuses on whether “government action depriving a person\nof life, liberty, or property. . . [is] implemented in a fair manner,” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 746 (l987). “Courts examine procedural due process questions in two steps: the first\nasks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the\n[Government]; the second examines whether the procedures atendant upon that deprivation were\nconstitutionally sufficient.” United States v.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out ofrunning for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims.

In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded. The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:7°°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nWI. THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.”**’ On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?°8\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n\n267 OLC is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l9 of 348\n\nOLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olce/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report. The\nDepartment promulgated the guidelines in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA,\nwhich instructed the Atorney General to develop and implement such guidelines. Victim and Witness Protection Act,\nPub. L. No. 97-29l, § 6, 96 Stat. l248 (l982). The 2oo5 Guidelines were superseded in October 2oll, as explained\nbelou.\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.?”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.””” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 254 of 348\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed”’ On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”?*\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo343o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 274 of 348\nB.

The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. <span class=\"highlight\">Responsible</span> officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*° The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

For example, in Atorney Griev. Comm’n of Md. v. Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84 (Md. 2ol5), the\nCourt of Appeals of Maryland concluded that a prosecutor’s failure to provide any notice to the minor victim’s foster\nfamily about the resolution of a sex abuse case during the ten months the prosecutor was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the mater\nwas a “consistent failure” amounting to “gross negligence in the discharge of the prosecutorial function” that deprived\nthe victim of his rights under the Maryland Constitution. The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional\n\n257\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 288 of 348\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not <span class=\"highlight\">Responsible</span> for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm |isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”*? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.*“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 2\nCe: \"StanPotinger@aol.com\" <StanPotinger@aol.com>, \"brad@pathtojustice.com\"\n<brad@pathtojustice.com>\nSubject: Virginia Guiffre\nAmanda,\nThank you again for meeting with us today.

The first step in the process of analyzing the qualified jury wheel is to re-create the\nmaster jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random selection from the\nvoter registration lists. The master jury wheel was chosen from the November l, 2ol6 county\nvoter registration lists. Based on geocoding the master jury wheel, I was able to estimate that a\nproper random sample from the complete November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists would have\nbeen ll.88% African American and l3.79% Hispanic. Hence, if a simple random sample had\nbeen selected, the absolute difference between the African American percent in the master jury\nwheel and the community would have been only o.57 percentage points, and the absolute\ndifference between the Hispanic percent in the master jury wheel and the community would have\nbeen only o.33 percentage points. Hence, the voter lists are a good representation of the\ncommunity benchmarks for representation of African Americans and Hispanics\n\n7. As pointed out by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin, the selection of the individuals on the\nmaster jury wheel was not a simple random sample from the November l, 2ol6 voter registration\nlists. That is, all registered voters did not have an equal chance of selection. There were two\nreasons for this. One, registered voters from the counties which provided jurors to both the\nManhatan and White Plains master jury wheels were less likely to be selected than registered\nvoters in counties which fed only the White Plains master jury wheel. Two, except for Dutchess\nCounty, inactive registered voters were not selected for the master jury wheel.' These reasons\nwere <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the actual master jury wheel being only ll.2o% African American and\n' The voter registration lists for all counties but Dutchess did not include inactive registered\nvoters.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3624\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel4of23\nalternative explanation for this difference in terminology, reasonable or otherwise—presumably\nbecause it cannot.\n\nThus, a drafting prosecutor who intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision\nto the SDFL clearly knew hou to do so, using either of two methods employed elsewhere in the\ndocument. The government could have used the same language in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision that it used in the Epstein immunity provision, providing that “the United States . . .\nwill not institute any criminal charges in this District against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” It did not. Alternatively, it could have referred expressly to the USAO-SDEL, as it did\nelsewhere in the NPA, and provided that “the United States Atorney’s Office . .. will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Again, it did\nnot. It would be absurd to conclude that a reasonable prosecutor who had used both drafting\ntools to limit other provisions of the NPA, yet failed to use either of them in the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision, intended to impose the same limitations on the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision—let alone that Epstein would reasonably have understood this intent.\n\nThe government’s inability to provide a reasonable alternative explanation for its use of\ndifferent language in the different provisions of the NPA removes any potential ambiguity from\nthe co-conspirator immunity provision.

The Court should summarily deny the MDC’s request and require it to respond to the\nspecifics in the Court’s order.\n\nThe claim that “[d]Juring Ms. Maxwell’s legal visit, staff noted she was in receipt of\ndocuments that were handed to her by the atorneys” does not justify the confiscation and review\nof Ms. Maxwell’s confidential legal documents. Any documents which “Ms. Maxwell was in\nreceipt” were documents that Ms. Maxwell brought to the visiting room. Counsel did not hand to\nMs. Maxwell any documents that did not originate from Ms. Maxwell. Further, it was after Ms.\nMaxwell called counsel to report that her documents were seized and counsel, in turn, informed\nMs. Maxwell that a complaint would be made that MDC staff contacted legal counsel.\n\nOnce again, the Court is provided second-hand information from the MDC. Ms.\nPapapetru was not present during the legal visit, does not claim to have reviewed the video\nrecording of the legal visit, and failed to provide any helpful or reliable information (either by\nway of an affidavit or declaration or a copy of the recording) to rebut the claims before the\nCourt. A recycled reporting of the guards’ inaccurate observation is an inadequate response to a\nsignificant problem. The MDC has failed to offer any legitimate, fact-based explanation for\nviolation of Ms. Maxwell’s 6 Amendment rights. The Court should disregard the MDC’s\nresponse and order the relief requested on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.\n\nConsidering the MDC’s atempt to cast the conduct of its staff in a positive light while\ncasting aspersions on Ms. Maxwell and counsel, we request that the Court direct that the guards\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the inappropriate seizure be summoned to Court and a copy of the video\nrecording be provided to defense counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 254 _ Filed o4/29/2l Pagelof2\nN)*| Sea SS ]*IN U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nNS Agi Federal Bureau of Prisons\nSS ra Metropolitan Detention Center\nSSS\n8o 29% Street usDcSDXNY ~~ —*&~d\nBrooklyn, New York ll232 DOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #: =\nApril 28, 2o2l DATE FILED: 4/29/2l |\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 349\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004322.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 349\nB.

In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C.

In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6o of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l9 of 349\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the nghts included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such nghts\nwere afforded. The passage of the CVRA repealed the nights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:*©°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nIl. THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”*®\n266 H.

No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\nor OLC is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004517.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22o of 349\n\nOLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report. The\nDepartment promulgated the guidelines in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA,\nwhich instructed the Atorney General to develop and implement such guidelines. Victim and Witness Protection Act,\nPub. L. No. 97-29l, § 6, 96 Stat. l248 (l982). The 2oo5 Guidelines were superseded in October 2oll, as explained\nbelou.\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22l of 349\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 222 of 349\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUSA/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 255 of 349\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.’\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 275 of 349\nB.

The purpose of the 2oo5 Guidelines was “to establish\nguidelines to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice investigative,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 Guidelines are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. <span class=\"highlight\">Responsible</span> officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges.

In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional\n\n257\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 289 of 349\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not <span class=\"highlight\">Responsible</span> for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o4 of 349\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm lisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004961.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l Page /7of7\nPage 7\n\nbecause it is doing so in pleadings, it is not crossing the line in the local rules. For\nexample, the Government filed in a public pleading that Ms. Maxwell was vaccinated\nwhile at MDC. (Dkt. No. l96).

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005894.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005930.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 45\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\n\nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 4o and 5o for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nDenial of Consent\nA key issue in sexual assault is whether consent was given for the sexual\ncontact. Consent is complex and, in real-world situations, may have signifi-\ncant variability and may be rather subtle and, in general, an intricate process.\nRarely do sexual interactions begin with individuals explicitly stating “I give\nyou permission to do x, y, and z” (Hall, l998). Consent in sexual situa-\ntions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t\nsay no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or\n“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and\nMuehlenhard (l999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than\nverbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knouledge of what is\nbeing consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent\nor not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s\n“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret\ndifferently. Houever, mistakes can be made in these situations and given\nthe motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be motivated (“I want this,\nso I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;\nI was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).\n\nUnderstanding whether consent was given is made more complex by\nthe fact that consent early in the interaction for a certain kind of sexual\ncontact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.\nIn addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all\nfuture contact. This complexity led to the infamous Antioch College consent\npolicy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and\nevery time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly\nask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,\nl996):\n\nIf the level of sexual intimacy increases during an interaction (.e., if two\n\npeople move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to\n\nundressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people\ninvolved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that\n\nnew level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of\n\nsexual intimacy in an interaction, that person is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for geting the\n\nverbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.\n\n(p. l37)\n\nThis policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it\nraises the question hou explicit and hou often does consent need to be\nconveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which\nthe alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be interpreted\nas providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize\nthis. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe\nconsent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006302.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of:\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “...

Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 45\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\n\nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 4o and 5o for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsible</span> Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page 9ofl6\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nAll Claim Forms must be completed to the best of a Claimant’s ability and filed no later than the Filing\nDeadline.

Both the Claimant\nand the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed\nrelevant to the Administrator’s evaluation and determination of the claim before the Administrator’s\nfinal disposition of the claim.\nIf a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant,\nexplain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant’s Legal\nRepresentative (where applicable) to assist in submiting a complete claim.\n\nB. Claims Evaluation and Determination\nClaims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each\nsubmited individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all\nrequired documentation has been submited to the Administrator, with due consideration granted to\nClaimant’s good faith explanations for delays and/or absence of documentation.\nl. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims\n\nAs to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the\ninformation available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will\nconsider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to:\n\ne The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the\nnature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the\nage of the victim at the time of the abuse.

Parse objects to being held\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>, for Guidelines loss calculations purposes, for the full amount of loss generated by the\ncorrupt endeavor and scheme to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.

Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial demonstrated that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”). These objective\nfacts indicate that the jury remained impartial.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to demonstrate actual bias is fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No. 643\nat 2l (citing Smith v. Phillips, 45 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982), for the proposition that the remedy is\nlimited to a hearing for “actual bias” and noting that the Second Circuit has not decided whether\nimplied or inferred bias may be considered in this context)). But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias. (See id. at 27-28).

If there is one thing we\nlearned from Juror 5o at the Hearing, it is this: he should never have been a member of this jury.\nJuror 5o conceded that he gave false responses to not one, but three critical questions on the juror\nquestionnaire, all of which, had he answered them truthfully, would have revealed his prior\nsexual abuse. The abuse Juror 5o described at the Hearing, which he should have disclosed on\nthe questionnaire and during voir dire, was remarkably similar to the abuse described by the\ngovernment’s four key victim witnesses and would, by itself, have formed the basis for a\nchallenge for cause.

In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited relationship with another man and Sarah Kellen had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with\nTed Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374, 2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Sarah Kellen, whom he\nrecalled seeing for the first time touards the end of his employment in 2oo2, “immediately took\nover” responsibility for answering the phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the\nPalm Beach residence as soon as she was hired. (Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v.

Ms. Maxwell Did Not Supervise Another Criminal Participant.\n\nUnder the plain language of USSG § 3Bl.l and its commentary, Ms. Maxwell does not\nqualify for an aggravating role enhancement. The Guidelines are clear that for any of the three\naggravating role enhancements to apply, the Court must first find that Ms. Maxwell supervised at\nleast one other criminal participant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2 (“To qualify for an\nadjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or\nsupervisor of one or more other participants.” (emphasis added)); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d\nl46, l56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2). A “participant” is defined as “‘a person\nwho is criminally <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the commission of the offense, but need not have been\nconvicted.” USSG § 3Bl.l cmt. n.l; Skys, 637 F.3d at l56.\n\nThere is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offenses against “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn, which form the basis for the\nthree offense groups in the PSR. See PSR 4] 89-9o.” According to the trial testimony, the only\ncriminal participants in the offenses involving “Jane” and Annie Farmer were Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. There is certainly no support in the record that Ms. Maxwell supervised Epstein. In\nfact, the record is clear that the opposite is true: Epstein directed and managed Ms. Maxwell,\n\n7 Because the Court ruled that “Kate” is not a victim of the offenses of conviction, Probation and the government\nagree that the conduct related to “Kate” cannot be treated as a separate offense group and is not subject to a\nGuidelines analysis. See PSR at 58-59. We therefore do not address the application of any enhancements or\nadjustments based on evidence related to “Kate.” Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell\nsupervised another criminal participant in her offense conduct.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 29\nwho was his employee. According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen scheduled massage\nappointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\nKellen. Rather, Kellen was hired by Epstein as his assistant to replace Ms. Maxwell and take\nover responsibility for scheduling massage appointments and other property management tasks at\na time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the\nday-to-day affairs of his residences.\n\nFor example, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was hired sometime between 2ooo-\n2oo2 to be Epstein’s assistant and that she, and not Sarah Kellen, was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant\nfrom when she was hired in l996 up through the end of her employment in 2oo2.

Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 26 of55\n“one involving five or more knouing participants” (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomited)). Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the application of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise extensive.” The defense correctly points out that Application Note 2 to this\nGuidelines provides, “To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management\nresponsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Application Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been convicted.” Despite those Application Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise extensive” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise extensive” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” enhancement applies. See United\nStates v. Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d 796, 8o3-o4 (2d Cir. l997), abrogated in part on other grounds,\nUnited States v.

Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 45of55\nfor exactly what it is: a desperate atempt to shift the blame for her oun crimes and distract from\nthe gravity of her offense conduct.\n\nIn short, the defendant has lied repeatedly about her crimes, exhibited an uter failure to\naccept responsibility, and demonstrated repeated disrespect for the law and the Court. The\ndefendant’s history and characteristics weigh in favor of a Guidelines sentence.\n\n3. The Need to Promote Respect for the Law and to Afford Adequate Deterrence\n\nThe importance of promoting respect for the law and affording adequate deterrence further\nsupports imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range. Given the magnitude, breadth, and\nsophistication of the conduct in this case, those interests are best served by a significant term of\nimprisonment. The defendant’s patern of exploitative conduct, and her lies to evade responsibility\nfor her crimes, should be met with punishment that holds her accountable for the full measure of\nher criminal conduct and the abuse and horror for which she is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>.\n\nA Guidelines sentence would also deter those who would facilitate sexual abusers in\npositions of pouer. As the Government has emphasized throughout this case, Jeffrey Epstein\ncould not have commited these crimes without the defendant. The defendant, an adult woman,\nwas able to provide a cover of respectability to Epstein that lulled the victims and their families\ninto a false sense of security. This case sends the important message that those who would conspire\nwith sexual predators will be held <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for their significant role in these crimes.\nAccordingly, a Guidelines sentence is necessary to afford deterrence.\n\nThe lenient sentence the defendant seeks would send the message that there is one system\nof laws for the rich and pouerful, and another set for everyone else. It would also send the message\nto victims that, even if they have the courage to report their abusers and undergo the excruciating\nexperience of testifying in court, there will be no meaningful accountability.

This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram.

What is the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Epstein VCP” or\n“Program’) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to\ncompensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H\nFeldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate\nof Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also\nserves as the Administrator of the Program (“Administrator”). The goal of\nthis Program is to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for\nsuch sexual abuse.\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nfor all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual\nclaims submited to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy\nto determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation\nfor each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject\nany individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or\notherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof\nrequirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the\naccompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol\n(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program voluntary?\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and\nparticipation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights\nyou may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and\nexecute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and\nwithdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has\nno role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.\nThe Administrator has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to\ndetermine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l7 of l7\nThe Claimant is solely <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> to satisfy any and all other valid liens\n(other than Medicare and Medicaid liens referenced above) that have been\nasserted and/or may be asserted for reimbursement of any medical benefits\nprovided to the Claimant by a third party as a result of the injuries claimed.\n4. Are counseling services available for victims-survivors?\nAlthough counseling services are not provided through the Program,\nsuch services are available to victims-survivors through FBI Victims\nServices and other similar entities.\nThe FBI’s Victim Services Division (VSD) is commited to providing\nservices and support to victims of crimes commited by Jeffrey Epstein.\nYou can find an overview of VSD’s mission and resources at\nwww.fbi.gov/resources/victim-services. If you would like to speak with\na Victim Specialist, or if you have any questions regarding your rights\nto victim services and referrals, please email victimservices@fbi.gov.\n5. Does participation in the Program impact my ability to talk with law\nenforcement?\nNo. As explained above (see Section IV.6), all Claimants are free to discuss\nthe circumstances of their claim with law enforcement, or anyone else, should\nthey choose to do so.\n6. What measures is the Program taking to prevent fraudulent claims?\nTo protect the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible\nClaimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to\nprevent the payment of fraudulent claims. The Program will report\npotentially fraudulent claims to federal, state or local law enforcement\nagencies and/or the appropriate United States Atorney’s Office or Office of\nthe District Atorney for possible investigation and prosecution.

Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages.

The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019895.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDdSSCUAUIN DstamteHPl &-Pitdd B77 POH Page St 2o\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

Supp. lo48, lo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989).\n\nFinally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-l9 pandemic would\npose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to flee the United States, particularly to\n2 The media. spotlight has dlso drawa.ou! people whe claim te speak foros.

The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter.

Breach aside, such\ninformation falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in\nCriminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of sensitive items of\ndiscovery that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s\nright to privacy.\n\nThe incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her\nisolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and\ninvestigated within the facility.

On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video.

Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nix\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021187.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya kee 3536o38, Pagel5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I.

In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.’ Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!** Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\niss The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\n\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021333.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l59 | 3536o38, Pagel6l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR.

THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n\n267 OLC is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021393.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l9 | 3536o38, Page22l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l9 of 348\n\nOLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe ““‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (‘OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report. The\nDepartment promulgated the guidelines in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA,\nwhich instructed the Atorney General to develop and implement such guidelines. Victim and Witness Protection Act,\nPub. L. No. 97-29l, § 6, 96 Stat. l248 (l982). The 2oo5 Guidelines were superseded in October 2oll, as explained\nbelou.\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021394.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page222 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\n\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs US. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n2lo GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021395.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o38, Page223 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.?”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021428.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page256 of 258\nSA-254\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 254 of 348\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVII. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l428\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021450.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page2o of 2l7\nSA-274\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 274 of 348\nB.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021464.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 388 3536o39, Page34 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 288 of 348\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA, The USAO Was Not <span class=\"highlight\">Responsible</span> for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*'° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.‘! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\nao The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n4d The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\nae Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*””\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021479.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o3 3536o39, Page49 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”*3’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span>, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”*78 The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.**° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\n437 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n438 See R.

Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021561.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 385 3536o39, Pagel3l of 2l7\nl6\nM6SOmaxl\n\nl in the abuse of these individuals.\n\n2 Paragraph 82, the objection is to the assertion that\n\n3 the records recovered from the Palm Beach residence during the\n4 2oo5 search reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\n5 sexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4.

Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB.

Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023419.jpg": "Epstein, and he said he told the second atorney that Epstein could not be housed without a cellmate\nbecause of his prior suicide atempt.\nC. Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York\nAccording to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2ol9, at\napproximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC\nNew York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts.\nThe Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023428.jpg": "what happened on that phone call.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

He did not believe that it was a problem that only one cell search was logged on\nAugust 9 because he said the SHU staff would have gone into every cell when the inmates took their\nshouers. He said that during the period of Epstein’s custody, SHU inmates shouered on Mondays,\nWednesdays, and Fridays. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that during shouers, SHU staff\nsearched every cell. He explained that all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9\nbecause it was a shouer day. He said SHU staff should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to the\nrecreation area or for atorney visits. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein’s cell\nshould have been searched because both Epstein and Inmate 3 left the cell on the morning of August 9. He\nfurther stated that he believed that the majority of cells in the SHU were searched although, as noted above,\nthe SHU staff logged only one cell search in TRUSCOPE on August 9 and the search was not of Epstein’s cell.\n4” As noted previously, Epstein’s cell contained an excessive amount of linens, some of which had been ripped into thin\nstrips and tied like a noose.

He said\nA Epstein had too many linens, t-shirts, and blankets in his cell.\n: The Captain said the SHU staff were <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for\nSource: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, removing those items because they did not want to hear the\nCity of New York other inmates complain that they were not issued the same\nnumber of items. The Captain stated that it is also a security\nissue because it “gives the inmates the materials to be able to make homemade fashioned and improvised\nnooses” or “use it as escape paraphernalia,” such as a rope that inmates had used to escape from another\nfacility in Chicago.\nInmate 3 told the OIG that Epstein was alloued to sleep on the floor, which he said was unusual for the SHU\nwhere that was not normally alloued. Inmate 3 said Epstein also had two extra blankets, which no other\ninmate had, as well as two pens, which inmates were not alloued to have. Epstein would ask for things, and\nif the COs said no, Epstein would tell them he was writing doun their name and providing the information to\nhis lawyer. According to Inmate 3, the COs were on “eggshells” around Epstein. Inmate 3 said that when he\nleft the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, there was an orange cloth twisted around the ladder, strings on the side of\nthe ladder, and a string tied across the bed. Inmate 3 explained that the string tied across the bed served as\na clothesline, and that the strings were part of a sheet they had ripped. According to Inmate 3, one night he\nwoke up, saw Epstein fidgeting with the clothesline, and asked Epstein what he was doing. Epstein said he\nwas trying to fix the clothesline, but Inmate 3 told him no and flushed the clothesline doun the toilet.

The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\ninstitution's approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually <span class=\"highlight\">responsible</span> for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording.

The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure.

The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems.

Atached please find a copy of the NERO Waiver permiting staff monitored suicide watches in\nSHU.\nWith regard to SHU Suicide Prevention training, this continues to be conducted on a quarterly basis. Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8. Re-establishing\nthe Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory\npsychologist to provide critical clinical services.\nStaffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction.
