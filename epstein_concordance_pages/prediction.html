See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates.

As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be completed within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged conspiracy by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the discretion to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than sufficient time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially estimated that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury selection and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4). The\nGovernment has nou added only one week to that <span class=\"highlight\">prediction</span>, estimating that its case-in-chief may\nlast up to three weeks and proposing that the Court reserve four weeks in total for trial. Although\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">prediction</span> includes an estimate of any anticipated cross-examination and defense case, the\nGovernment, of course, cannot be certain hou long such defense presentations will take during\ntrial. Moreover, given that the parties have consented to the use of jury questionnaires, the\nGovernment’s hope is that their use will expedite jury selection in order to preserve as many days\nas possible for the trial beginning on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3946\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2o of 349\nWhy don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him?\nAcosta also weighed in, sending both Villafafia and Sloman an email with a subject line\nthat read “This has to stop,” in which he stated:\n\nJust read the leter.\n\nl.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the <span class=\"highlight\">prediction</span>\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Harrelson, 7l3 F.2d ll4, ll8 (Sth\nCir.l983) (finding that “[c]ommon sense tells us that a juror who has once indicated a desire to\nbe let alone and to put the mater of his jury service behind him by declining to be interviewed\nregarding it is unlikely to change his mind; and if he does, he is always free to initiate an\ninterview”).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4o of55\nidentified a total of thirty-two minor victims, including Carolyn and Virginia.’ Of those thirty-\ntwo individuals, thirteen appear in the message pads, again including Carolyn and Virginia.\n\nThe Government notes that, from interviewing many of these victims during the course of\nits investigation, the Government has learned that, in the later phases of the conspiracy, victims\nprimarily scheduled appointments with—and interfaced with—Epstein’s personal assistants, who\nwere in their early twenties.® Although the Government does not seek to include these minors as\nvictims for purposes of the Guidelines calculation, the scope of the pyramid scheme that the\ndefendant helped devise with Epstein bears emphasis when evaluating the harms that the\ndefendant’s criminal conduct ultimately caused.\n\nVictim Impact\n\nIt is difficult to capture in words the harm that Maxwell caused to her victims. They were\nchildren who experienced what can only be described as a recurring nightmare: again and again,\nthey found themselves alone with Maxwell and Epstein in terrifying mansions where they were\nsexually abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an exploitative relationship with\nMaxwell and Epstein that, for many victims, lasted for years.\n\nOften, in cases involving sexual exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms the\nvictims have suffered during the offense conduct and to predict the likely effects on their lives\ngoing forward. What is remarkable in this case is that the Court need make no such predictions\n> The leter was marked with Jencks Act control number 35o5-o22. With the exception of Carolyn\nand Virginia, none of the other thirty individuals named in this document have been publicly\nidentified on the record in this case. Those victims retain significant privacy interests.\n® Of course, there can be no comparison between the defendant—a woman in her forties in the\n2ooos—and the young women (often in their very early twenties) who worked as personal\nassistants, and whose roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from those of the\ndefendant.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l98 of 262 l9o9\nLC8VMAX6 Rodgers —- cross\nl Logbook which you've reviewed prior to testifying today?\n2 A.

The purpose of the agreement was not an out of court\nsetlement. Seems that they can’t take no. Let’s talk re hou to\nproceed. I’m not sure we will ever agree on a leter [to the special\nmaster about hou to select an atorney representative] at this point.\n\nNotwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and <span class=\"highlight\">prediction</span>, after Sloman sent to Lefkouitz a new\ndraft addendum and they spoke by phone, the parties reached agreement on the addendum’s\nterms.'*7\n\nOn October 25, 2oo7, Sloman sent a leter to the person whom the USAO had selected to\nserve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties. A few days later, on October 29,\n2oo7, Epstein and his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.'** Villafafia’s\nname was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafafia’s request, Sloman signed the\naddendum for her on behalf of the USAO.\n\nVillafafia later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which\napparently related to the defense atorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial\nselection of the private atorney to assist the victims. Villafafia explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or\n\nspoken to [the private atorney] before I asked him if he would be\n\nwilling to take on this case... . But as soon as you mentioned the\n\nappearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and\n\nagreed that the Special Master would be a safer route.
