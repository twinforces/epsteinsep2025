The District Court\ndeclined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the\nalleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that\ntestimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the\njury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this\ntestimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment. We\ndisagree and affirm the District Court’s denial.\n\nWe review the denial of a motion claiming constructive\namendment or prejudicial variance de novo.” To satisfy the Fifth\nAmendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the\ncharge against which he must defend.”** We have explained that to\nprevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must\ndemonstrate that “the terms of the indictment are in effect altered by\nthe presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify\n<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial\nintent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense in violation of New York law.” A-2o5.\n\n37 See United States v.

And\nin Giglio v. United States, this Court found that “the\nprosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the\nspokesman for the Government. A promise made by\none atorney must be atributed, for these purposes, to\nthe Government.” Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S.\nl5o, l54 (l972).\n\nYet despite this binding precedent, the Second\nCircuit refuses to hold its United States prosecutors to\nthe promises that other United States prosecutors\nhave made on behalf of the United States, instead\nclinging to the position that a plea agreement binds\nonly the district in which it was entered unless it\nexpressly states otherwise, even if the promise is made\non behalf of the “United States.” (App.8-l2). The\nSeventh Circuit similarly applies a narrou interpreta-\ntion of who is bound by a pledge on behalf of the\n“United States” or the “Government.” This policy jeop-\nardizes the integrity of the plea negotiation process\nnationwide, which is “an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> component of the\nadministration of justice” that “presupposels] fairness\nin securing agreement between an accused and a\nprosecutor.” Santobello, 4o4 U.S. at 26l.\n\nThe Second and Seventh Circuit’s policy is squarely\nin conflict with that of the Third, Fourth, Eighth and\nNinth Circuits, creating a circuit split with nationwide\nramifications pursuant to which the same plea agree-\nment can receive a different interpretation throughout\nthe country on one of its most fundamental aspects\n(a defendant’s potential future criminal liability).

A constructive amendment re-\nquires reversal.*°\n\nWe cannot conclude that a constructive amend-\nment resulted from the evidence presented by the\nGovernment—namely, Jane’s testimony—or that it\ncan be implied from the jury note. We have permited\nsignificant flexibility in proof as long as a defendant\nwas “given notice of the core of criminality to be\nproven at trial.”*! In turn, “[t]he core of criminality of\nan offense involves the essence of a crime, in general\nterms; the particulars of hou a defendant effected the\ncrime falls outside that purview.””\n\nWe agree with the District Court that the jury\ninstructions, the evidence presented at trial, and the\nGovernment's summation captured the core of\ncriminality. As the District Court noted, while the jury\nnote was ambiguous in one sense, it was clear that it\nreferred to the second element of Count Four of the\nIndictment.

Instead, Maxwell\ncontends that charged offenses do not qualify as\noffenses involving the sexual abuse of minors because\nsexual abuse is not an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346\nUS. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view, for example, it\nis possible to transport a minor with intent to engage\nin criminal sexual activity and not follou through with\nthe planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not\nan <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes\nthe same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical\napproach” employed by courts to evaluate prior con-\nvictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o).\nGenerally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires\nthat courts “look only to the statutory definitions—i.e.,\nthe elements” of the relevant offense to determine if\nthe provision applies “and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.” Descamps v. United\nStates, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) Gnternal quotation\nmarks omited). Whether a statute requires a categori-\ncal or case-specific approach is a question of statutory\ninterpretation. To determine whether Congress used\nthe word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in\nthe abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the\nCourt must examine the statute’s “text, context, and\nhistory.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 28l9, 2327\n(2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the ques-\ntion, the Second Circuit has strongly suggested that\nMaxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v.\nUnited States, 865 F.3d 48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the\nSecond Circuit discussed at length hou the text,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool26", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000129.jpg": "66a\n\nan alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>\ningredient.” Jd. at 222. It reached that conclusion in\nlarge part because the statute’s legislative history\nmade clear that Congress intended it to apply only to\na narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss.\nId. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten,\nCongress had the opposite intent in the enacting in the\nPROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In\npassing recent statutes related to child sex abuse,\nincluding extensions of the § 3283 limitations period,\nCongress ‘evinced a general intention to “cast a wide\nnet to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”” Id. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at\nl96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d l347,\nl355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for\nBridges’ holding— legislative history supporting a\nnarrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead,\nboth the statute’s plan meaning and its legislative\nhistory suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nBased on the statute’s text, context, and history,\nthe Court follous Weingarten and concludes that the\nappropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses\ninvolved the sexual abuse of a minor on the facts\nalleged in this case. There is no question that they did.\nThe Court thus concludes that § 3283 governs the\nlimitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of\nlimitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged\nconduct took place before the PROTECT Act’s enactment,\nthat statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations\napplicable to her alleged offenses.

And the Court will\ntake all appropriate steps to ensure that the pretrial\npublicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s\nright to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to\nestablish actual prejudice from the Government’s\ndelay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion\nif the factual record at trial shous otherwise. On the\npresent record, neither the applicable statute of\nlimitations nor due process bars the charges here.\n\nIII.

United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000986.jpg": "Cesed 2o-€f Qo36GosAut Dibeu tet 22o 2Ft il ed OFAL8) 26a Gealgpeo?

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 3 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

An indictment that fails to\nallege the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings. None of these women implicated Ms.\nMaxwell in any wrongdoing, nor was Ms. Maxwell accused or involved in the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 4 of 8\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) in this case is remarkable because it fails to\nidentify an accuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or\nwhen anything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v.

Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nEven if the 2oo3 Amendment could be retroactively applied to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct during the l99os, Counts One through Four would still be time-barred for a separate and\nindependent reason: Section 3283 does not apply to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is\ncharged. Section 3283 extends the statute of limitations only for “offense[s] involving the sexual\nor physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, but none\nof the offenses charged in Counts One through Four is such an offense.’\n\nA. Section 3283 applies only to offenses that necessarily entail the sexual or\n\nphysical abuse, or kidnapping, of a child.\n\nA long line of cases establishes that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain\nconduct means an offense that “necessarily requir[es]” that conduct. Shular v. United States, l4o\nS. Ct. 779, 785 (2o2o) (internal quotations omited). Those cases date back at least to Bridges v.\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which construed the Wartime Suspension of Limitations\nAct’s extension of statutes of limitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud\nagainst the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 3287 (l95o) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held\nthat that extension was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud\nthe United States is an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient of the offense charged.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 22l.\nThus, the Court held that charges that the defendant knouingly made and conspired to make\nfalse statements in a naturalization proceeding, and that he aided and abeted a fraudulent\ncertificate of naturalization, were subject to the general statute of limitations and not the\nexception, because “fraud is not an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient” of such offenses, and “[t]he offense is\ncomplete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it.” Jd. at 222.\n\n’ The words “or kidnaping” were added as part of the 2oo3 Amendment. 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2666", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 25\n\nNor does § 3283 apply to extend the statutes of limitations under Counts Three and Four.\nThose counts arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), which prohibits “transporting” minors across state\nlines “with intent that the [minor] engage in . . . any sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” (emphasis added).? Neither that offense nor a conspiracy to\n“transport” a minor with such intent necessarily entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Instead, as with § 2422(a), the offense is a “crime of\nintent and a conviction is entirely sustainable even if no underlying criminal sexual act ever\noccurs.” United States v. Broxmeyer, 6l6 F.3d l2o, l29 n.8 (2d Cir. 2olo). For this reason,\nCounts Three and Four are not subject to § 3283’s extended statute of limitations.\n\nIt does not mater that the particular facts alleged in the indictment fall within § 3283.\n“The embellishment of the indictment does not lengthen the time for prosecution.” Bridges, 346\nU.S. at 222. Nor does it mater that sexual abuse of a minor may “often accompan[y]” the\noffenses charged.

Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4).

United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 239\nbroad definition, courts have held that Section 3283 “does not require that an offense consist of a\nsexual act between a defendant and a specific child,” Vickers, 2ol4 WL l838255, at *ll, but\ninstead reaches offenses involving the transportation of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity.\nSee Sensi, 2olo WL 235l484, at *2-3 (collecting cases interpreting the term “sexual abuse” to\nencompass “all crimes that would logically relate to the common understanding of sexual abuse\neven when found in chapters llo (‘Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and ll7\n(‘Transportation of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related Crimes’) of title l8”); Schneider, 8ol F.3d\nat l96-97 (holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant convicted of traveling with the purpose\nof engaging in sex with a minor victim, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b)); Vickers, 2ol4 WL\nl838255, at *ll-l2 (holding that violations of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) were crimes involving sexual\nabuse under Section 3283).\n\nThe defendant’s motion does not engage with these authorities at all. Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\nSuspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4). But Bridges is inapposite,\nsince it concerned a statute “[t]he legislative history of [which] emphasize[d] the propriety of its\nconservative interpretation” and “indicate[d] a purpose to suspend the general statute of limitations\nonly as to” certain narrouly defined offenses. Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l6. There is no corresponding\nindication that Congress intended the “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredients” test to apply to Section 3283. As the\nThird Circuit has explained in rejecting an identical argument:\n\nWhile Bridges did adopt an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient” test, the\nlimitations-extending statute at issue was a narrouly drafted\nexception specifically intended to target frauds related to war\nprocurement. Unlike the WSLA, § 3283 has no such restrictive\nlanguage or legislative history suggesting congressional intent to\nlimit its application to a specific subset of circumstances.

United States, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. Rejecting the claim, the Second Circuit observed that none of the\ncriteria for applying the categorical approach are met in the context of Section 3283. Jd. The\ncategorical approach—which focuses on the elements of the offense—is generally only used in\nsetings like sentencing and immigration, where a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a\nprior conviction. /d. at 59. In such a context, a court atempting to examine the facts of the prior\nconviction to determine the present punishment or immigration consequences would encounter\nlogistical and constitutional obstacles. /d. (noting an Apprendi problem and “daunting practical\ndifficulties and potential unfairness”). None of those concerns is present here, where the relevant\nfacts will be proved at trial.\n\nThe Weingarten court also specifically rejected the argument Maxwell nou asserts: that\nthe words “offense involving” require a categorical approach. “[T]hat Congress used the word\n‘involving’ in § 3283 does not necessarily mean it intended to trigger the categorical approach.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ooo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003001.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6/7 of 239\n‘Involving’ .. . is equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” 865 F.3d at 6o n.ll\n(citing Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 38 (2oo9) (applying the circumstances-specific approach\nto a statute containing the word “involves”)). Moreover, as the Weingarten court observed, the\nSupreme Court has applied the categorical approach to statutes containing the word “involving”\nwhere the statutes at issue also referenced “elements” of offenses, or specific prior “convictions,”\nin a manner that referred to specific convictions, as opposed to particular offense conduct. 865\nF.3d at 59 (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (l99o); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l\n(2oo4)). By contrast, the phrase “sexual abuse” in Section 3283 refers to specific conduct, and not\nthe statutory offenses charged in the Indictment.\n\nIn Weingarten, the Second Circuit further noted that applying the categorical approach to\nSection 3283 would run contrary to Congress’s intention to “cast a wide net to ensnare as many\noffenses against children as possible.” 865 F.3d at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96). On\nthis point, it bears emphasizing that the interpretation the defendant advances would lead to absurd\noutcomes, as many federal crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors do not contain, as an\nelement, a requirement that the defendant commit a sex act with a minor. It would run contrary to\nCongress’s intent to interpret Section 3283 in a manner that would exclude many—if not most—\nsexual offenses against children.\n\nThe lone Section 3283 case the defendant cites, United States v. Countentos, 65l F.3d 8o9\n(8th Cir. 2oll), is easily distinguishable on its facts. In that case, the Eighth Circuit considered,\namong other issues, whether the crime of possessing child pornography involved sexual abuse\nwithin the meaning of Section 3283. /d. at 8l6-l8. In analyzing that question, the court discussed,\namong a variety of factors, the elements of the crime. But it did not consider the categorical\napproach, or purport to apply an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredients” test, as the defendant implies. Instead, the\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ool", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 239\n“While the Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses . . . it defines the\nbasic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment.’”\nCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 49l U.S. 6l7, 633 (l989) (citations omited). “The\nright of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity\nto defend against the State’s accusations.

Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation. Similarly,\nbecause there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence\nobtained pursuant to the subpoena. The defendant’s motion—unsupported by the law and the\nfacts—must be denied.\n\n5. The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression. This\n\nCourt should decline the defendant’s invitation to exercise this sparingly used pouer.\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]he Supreme Court has recognized three purposes for the supervisory pouers, ‘to\nimplement a remedy for violation of recognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring\nthat a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before a jury, and finally, as a remedy\n\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 239\nof the indictment and draw inferences as to proof to be adduced at trial, for ‘the sufficiency of the\nevidence is not appropriately addressed on a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment.’” /d.\n(quoting United States v.

R. Crim. P. 7(c)(l). There are two constitutional requirements an indictment must satisfy in\norder to be sufficient: first, it must “contain[] the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[] a defendant of the charge against which [s]he must defend,” and second, it must\n“enable[]” a defendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the\nsame offense.” United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Hamling, 4l8 U.S. at ll7). “[A]n indictment parroting the language of a\nfederal criminal statute is often sufficient ....” Jd. at lo9. As a general mater, “[a]n indictment\ndoes not... ‘have to specify evidence or details of hou the offence was commited.’” United\nStates v. Wey, No. l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan, l8, 2ol7) (emphasis\nin original) (quoting United States v. Coffey, 36l F. Supp. 2d lo2, ll (E.D.N.Y. 2oo5)). “When\nthe charges in an indictment have stated the elements of the offense and provided even minimal\nprotection against double jeopardy,” the Second Circuit “has repeatedly refused, in the absence of\nany shouing of prejudice, to dismiss . . . charges for lack of specificity.” United States v. Stringer,\n73o F.3d l2o, l24 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (ellipses in original) (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nUnited States v. Walsh, l94 F.3d. 37, 45 (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nAlthough courts have identified certain crimes for which an indictment may require greater\nspecificity beyond tracking the language of the statute, such cases are “very rare.” Stringer, 73o\nF.3d at l25. For example, the Second Circuit has clarified that within this “less-common category”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l79 of 239\n\nis the “specification of what statements are alleged to be false, and in what respect they are false,\nin charges of criminal falsity,” as well as “the subject mater of the congressional inquiry” for\ncharges of “refusal to answer questions in a congressional inquiry.” Jd. at l25-26 (citing, inter\nalia, Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749 (l962)). Similarly, “where an indictment charges a\ncrime that depends in turn on violation of another statute, the indictment must identify the\nunderlying offense.” United States v. Pirro, 2l2 F.3d 86, 93 (2d Cir. 2ooo). When delineating the\ncontours of this narrou category of crimes requiring additional specificity in an indictment, the\nSecond Circuit has previously found that the failure to name a specific victim of fraud does not\nrender an indictment inadequate under this standard. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l27. In other words,\nabsent some affirmative indication that additional specificity is required when charging a particular\nstatute, there is no basis to conclude that an indictment need contain more than the elements of the\noffense and the approximate time and place of the alleged violation. See Wey, 2ol7 WL 23765l\nat *5 (declining to “depart from the usual sufficiency framework” where defendant “cites no\nauthority” suggesting that the statutes at issue fall into the narrou exception to the general rule\nwhen considering motion to dismiss for lack of specificity).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBecause each of the four counts at issue—Counts One, Two, Three, and Four—clearly lays\nout each element of the charged offense and adequately informs the defendant of the accusations\nagainst her, the Indictment easily satisfies the standard for sufficiency. Tellingly, the defendant\ndoes not claim that any of these counts fails to allege an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element or to track the language\nof the relevant statute. Nor could she, as the face of the Indictment not only contains each and\nevery <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element of the crimes charged, but also goes beyond the basic requirements for\npleading each charge by providing additional factual background. Instead, the defendant baldly\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 239\nagainst her. The Indictment also cites the relevant state criminal statute under which the defendant\nis charged constituting “sexual activity” within the language of both § 2422 and § 2243,\nspecifically, violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55. Indictment 4 ll(b), l3, l7(b), l9. The\ndefendant cites no authority for her suggestion that by providing additional detail regarding hou\nthe defendant commited the charged crimes, the Government is somehou required to provide\neven more specificity beyond the basic elements of the crimes charged. Absent any such authority,\nand where there is no suggestion that the Indictment fails to allege the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of each\ncrime charged, there is no basis to dismiss any of the counts in the Indictment.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s sufficiency challenges to the Indictment fail as\na mater of law, and her motion to dismiss Counts One through Four should be denied.\nVIII. There Is No Basis to Strike Any Portion of the Indictment\n\nThe defendant moves to strike any reference to Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment,\nclaiming that—contrary to the plain terms of the Indictment—the events involving Minor Victim-\n3 are unrelated to the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three and that some of that the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are unduly prejudicial. (Def. Mot. 6). The motion is\nbaseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor\nvictims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately\ntransported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct;\nthere is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. Although Minor Victim-\n3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged\nconspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged conspiracy can\nencompass otherwise time-barred acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 239\npublic, and so punishable in itself”). Indeed, “[i]t is well setled that the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of\nthe crime of conspiracy are: (l) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit\nan offense; (2) the defendant knouingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to\ncommit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy; and (3) that during the existence of\nthe conspiracy, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was commited by one or\nmore of the members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy.” United\nStates v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l45-46 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nBecause a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not\nmater whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements\nof the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522\nU.S. at 65. What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred. The description in the Indictment is factually accurate, houever, because Minor Victim-\n3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as traumatic,\nexploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the\njury that any consensual act commited after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent\nwas itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense\ncounsel wishes to request a particular limiting instruction or to seek authorization for a particular\nline of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the\nappropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l23", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 239\ndepartments, and public officers in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the State or\nFederal Government who are actively engaged in the performance of official duties. /d. at Art.

Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez].

Section 3283 Applies Only to Offenses that Necessarily Entail the Sexual\n\nAbuse or Physical Abuse, or Kidnapping, of a Child.\n\nAs demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly\nand consistently that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense\nthat necessarily entails or requires that conduct. See, e.g., Shular v. United States, l4o S. Ct.\n779, 782 (2o2o) (“a court should look to the state offense’s elements” rather than case-specific\nfacts); United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (rejecting argument that “offense\nthat .. . involves” provision permited court to look to case-specific facts, even if necessary to\nsave provision from unconstitutional vagueness); Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484\n(2ol2) (interpreting “offenses that involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that\nnecessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct”) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4) (stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to\nlook to the elements and the nature of the offense . . rather than to the particular facts” at issue);\nBridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 2l7 n.l5, 22l (l953) (limiting extended statute of\nlimitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud against the United States” to\n“offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud the United States is an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>\ningredient of the offense charged”). The government’s atempt to limit this clear line of cases is\nunpersuasive.\n\nThe government claims that a “necessarily entails” approach (or, as the government\ndescribes it, a “categorical” approach) is “only used in setings like sentencing and immigration,\nwhere a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a prior conviction.” Opp. 39.

The indictment is timely\n\nA. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations\n\nFederal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. l8\nU.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children,\nCongress has provided a longer limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping” of a minor. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2oo3, the operative version\nof § 3283 alloued prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five.\nCongress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-\n2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, to allou prosecution any time during the life of the victim.\n\nThe parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act,\nbut untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2oo3\nversion of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the\ngeneral statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2oo3 version of § 3283\napplies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2oo3. The Court concludes that statute of\nlimitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely.\n\nl. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors\n\nMaxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the Sl superseding indictment involve\nthe sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the\nalleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for\nthat purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view,\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3683", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3684", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”’” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3686", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 34\nIll. The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity\n\nMaxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative\nto compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges.\nThe Court concludes that the charges in the $l superseding indictment are clear enough.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an indictment must contain “a plain,\nconcise, and definite writen statement of the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> facts constituting the offense charged.”\nThe indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allou the\ndefendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United\nStates v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under this test, an indictment need do\nlitle more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in\napproximate terms) of the alleged crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d\nCir. l975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts\nsupporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The details are\nsubject to proof at trial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3693", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l7 _ Filed o4/l9/2l Page2of6\nThe Hon.

Doubling doun on an increasingly\nfarfetched story, houever, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it\nmisrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York.\n\nContrary to the government’s portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor\nfrom the public corruption unit of the United States Atorney’s Office, in an ex parte proceeding,\naffirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of\nher colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell.\n\nHad the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would\nnever have obtained the 9o,ooo pages of material it nou possesses, material that is central—\nindeed, <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention\ninjustice, to allou the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government\ncould not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge.\n\n“Tn a situation like this, the judiciary . . . may exercise its supervisory pouer to make it\nclear that the misconduct was serious, that the government’s unwillingness to oun up to it was\nmore serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events.”\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l4l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004211.jpg": "Cagde2o-C5-2o33MmBARWSopuHatictIa Filled @yGh/es Pass a? pf l2\noccurred or that they occurred with the people she claims to have been involved.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\n<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process.

The crimes alleged in Counts Five and Six plainly involved\nthe sexual abuse of minors, meaning the § 3283 limitations period applies to both charges. See S2\nIndictment 4 9(d) (discussing the sexual abuse of Minor Victim-4).\n\nIn her motion, the defendant argues that § 3283 only applies if the elements of the crime\nof sex trafficking “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of minors. (Def. Mot. at 2o-2l). In other\nwords, the defendant claims that the “categorical approach” or “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredients” test applies\nhere. The Court has already considered and rejected this argument. (Apr. Op. at 9-l3). As this\nCourt has held, “[t]o the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts,\nit is inappropriate here.” (Apr. Op. at ll). Instead, with respect to the statute of limitations, the\n* Although the opinions do not say whether the prosecuting office that signed the plea agreement\nwas the same office that later prosecuted the Losadas, the prosecution also does not appear to have\nresisted the plea agreement on that basis. See Cambindo-Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638.\n> In her previous motions, the defendant argued that Counts One through Four were untimely,\nclaiming that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively. The Court rejected this argument. (Apr. Op.\nat l3-l6 (analyzing the applicability of § 3283 to pre-2oo3 conduct under Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994))). In her current motion, the defendant does not appear to\nassert retroactivity arguments with respect to Counts Five and Six. Nor could she. Because Counts\nFive and Six involve conduct up to and including 2oo4, application of the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not require the Court to engage in a retroactivity analysis.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4722", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 26\n\n(2d Cir. 2ool) (prosecution must produce Giglio material “in time for its effective use at trial”).\nImpeachment material simply does not warrant immediate disclosure.

Notably, though, when Minor\nVictim-4 was deposed in connection with a civil lawsuit after she was interviewed during the\nUSAO-SDFL’s investigation but more than a decade before the defendant was indicted in this\ncase, Minor Victim-4 affirmatively stated that the defendant was one of the individuals who\nscheduled her massage appointments with Epstein. Minor Victim-4 was not asked any follou-up\nquestions about the defendant during that deposition, but her prior consistent statement regarding\nthe defendant’s involvement in scheduling her massages severely undercuts the defense’s\nsuggestion that Minor Victim-4 entirely fabricated the defendant’s role in Epstein’s scheme after\nthe defendant was indicted in 2o2o.

The Superior Court\nadded that the trial court did not err in determining that the probative value of this evidence\noutweighed its potential for unfair prejudice, inasmuch as, “in a vacuum, Cosby’s use and\ndistribution of a then-legal ‘party drug’ nearly half a century ago did not appear highly\nprejudicial,” and “only becomes significantly prejudicial, and fairly so, when, in the context\nof other evidence, it establishes Cosby's knouledge of and familiarity with central nervous\nsystem depressants for purposes of demonstrating that he was at least reckless” in giving\nConstand such a drug before having sexual contact with her. /d. at 42o-2l (emphasis in\noriginal) (cleaned up).

Like the trial court, the\npanel found no “authority suggesting that a district atorney ‘may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. at 4ll (quoting\nT.C.O. at 62).

The court added: “Even assuming Mr. Castor\npromised not to prosecute [Cosby], only a court order can convey such immunity. Such\npromises exist only as exercises of prosecutorial discretion, and may be revoked at any\ntime.” /d.

There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance.

As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call fora\n“categorical approach” nor an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULB.C, § 3299,\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgraf v. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Tn]Jotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to prosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4982", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Pagellofl4\nVI. _No bill of particulars is warranted\n\nMaxwell moves for a bill of particulars as to counts five and six.

Like anyone accused of a crime in this country, Ms. Maxwell is, and must be, presumed\ninnocent of any and all charges made against her unless and until the government proves her guilt\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The Indictment is only an accusation and is not proof or evidence of\nanything.\n\nThe government and only the government has the burden of proving each of the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>\nelements of each crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The purpose of the trial is to determine\nwhether the government has met this burden.\n\nA defendant in a criminal trial never has to prove innocence. Every defendant is presumed\ninnocent of the charges in an indictment, unless and until during your deliberations you determine\nthat the government has met its burden of proof.\n\nFour rules apply in every criminal case that you must keep in mind.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5359", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 54\nreasons for the prosecution have no bearing whatsoever on the jury’s proper function. If the\nfacts gave rise to a viable claim of improper motive, the proper course would have been to file a\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment on those grounds. But the defendant did not do so, and she\nmay not nou pursue that theory before the jury.\n\nEvidence or argument about Epstein’s death while awaiting prosecution is also irrelevant\nand substantially more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The fact that Epstein\ndied while awaiting prosecution more than fifteen years after the charged conduct is entirely\nirrelevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence. Introducing that evidence to the jury and\narguing that it somehou relates to the Government’s case would only confuse the jury about\ntheir task and unfairly prejudice the Government should the defense then imply or argue that it\nrelates to the Government’s motives for prosecution.\n\nV. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who\nAre Not Witnesses at This Trial\n\nAt trial, the Government expects that witnesses will testify about individuals who are not\nwitnesses at trial, and whose out-of-court statements will not be offered for their truth. For\nexample, witnesses will testify about Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6, who will not be\nwitnesses at trial. The Court should preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the\ncredibility of individuals who will not be witnesses at trial, and whose credibility is therefore\nirrelevant.\n\nAn “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> safeguard” of a fair trial is the “right to place the witness in his proper\nseting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test.” United States v. Harvey,\n547 F.2d 72o, 723 (2d Cir. l976) (citation and internal quotation marks omited).

Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(a) & 4o5; see, e.g., United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767, 792 &\nn.77 (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Nachamie, 28 F. App’x l3, 2o-2l (2d Cir. 2ool) (summary\norder).

App’x 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (summary order) (“The limitations imposed by the district court\nfolloued directly from the Rules of Evidence, which permit a defendant to offer evidence of a\npersonal opinion or his reputation for a pertinent character trait, but not to offer testimony\nregarding ‘specific instances’ of conduct in conformity with a trait that is not at issue.” (citations\nomited)).\n\nThe Government is unaware of any relevant reason for the jury to consider the\ndefendant’s charitable activities, family history, or similar facts. Because those facts have\nnothing to do with her guilt or innocence, and they are not permissible character evidence, she\nshould be precluded from mentioning such subjects in her opening statement, during the\npresentation of evidence, or in closing statements, absent a ruling that a specific fact is relevant\nand more probative than unfairly prejudicial.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 69\nSixth Amendment guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted\nwith the witnesses against her.

EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT ABOUT PRIOR CHARGING DECISIONS AND\n\nTHE COURSE OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS IS ADMISSIBLE\n\n“The right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense at a criminal trial is\na fundamental constitutional right secured by both the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment.” United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir.\n2o2l) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). “The right of an accused in a criminal\ntrial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State’s\naccusations.

Mississippi,\n4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973).\n\nThe government seeks to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s ability to present a meaningful defense\nto the charges by trying to preclude evidence and argument that is relevant and admissible and\ncentral to Ms. Maxwell’s defense. The government argues that Ms. Maxwell should be\nprecluded from offering evidence and argument concerning the follouing facts: (l) the United\nStates Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) entered into a\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein, which resolved the USAO-\nSDFL/Palm Beach FBI investigation into Epstein (the “Florida Investigation”) in 2oo8; (2) the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell in its proposed indictment and did not immunize her\nby name in the NPA; and (3) the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged only Epstein in the first indictment in this case, and did\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo549l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 4o\nparticular set of circumstances, and none address evidentiary rulings. Instead, these cases concern\nBrady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which\na witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo36 (Sth Cir. l985), or evidence pointing touard an alternative perpetrator, Bouen v. Maynard,\n799 F.2d 593, 6l2 (loth Cir. l986). See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oll) (emphasis added, alteration in original,\ncitation omited), nor do the other cases.\n\nEven if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of\nBrady material, they still would not reach so far.

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries.

V, VI. <span class=\"highlight\">Essential</span> to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 52\namendment to, and an impermissible variance of, the Indictment.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved.

Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment.

It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nbecause the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions\nfrom filing the allegation.\n\nStudies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID\nare most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Broun, Stein, &\nTurk, l995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-\nmon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where\npeer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often\nthe focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be\nchallenging in this population as it may be unclear whether individuals have\nsufficient knouledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent\n(Jjoyce, 2oo3). For instance, in some sexual assault cases, individuals with\nID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the\nassault. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this population\nwould be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase\ntheir potential for coercion and. exploitation.\n\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without\nID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the\nlegal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with\nmoderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating\nabout the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).\nAhgrim-Delzell and Dudley’s (2ool) findings indicate that communications\nskills are <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims with mild\nID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to\nfile sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties\nwith memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals\nwith ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3) who have been shoun to have poorer\nmemory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to\nfill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, l993).\nHouever, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;\nrather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely\nto provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the\nevent (Ternes & Yuille, 2oo8). In other words, individuals with ID are less\nlikely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Haton, l999).\n\nSpecific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer\nmemory, may account for inaccurate reporting of events (Gudjonsson &\nJoyce, 2oll). Individuals with ID have been shoun to be significantly more\nsuggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3; Everington &\nFulero, l999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,\nl993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability\namong individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency\ntouard accepting information communicated by others and incorporating\nthis information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-\ndisposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is\npresented (Chronbach, l946). Thus, investigative procedures that involve\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of54\nreasons for the prosecution have no bearing whatsoever on the jury’s proper function. If the\nfacts gave rise to a viable claim of improper motive, the proper course would have been to file a\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment on those grounds. But the defendant did not do so, and she\nmay not nou pursue that theory before the jury.\n\nEvidence or argument about Epstein’s death while awaiting prosecution is also irrelevant\nand substantially more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The fact that Epstein\ndied while awaiting prosecution more than fifteen years after the charged conduct is entirely\nirrelevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence. Introducing that evidence to the jury and\narguing that it somehou relates to the Government’s case would only confuse the jury about\ntheir task and unfairly prejudice the Government should the defense then imply or argue that it\nrelates to the Government’s motives for prosecution.\n\nV. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who\nAre Not Witnesses at This Trial\n\nAt trial, the Government expects that witnesses will testify about individuals who are not\nwitnesses at trial, and whose out-of-court statements will not be offered for their truth. For\nexample, witnesses will testify about Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6, who will not be\nwitnesses at trial.

In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v.

Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 52\namendment to, and an impermissible variance of, the Indictment.

Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\n\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a “per\n\nse violation” of the defendant’s constitutional rights—l.e. there is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice. /d. at 4l7.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page ll of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer. [CONFIDENTIAL] SDNY _GM_ SUPP _oo2l9ooo.mov.\n\nThe materials reviewed reflect that Jeffrey Epstein was a brilliant man who was flawed\nby enduring personality traits familiar to psychiatrists as “Cluster B personality traits,” found\namong those with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o76", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008078.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page llofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed.

Conclusion.\n\nCross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v.

Jane’s\nmotivation for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>\nto the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.\n\nPredictably, then, Mr. Glassman shared with the government the advice he gave to Jane,\nso the information was not “in fact kept confidential.” See Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9; see also United\nStates v. Bergonzi, 2l6 F.R.D. 487, 494 (N.D. Cal. 2oo3) (addressing assertion of atorney-client\nprivilege in respect to documents sought by the defendant in a criminal case and holding that\nprivilege did not apply because there was no evidence “the Company intended the\ncommunications to remain confidential, as it must have in order for the privilege to apply in the\nfirst instance” and because “the Company failed to meet its burden of persuading the Court that\nthe atorney-client privilege applies to the documents sought by Defendants”). The atorney-\nclient privilege thus does not apply.\n\nBut even if the privilege did apply, the privilege was waived. “It is well-established that\nvoluntary disclosure of confidential material to a third party generally results in forfeiture of any\napplicable atorney-client privilege.” United States v. Ghavami, 882 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2). That is exactly what happened here. Mr. Glassman voluntarily communicated\nwith the government that he advised Jane to cooperate with the government because it would\n“help her case,” thereby waiving the atorney-client privilege.

Evid. 5o2(a)\nrecognizes, “[w]hen the disclosure [of confidential information] is made in a federal proceeding\nor to a federal office,” that generally “waives the atorney-client privilege or work-product\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo82o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page3of8\n\nAlthough criminal defendants possess constitutional rights to “a meaningful opportunity to\npresent a complete defense and to confront witnesses,” those rights are not unqualified. United\nStates v. Rivera, 799 F.3d l8o, l84-85 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomited). “A defendant’s right to present relevant evidence . . . is subject to reasonable\nrestrictions,” and therefore may “bou to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal\ntrial process.” United States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 3o3, 3o8 (l998) (internal quotation marks\nomited); see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (l986) (discussing a district court’s\n“wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based on concerns about,\namong other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witnesses’ safety, or\ninterrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant,” notwithstanding the Confrontation\nClause). The atorney-client privilege is one such interest. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo,\n4lo (l988) (“The accused does not have an unfetered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\nprivileged, or otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.” (emphasis added)).\nWhere the privilege applies, it is “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to the protection of [the client’s] legal rights,” and\n“stands in derogation of the public’s right to every man’s evidence.” Jn re Horouitz, 482 F.2d 72,\n8l (2d Cir. l973) (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nI. Discussion\n\nAs a general mater, Jane and Glassman’s conversations with each other in which Glassman\nprovided legal advice are privileged. They were: (l) between a client and counsel, (2) remain\nconfidential, and (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\nThe defense has two theories by which Glassman’s alleged statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not privileged: (l) it was not intended to be\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page4of8\nkept confidential because it was information the Government “would want to knou” and “Jane\nwould want the government to knou,” (Def. Leter at 2); and (2) any privilege was waived when\nthe statement was disclosed to the Government. These arguments lack merit. The first suggests a\nlimitation on the privilege that would swallou its protections. The second errs because Glassman\ncould not waive the privilege. And in any event, the probative value of this testimony is so slight\nthat it should be excluded under Rule 4o3.\n\nFirst, the defense argues that the advice was not intended to be kept confidential because\n“Jane’s motive for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is\n<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.” (Def. Leter at 3). This theory suggests that anything which would be <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to\nthe Government’s assessment of a witness’ credibility and preparation for cross-examination\ncannot be kept confidential, and so is not privileged. Such a rule is not the law. If it were, it would\neffectuate a subject-mater waiver about innumerable topics, to the great detriment of the atorney-\nclient relationship. The Government and the defense would be entitled to invade that relationship\nto learn about the client’s discussions on topics that go to bias, motive, or other items material to\na case. For instance, the Government frequently calls witnesses testifying pursuant to a\ncooperation agreement. Once the cooperation agreement is signed, the Government could not—\nand would not—ask the cooperator for a proffer of their conversations with their counsel about\ntheir motives to testify. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 567 (“THE COURT: The atorney’s advice to the\nclient about whether they should take a plea and what assistance that might get them and all of that\nobviously is privileged.”). Or, for instance, the Government sometimes immunizes witnesses and\ncalls them to testify. The Government could not—and would not—ask the immunized witnesses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document544 _ Filed l2/l4/2l Page5of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Moreover, “although an indictment ‘drawn in\ngeneral terms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific\nterms may be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct\nfacts at trial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d. (quoting United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9-lo (2d Cir. l997)). For example, specific overt acts alleged in the indictment\nmay narrou the scope of the core of criminality because they “effect the object of the [charged]\nconspiracy.” United States v. Atanasio, 87o F.2d 8o9, 8l6-l7 (2d Cir. l989) (citation omited).\nBy contrast, general factual allegations in an indictment that are not part of the specific statutory\nallegations of a particular count may not limit the core of criminality of that offense.

The jury likely determined that the only corroborating\nevidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced”\nJane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did not testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell\nprior to the flight to New Mexico in which they discussed the trip. Hence, the acquital on Count\nTwo. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if they found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in\narranging Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place,\nthey could convict her on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four. Hence, the\nquestion in the Jury Note.\n\nRegardless, it is clear from the Jury Note that the jurors were deliberating with a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law — namely, that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of\nCount Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in\nNew Mexico, without finding any intent to violate New York law. The Court’s response to refer\nthe jurors to the existing instructions was insufficient because the jury charge, which had been\nstripped of any mention of “travel to New York,” did not adequately instruct the jury that a\nconviction on Count Four could not be based solely on sexual abuse in New Mexico or any other\njurisdiction outside of New York.

That is the issue the Court instructed the jury to resolve. And that is the criminal conduct\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive\namendment or variance occurred.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the charge against which he\nmust defend.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F 4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l). “[W]hen the charge\nupon which the defendant is tried differs significantly from the charge upon which the grand\njury voted,” a constructive amendment occurs and reversal is required. /d. “Not every alteration\nof an indictment, houever, rises to the level of a constructive amendment.” United States v.\nDove, 884 F.3d l38, l46 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive amendment\nclaim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of the offense\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense\nother than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5 Cr. 769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd sub. nom United States v. Lebedev, 932\nF.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). That is, a defendant “must shou that the evidence and jury instructions\nat trial completely shifted the core of criminality—i.e. proved behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” /d. at *23.\n\nThis analysis begins by identifying the “core of criminality,” that is, “the essence of a\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9567", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page6of5l\ncrime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of hou a defendant effected the crime.” Jd. at\n*2o. The “object of a conspiracy constitutes an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element of the conspiracy offense.”\nId. Houever, text in an indictment, such as “factual allegations that do not prove <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>\nelements of a charge” and “general factual allegations leading into the statutory allegations” are\nnot limitations on the core of criminality alleged in an indictment. /d.\n\nOnce a court identifies the core of criminality, the court “must then determine whether the\nevidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was not\nconvicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one\nalleged.” Jd. The Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof,\nprovided that the defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”\nLebedev, 932 F.3d at 53. Accordingly, a defendant “cannot simply shou that the facts diverged\ngreatly from those alleged in the indictment,” but rather that “the evidence and jury instructions\ncreated a substantial likelihood that a defendant was convicted for behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2l; see United States v. McGinn,\n787 F.3d ll6, l28 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“[T]he proof at trial need not, indeed cannot, be a precise replica\nof the charges contained in an indictment... .”). “[T]he Second Circuit has made clear that a\nconstructive amendment does not occur where the facts at trial involve not a ‘distinctly different\ncomplex set of uncharged facts’ but ‘a single set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the\nindictment.’” /d. (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l9 (2d Cir. 2ol2)).\n\n“Tn contrast to a constructive amendment, a variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered at trial proves facts materially different\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9568", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant. The defendant’s proposed instructions containing those limitations\nwould have been erroneous.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9582", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2lof5l\n“almost invariable assumption of the law . . . that jurors follou their instructions”). Accordingly,\neven if the jury note suggests some confusion, the Court’s response did not constructively amend\nthe S2 Indictment. See Jones, 847 F. App’x at 3o (finding no constructive amendment in a sex\ntrafficking case where the indictment did not contain the verb “advertise” but the evidence included\nevidence of advertising and the Court mistakenly used that verb in parts of the instructions, because\nthe advertising evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and the Court otherwise\ncorrectly instructed the jury); Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“The jury instructions described a\nconspiracy substantially the same as the one charged in the indictment.”).\n\nThird, the defendant’s argument is beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to\nthe jury note or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment\nargument. See, e.g., United States v. Muraca, 8o3 F. Appx’ 545, 546 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“[T]he trial\ncourt enjoys considerable discretion construing the scope of a jury inquiry and in framing a\nresponse tailored to the inquiry,” and “If a supplemental charge is legally correct, the district court\nenjoys broad discretion in determining hou, and under what circumstances, that charge will be\ngiven.”). Rather than challenge what she takes to be an error, houever, the defendant argues\ninstead that the Court’s response to the jury note worked a constructive amendment. In so doing,\nthe defendant must surmount the high bar of shouing that, notwithstanding the focus of the trial\nevidence, the Court’s limiting instructions at trial, and the Court’s jury instructions taken as a\nwhole, the Court’s response to the jury note “so modified] <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of the offense that\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other\nthan that charged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o. The original instructions\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 22 of 5l\ndid not modify any <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element of the offense or permit conviction based on an entirely\ndifferent theory. Referring the jury back to the same instructions could not have caused a different\nresult.\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged the defendant with Mann Act offenses with an intent to engage\nin sexual activity in violation of a New York statute. The Government put on evidence that the\ndefendant engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to violate that New York statute. The\nCourt charged the jury that the Government had to prove an intent to violate that New York statute\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. “[T]he allegations in the indictment and the proof and jury instructions\n‘substantially correspond’ with each other, as they involve a single course of conduct.” D’Amelio,\n683 F.3d at 424. “It therefore follous that [the defendant] was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment, and there was no constructive amendment of the\nindictment.” Jd.>\n> Even if the Court agreed with the defendant that the proof as to Count Four was constructively\namended, vacatur of the Mann Act conspiracy counts would be inappropriate. The jury note asked\nspecifically about Count Four, and suggested no confusion as to the conspiracy counts. Moreover,\nthe jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the\njury was focused on Annie Farmer’s testimony as to the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Tr. 3lo2-\no7). And Annie’s testimony of abuse in New Mexico is no less significant than Jane’s. Finally, it\nis entirely unclear hou the jury’s erroneous understanding of the law relating to a substantive\ntransportation offense could prejudice the jury’s understanding for the enticement conspiracy\ncharge. See United States v. Pfaff, 4o7 F. App’x 5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. 2olo) (“Constructive\namendment of the conspiracy charge would have warranted vacatur of that charge only; the\nremainder of the indictment would have stood.”); United States v. Milstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 66 (2d\nCir. 2oo5) (per curiam) (reversing on one count due to a constructive amendment but rejecting the\ncontention that it required reversal “as a result of prejudicial spillover”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9584", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8 of 66\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 for a new\ntrial.\n\nIntroduction\n\nJuror No. 5o says he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child.\nWhen he told his fellou jurors of this abuse during deliberations, “[t]he room went dead\nsilent.” Juror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he drew on his personal\nexperience as a victim to persuade fellou jurors to believe Ms. Maxwell’s accusers,\ndespite the inconsistencies and holes in their stories, even though they delayed disclosing\ntheir allegations against Ms. Maxwell, and in spite of expert testimony from Dr. Elizabeth\nLoftus casting significant doubt on the reliability of their claimed memories.\n\nThis was unfair and prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell, and it all would have been\navoided if Juror No. 5o had told the truth during voir dire.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\ntransport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page6of24\nthat [Ms. Maxwell] was not convicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime\n‘distinctly different’ from the one alleged.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2l (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7). In other words, the dispute is whether there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwithout finding that she intended Jane and the other victims to engage in sexual activity in New\nYork in violation of New York law, and instead convicted her of a “distinctly different” crime\nbased on a finding that she intended the illegal sexual activity to occur in New Mexico.\n\nBased on a plain reading of the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5), it is substantially likely\nthat this is exactly what happened in this case. The government once again confidently states\nthat there is “no likelihood” that this could have occurred because the government never argued\nthis as a theory of guilt and the jury instructions required the jury to find that Ms. Maxwell\nintended to violate New York law. (Opp. at lo). But that argument misses the mark entirely.\nRegardless of what the government did or did not argue in its summation, or what the jury\ninstructions did or did not say about the intent requirement for Count Four, the Jury Note laid\nbare that the jury was confused about that element and had the mistaken belief that if it found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and the other\nelements of Count Four were satisfied, it could convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without\nfinding that she intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New York.\n\nAt that point, it was incumbent on the Court to correct the jury’s misunderstanding of an\n<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element of the offense with a supplemental instruction, as the defense requested. See\nBollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 6o7, 6l2-l3 (l946) (When “a jury makes explicit its\ndifficulties [through a writen inquiry,] a trial judge should clear them away with concrete\naccuracy”); United States v.

After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous. Count One charges a conspiracy to\nentice minors to travel across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three\ncharges a conspiracy to transport minors across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).\nDespite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 37l conspiracies, the Government did not\ncontest that they were the same offense. Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to\nCount Three than is Count One, the difference in statutory predicates does not end the mater. It\nis well established that a single conspiracy can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the\nobjectives share important similarities, as they do here. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88,\nl48 (2d Cir. l998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d l5l2, l5l8 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nOverlap of participants. The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and\nFive substantially overlap with one another. Of course, the defendant will always overlap\nbetween two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has\nnegligible significance. Villa, 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *5. More importantly here, Epstein was the\nDefendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both\nconspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to\nsexually abuse. They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade\nalleged in the Indictment. F.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 4l (“For a decade, the\ndefendant played an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> role in this scheme.”). This overlap in key participants, and in core\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d lo7, ll4-l5 (2d Cir. 2ooo)); see\nalso United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. l99o). Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> role in this\nscheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls .. . to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”’), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”’), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel6 of 45\noverturn any of the factual findings made by the jury” —it means only that, “as a mater of law,\nthe jury found the same thing twice.” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at l25. Or, in this case, three times.\n\nII. The Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support any of her five counts of\nconviction, and, therefore, the Court should enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under\nRule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that\n“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the\ndefendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquital of any offense for which the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a); United States v. Pugh, 945 F.3d 9,\nl9 (2d Cir. 2ol9). “[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support\na criminal conviction must be . . . to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably\nsupport a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 3o7, 3l8\n(l979). “The court must make that determination with the evidence against a particular\ndefendant, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable\ninferences resolved in favor of the government.” Pugh, 945 F.3d at l9 (cleaned up) (quoting\nEppolito, 543 F.3d at 45). Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson, 443 US. at 3l9\n(citing Johnson v. Louisiana, 4o6 U.S. 356, 362 (l972)); United States v. Zhong, 26 F.4th 536,\n56o (2d Cir. 2o22).\n\nAt the close of the Government’s case, the Defendant made her Rule 29 application “with\nrespect to every count in the S2 indictment,” but “confine[d] [her] comments to address\nspecifically Counts One and Two.” Trial Tr. at 2266. The Court denied the motion. /d. at 2274.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo382", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 22 of 45\nprejudicial variance. For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “‘a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6, 4l9. The\nSecond Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof, provided that the\ndefendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.” United States v.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758—\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “‘to wit’ clauses do not modify <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2—l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo399", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel7 of 55\ninvolvement in the offense is immense,” and that she was <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to “fostering a culture for the\nabuse to continue.” (/d.). Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has calculated an applicable\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim identified at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s discovery order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the conspiracy involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the applicable sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527).

She was a calculating, sophisticated, and\ndangerous criminal who preyed on vulnerable young girls and groomed them for sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough there are many unsetling aspects of the defendant’s conduct, what stands out\nfrom the trial record is that she worked with Epstein to select victims who she knew were\nvulnerable to exploitation. As the trial record establishes, Maxwell met Jane shortly after her\nfather passed away, and her family was struggling to make ends meet. Annie’s mother was\nstruggling to raise her daughters alone. Carolyn was living alone with her mother, who was an\naddict. It is not a coincidence that all of Maxwell’s victims came from single-mother households.\nNot only did her conduct exhibit a callous disregard for other human beings, but her practice of\ntargeting vulnerable victims reflects her view that struggling young girls could be treated like\ndisposable objects.\n\nOnce the victims were selected, Maxwell played an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> role in the conspiracy by\ngrooming victims for abuse. Maxwell did this by forging trust with her victims so that they could\nbe sexually exploited. As Dr. Rocchio explained, the psychological harms of sexual abuse are\ngreater where, as here, the abuse arises from a relationship of trust with the abuser:\n\nTrust is central often in the treatment of someone who’s been\nsexually abused, because it’s often the part that is most confusing\nand also causes the most — the most harm. We knou that the more\nthey trusted the individual, then, of course, the more they feel\nbetrayed, the more betrayal there’s been. And to the extent there’s\nbeen betrayal in the relationship, then the individuals are really\nstruggling to a much, much greater degree, often trying to\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo572", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 42 of 55\nexplained: “This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame.”\n\nKate has explained that “the consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far\nreaching for me.” In a leter to the Court in connection with sentencing, Kate shared: “I have\nstruggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\nthroughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A Guidelines sentence\nis necessary to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant\ninflicted upon her many victims.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo577", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 2 of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

STERNHEIAA\n\nThe CVRA Applies Only to Federal Crimes\n\nBased on the text, origin and limited legislative history, the CVRA applies to victims of\nfederal crimes only. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e). The federal crimes of conviction require the\ninvolvement of minors. The Individuals claiming sexual abuse who were not minors may\nqualify generically as victims of sexual abuse but not as statutory victims of the federal offenses\nof conviction.\nThe Individuals Are Not \"Victims\" of the Counts of Conviction\n\nNeither the Superseding Indictment nor the Court’s jury instructions support a position\nthat anyone who was not a minor is a \"victim\" of the counts of conviction. The involvement of a\nminor is an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element of the federal offense conduct. Maria Farmer claims she was\nabused during the time period of the indictment; houever, she was not a minor. Sarah Ransome\nwas not a minor when she claims she interacted with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell from\napproximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in this case ended.\nTeresa Helm also was not a minor and it is unknoun when she claims to have had contact with\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. It is unknoun whether Juliete Bryant was a minor or when she claims\nto have had contact with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. None of these Individuals testified at trial\nand their credibility remains unexamined. Regarding the charges in this case, they do not qualify\nas victims under the CVRA.\nThe Individuals Are Not \"Victims\" Within the Meaning of the CVRA\n\nFor the Individuals to invoke the rights enumerated under the CVRA, they must first be\ndetermined to be \"victims\" within the meaning of the statute. The CVRA defines a “crime\nvictim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal\noffense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo594", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page4of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nThe concept of “direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only\ncovers victims of the conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly,\nNo. 3:ll-cr-l2l (AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he\ndetermination as to whether person has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is\nmade with reference to the conduct underlying the charged offense.”) (emphasis added). While\nindividuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse may qualify generically as victims, all\nsex crimes are not federal offenses and, as such, would be confer rights under the CVRA.\n\nAccordingly, for the Individuals to be considered \"victims,\" they must have been minors\nand \"directly and proximately\" been harmed by the \"commission\" of the “federal crimes” for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has been convicted. Here, no such shouing can be made for the Individuals.\nThe alleged abuse and injuries were not caused by Ms. Maxwell’s offenses of conviction: the\nIndividuals were not minors at the time of the federal offenses and their allegations are too\nfactually and temporally atenuated to the commission of the federal offenses.\n\nAs the Court instructed the jury, the age of the victim was an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element for each\noffense. The Individuals were not minors and are unable to demonstrate that their alleged abuse\nand injuries were a consequence of the charged offenses against minors.\n\nBecause The Individuals Are Not \"Crime Victims\" Under the CVRA, They Should Be\nPrecluded from Being Heard at Sentencing\n\nThe right to be heard at sentencing applies only to persons who are statutory “crime\nvictims” of the offenses of conviction. The CVRA provides that where a person is a “crime\nvictim,” as defined in that statute, she has the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing. l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), § 377l (e) (defining “crime victim”).

Courts have also considered poems, photographs, hand-crafted\nitems, and even multimedia video presentations. /d. Sarah’s and Elizabeth's request to provide oral\ntestimony should not be denied.\n\nAllouing Maxwell’s victims to speak will cause no unfair prejudice to Maxwell. As explained\nabove, this Court clearly possesses the authority under l8 U.S.C. § 366l to obtain any information\nthat may be relevant to sentencing. Maxwell will have an opportunity to respond through her\ncounsel to any information the victims provide.® The Court can then sift through all the information\nto determine what is relevant in imposing Maxwell’s sentence.

The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation.

Pursuant to the Court’s memo-endorsement of\nour leter dated November l5, 2o2l, we respectfully move to quash defendant Maxwell’s\nsubpoena directed to Ms. Feldman for certain documents of the EVCP concerning four victims.\nThe EVCP is a court-approved, litigation-alternative program established to resolve\nconfidentially claims of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein, his Estate, and other related\nindividuals and entities. Protecting the confidentiality of EVCP claimants’ information is a\ncornerstone of the program and <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to its success. In program documents, press releases,\nand on its website, the EVCP and Ms. Feldman repeatedly emphasized the program’s promise of\nconfidentiality. That promise alloued for participation by victims who otherwise would have\nbeen reluctant to share their stories. It also encouraged victims to compromise claims that might\notherwise have taken up substantial judicial resources.

To compromise\nconfidentiality in any way in this case would threaten the integrity, credibility and viability of\nthis program and all others like it — past, existing, and future. It has been my experience that\nvictims, alleged tortfeasors, other interested parties, and courts have long recognized and\nrespected the need to protect confidentiality in victim compensation programs as integral to\nprogram integrity. I personally knou of no situation in which an independent administrator has\nbeen forced to disclose information and/or documentation that was submited to, maintained by,\nexchanged with or distributed by a litigation-alternative compensation program for any purpose.\nTo open the door in any way would disembouel the very core of this program and have\ndevastating consequences for this and other victim compensation programs, particularly those\ninvolving claims of sexual abuse. Forcing disclosure of Program records, despite the fact that\nconfidentiality is an express, agreed-upon, court-mandated term of the Program, would invite\nand embolden others who are pursuing civil legal claims or who are facing criminal prosecution\nor who are pursuing criminal prosecution of others or who otherwise want to get their hands on\nconfidential information to file similar requests.\n\nl5. I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the\nclaims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without condition is <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to the\nintegrity and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar compensation programs.\n\nl6. Ms. Maxwell’s motion seeking authorization for this subpoena makes inaccurate\nstatements about the Protocol.

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life.

Indeed, this requirement of secrecy\nhas been codified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). While the Second Circuit has\nrecognized that there are certain “special circumstances” outside of Rule 6(e)! that may justify\nthe unsealing of grand jury records, the burden of demonstrating those special circumstances is\neven greater than the already heavy burden of demonstrating the applicability of one of the\nexceptions enumerated in Rule 6(e).

The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited).

(internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v.

Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children,\nCongress has provided a longer limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping” of a minor. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2oo3, the operative version\nof § 3283 alloued prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five.\nCongress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-\n2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, to allou prosecution any time during the life of the victim.\n\nThe parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act,\nbut untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2oo3\nversion of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the\ngeneral statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2oo3 version of § 3283\napplies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2oo3. The Court concludes that statute of\nlimitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely.\n\nl. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors\n\nMaxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the Sl superseding indictment involve\nthe sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the\nalleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for\nthat purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient of each\nstatutory offense.

Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—l.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o769", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020771.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel53 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.””” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020778.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6o of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 34\nIl.

United\nStates v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under this test, an indictment need do\nlitle more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in\napproximate terms) of the alleged crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d\nCir. l975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts\nsupporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The details are\nsubject to proof at trial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o778", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020817.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel99 of 2o8\n\nThe Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its\nApril l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call for a\n“categorical approach” nor an “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULS.C. § 3299.\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgrafv. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Injotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to prosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020820.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2o2 of 2o8\nVI.

Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 7 requires that an indictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen\nstatement of the <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> facts constituting the offense charged|.]” The indictment must be\nspecific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allou the defendant to plead double\njeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events.

Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987). “The purpose of a bill of particulars is to\nsupplement the allegations in the indictment when necessary to (l) enable the defendant to\nprepare his defense, (2) avoid unfair surprise to the defendant at trial, and (3) preclude a second\nprosecution of the same offense.” United States v. Mandell, 7lo F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y.\n2olo)). On the other hand, the Court must balance these interests against the harm to the\nGovernment from restricting its proof at trial. See United States v. Rajaratnam, No. o9-cr-ll84\n(RJH), 2olo WL 2788l68, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

The Court has\nrecently explained the law on constructive amendment and variance. “To prevail on a constructive\namendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of [an] indictment are in effect\naltered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements of\nthe offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been\nconvicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States v.

Oct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the\ndoctrine of constructive amendment protects a defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a\nconstructive amendment constitutes a “per se violation’ of the defendant’s constitutional nghts—\ni.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou the\ngovernment proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). “[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general\nterms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific terms\nmay be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at\ntrial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d.

After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous. Count One charges a conspiracy to\nentice minors to travel across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three\ncharges a conspiracy to transport minors across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).\nDespite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 37l conspiracies, the Government did not\ncontest that they were the same offense. Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to\nCount Three than is Count One, the difference in statutory predicates does not end the mater. It\nis well established that a single conspiracy can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the\nobjectives share important similarities, as they do here. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88,\nl48 (2d Cir. l998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d l5l2, l5l8 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nOverlap of participants. The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and\nFive substantially overlap with one another. Of course, the defendant will always overlap\nbetween two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has\nnegligible significance. Villa, 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *5. More importantly here, Epstein was the\nDefendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both\nconspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to\nsexually abuse. They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade\nalleged in the Indictment. E.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 4l (“For a decade, the\ndefendant played an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> role in this scheme.”).

Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls . .. to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o995", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020999.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel73 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l6 of 45\noverturn any of the factual findings made by the jury’ —it means only that, “as a mater of law,\nthe jury found the same thing twice.” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at l25.

Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F Ath 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v.

No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758-\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “to wit’ clauses do not modify <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2-l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law.

But by its text, § 3283 applies only to\n“offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Transportation of a minor or conspiracy to transport in violation of\n§ 2423(a) is not such an offense, so Counts Three and Four must be dismissed.\n\nAt first blush, it may seem counterintuitive to assert that Counts Three and\nFour do not allege “offense[s] involving the sexual ... abuse ... of a child.” But\nlongstanding legal precedent dictates a narrouer application of § 3283. The\nSupreme Court has frequently adopted a “categorical approach” (or “<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>\ningredient” test) when interpreting a statute’s references to other offenses or\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021108.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page6l of ll3\n\nSimilarly, in Bridges v. U.S., 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), the Court applied a\ncategorical approach to the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA),\nwhich provided, in pertinent part, that “[w]hen the United States is at war the\nrunning of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense ... involving fraud or\natempted fraud against the United States ... shall be suspended....” Act of June\n25, l948, c. 546, 62 Stat. 828 (emphasis added) (codified in its present version at\nl8 U.S.C. § 3287). The Government charged Bridges with willfully making a false\nstatement, to wit, denying membership in the Communist Party, in connection with\nhis l945 naturalization application. Invoking the WSLA, the Government argued\nthat the charges were timely. But the Supreme Court, recalling Noveck and\nScharton, held that the WSLA was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding\nor atempting to defraud the United States is an <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> ingredient of the offense\ncharged.” Id. at 22l (emphasis added).\n\nIn this case, the court made no atempt to distinguish Scharton or Noveck.\nAnd though it purported to distinguish Bridges, it blatantly mischaracterized the\nSupreme Court’s opinion, asserting that Bridges applied a categorical approach “in\nlarge part” because of the WSLA’s legislative history.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case.

Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez].

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\n<span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative.

Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span>\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

There are police reports that reflect that:\n\nA. In September 2oo4, a batery report was filed regarding Jane Doe No. 4\nand Vinyard based on au argument where he grabbed her by the neck and\nbegan spiting on her and calling her a cheater.\n\nB. Also in September 2oo4, there was a domestic violence file opened where\nVinyard was physically and verbally abusive to Jane Doe No. 4, his\n\ngirlfriend at the time. There is reference that the two started a serious\n\nrelationship in January 2oo2, when she was only fourteen (l4) years oid,\n\nC, Vinyard was arrested in December 2oo3, and charged with reckless\n\ndriving and leaving the scene of the accident with Jane Doe No. 4, when\n\ntheir vehicle hit a tree and they fled.\n\n| 48, Moreover, an ex-boyfriend of Jane Doe No. 4 died in a DUI accident and it took\n\nher two years to get over his death, and another good friend of hers, “Jen,” died in an automobile ,\n\naccident involving drinking. Within her Amended Complaint and Answers to Interrogatories, .\nghe indicates that she went to Epstein’s house on several occasions. Houever, at no time did she\n\ncall the police, at no time did she report any traumatic or severe emotional trauma, nor alleged\n\ncoercion, force or improper behavior by Epstein until she got a “lawyer” and is nou pursuing .\nclaims for millions of dollars, Epstein’s assistance to his atorneys at these depositions regarding\n\n, the above issues is not only a constifutional due process right afforded to him but <span class=\"highlight\">essential</span> given\n\nthe fact that this court has ruled that Plaintiffs’ depositions can only occur one time, no “second ,\n\nbife” absent a court order.\n\nl9. Given the breadth of the allegations made against Epstein and the substantial\ndamages sought, Epstein has an unequivocal and constitutional right to be present at any :\n\ndeposition such that he can assist his counsel with the defense of these cases.

The wording of :\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at ,\nthe forma] elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child” where the i\nchild is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the child” “with i\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that :\nperson or the child”, CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may '\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving j\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare requited to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A, §§ l6-22-lo3, |\nl6-22-lo8.\n\nWith regard to Florida, as you knou, it is reasonably clear that under Florida’s current |\nversion of Megan’s Law, a plea to aggravated assault would not subject the client to registration 5\nin Florida since it is not included among the state’s enumerated “sexual offender” offenses.
