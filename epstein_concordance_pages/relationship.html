Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll).

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior.

She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000997.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGvsnt DOM 2o FilecoOAI3o2 aPage aB26lol9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed.

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing.

In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl Filed o6/29/2o Page 2 of l8\n.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l3 of l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference.

So\nit didn't surprise me that in her prep school classes, as well as her bachelor's and master's work at\nOxford, where she'd folloued her elder siblings, Ghislaine produced exemplary grades and a reputation\nas a serious student.

We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review.

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes).

To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

This\n\n4 testimony is, in any case, far afield from the sex trafficking\n5 and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute\n\n6 in Giuffre v. Maxwell. Although the prurient interest of some\n7 may be left unsatiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in\n\n8 keeping private the details of her sexual relationships with\n\n9 consenting adults warrants the sealing of those portions of her\nlo testimony (and any materials that reference them).\n\nll For the sake of efficiency, my chambers will share\n\nl2 with the parties a copy of the transcript that highlights the\nl3 portions of Ms. Maxwell's deposition that should remain\n\nl4 redacted.

The Court finds, as it did for\n2o the last round of motions it considered for unsealing, that\n2l Ms. Giuffre's privacy interests in her medical records, where\n22 they reference the medical treatment she received, outweigh any\n23 public interests in those materials.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms.\n\nMaxwell.\n\nThere can be no legitimate dispute that the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are\ninflammatory and unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.

Indictment {ff 7c, lld, l7d. The\nphrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even though the alleged conduct may well have\nbeen lawful: Accuser-3 was at or above the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times,\nand the indictment contains no suggestion that the alleged sexual activity involving Accuser-3\nwas nonconsensual. Regardless of whether the conduct was lawful or unlawful in England,\nhouever, few allegations could be more prejudicial to a defendant than allegations that she\nparticipated in the “sexual abuse” of a teenager. The allegations as to Accuser-3, though\nirrelevant to the government’s conspiracy counts, thus create precisely the prejudicial appearance\nthe government seeks.\n\nBecause the allegations as to Accuser-3 are both irrelevant to the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell and unduly prejudicial, they should be stricken as surplusage.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million.

See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees.

With respect to the “co-conspirator” provision, the OPR Report\nconcluded, in relevant part:\n\nOther than various drafts of the NPA and of a federal plea\nagreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous records\nmentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects\ndiscussed or debated it—or even gave it much consideration. Drafts\nof the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou that the final\nbroad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein” evolved from a more narrou provision\nsought by the defense. The provision expanded as [USAO-SDFL\nprosecutor Maria] Villafafia and defense counsel exchanged drafts\nof, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the NPA,\nwith apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within\nthe USAO about the Provision.\nOPR Report at l66. With respect to Maxwell in particular, OPR interviewed Maria Villafafia, the\nlead prosecutor on the case, and noted:\nVillafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s\nlongtime <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with a close female friend who was a well-\nknoun socialite, but, according to Villafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t\nhave any specific evidence against her.” Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would\nbenefit from the provision were the four female assistants identified\nby name.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 239\njury.”). At this stage, the defendant must identify defects so fundamental that the charged\nstatements cannot, as a mater of law, support a perjury conviction. She has failed to do so, and\nher motion should be denied.\n\nl. April 2ol6 Deposition\n\nAt the April 2ol6 deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant about hou Giuffre\ncame to Epstein’s home (Ex. lo at l4:9-l7:4), whether hired massage therapists engaged in sexual\nactivity with Epstein (id. at 5l:l3-55:l6), and the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s Florida\ncriminal case (id. at l7l:25-l73:l2, l83:25-l86:2l), among other topics. The transcript makes\nclear that when the defendant did not understand a question, she said so. (See, e.g., id. at 9:4-9\n(“[C]an you please clarify the question. I don’t understand what you mean by female, I don’t\nunderstand what you mean by recruit.”), 39:23-24 (“I don’t understand what your question is\nasking.”’), 94:l8-95:4 (“You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap\nme, I will not be trapped.’’), l38:6 (“Define <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.”), 244:22-23 (“You are not asking me a\ngood question, sorry.’’).\n\nCount Five charges the defendant with perjury arising from two colloquies at this\ndeposition. First, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions about whether the\ndefendant brought women to Epstein, which the defendant resisted by observing that she hired\n“people across the board” to “work for Jeffrey.” (Ud. at 245:7-l8). Guiuffre’s counsel asked\nwhether any minors worked as exercise instructors or masseuses at Epstein’s home, and the\ndefendant testified that they were all adults except for Giuffre, who she acknouledged at least\nclaimed to have been seventeen. (/d. at 246:l8-25l:l2). Giuffre’s counsel then asked questions\nabout whether Epstein had a “sexual preference for underage minors,” which drew objections from\n\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003093.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 239\nA.

That is my testimony, that is correct.\n\nThe defendant primarily argues that her answers were literally true. In the defendant’s\ntelling, the phrase “[w]hen I was with him,” refers not to the duration of the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein, but instead to only those moments when she was in the act of having sex\nwith Epstein and either the blond or brunete identified above. (Def. Mot. 4 at l6). Ps\nshe further argues, because the question asked the defendant about the l99os and 2ooos, it\ntherefore covered any “‘sexual activities’ spanning more than a millennium.” (/d. at l6-l7).\n\nl32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003094.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 239\nThe defendant, therefore, argues that the questioner asked whether a logically impossible\nevent occurred or will occur at some point over the course of a millennium. But the defendant’s\nprofessed confusion—which again was not raised during the deposition itself—ignores the plain\nand obvious context of the question, which did not refer to a time period far exceeding the human\nlife span, and was not limited to only the times in which the defendant was in the act of having sex\nwith Epstein. Plainly, a jury could find that the defendant correctly understood the question when\nshe answered it in July 2ol6, and that she ascribed a natural meaning to the words used in the\nquestions, and not the tortured illogical meaning she nou assigns to those questions: whether,\nduring the course of her <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein, she was aware of anyone other than herself\nhaving sexual relations with Epstein. The Government expects its evidence to shou that she was.\nSee, e.g., Indictment § l (stating that the defendant “assisted, facilitated, and contributed to”\nEpstein’s sexual abuse of minors). At a minimum, the defendant’s answers were not “literally true\nunder any conceivable interpretation of the questions.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. And the\ndefendant’s professed confusion nou and proposed illogical reading of the questions in the instant\nmotion does not render them fundamentally ambiguous. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“A\ndefense to a charge of perjury may not be established by isolating a statement from context, giving\nit in this manner a meaning entirely different from that which it has when the testimony is\nconsidered as a whole.”). Accordingly, a jury should be permited to determine what meaning the\ndefendant ascribed to those questions and whether her answers were in fact false.\nFinally, the defendant answered the follouing questions:\n\nQ. Did you ever give a massage to anyone other than Mr. Epstein at\n\nany of Mr. Epstein's properties?\n\nA. First of all, I never said I gave Mr. Epstein a massage.\n\nl33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003121.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 239\nMurgio, 2o9 F.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.''

And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.”” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC.

The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 348\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !“°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.'?

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY — JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'® Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability.

Epstein also forced Jane Doe #3 to have sex with\nBrunel on numerous occasions, at places including Epstein’s mansion in West Palm Beach, Litle\nSt. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (many including orgies that were comprised of other\nunderage girls), New York City, New Mexico, Paris, the south of France, and California.\n\nEpstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other pouerful men,\nincluding numerous prominent American politicians, pouerful business executives, foreign\npresidents, a well-knoun Prime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3\nto describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them.\n\nThe Government was well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it\nlisted her as a victim in the atachment to the NPA.

This testimony is, in any case, far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to\nthe dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell. Although the prurient interest of some may\nbe left unsatiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in keeping private the\ndetails of her sexual relationships with consenting adults warrants the sealing\nof those portions of her testimony (and any materials that reference them).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3847\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l7 Filed o4/l9/2l Page3of6\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril l, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nThe testimony at issue is undeniably private: it relates exclusively to Ms. Maxwell’s\nconsensual adult sexual activities involving “‘sex toys or devices used in sexual activities” and\na “three-way sexual” encounter involving an adult “blond and brunete.” See Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558, 567 (U.S. 2oo3) (“It suffices for us to acknouledge that adults may\nchoose to enter upon [a] <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> in the confines of their homes and their oun private lives\nand still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate\nconduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is\nmore enduring.”); see also Griswold v. Connecticut, 38l U.S. 479, 485-86 (U.S. l965). And\nMs. Maxwell proposes only those redactions “narrouly tailored” to preserve her privacy\ninterest in her intimate, consensual adult sexual activities. Press-Enterprise IT, lo6 S.Ct. at\n2743. Rather than seek to redact either the argument or the surrounding testimony, Ms.\nMaxwell marked for redaction those limited portions of the deposition transcript that Judge\nPreska ordered sealed. The remaining unredacted portions generally describe the redacted\ntestimony such that the public and media will have no issue ascertaining the nature of the\nlegal issues nor fulfill their role in monitoring the Courts. Inclusion of the exact lines\nreferencing “three-way sexual activity” or “sex toys” does not add to the argument but\nredacting those lines does preserve Ms. Maxwell’s privacy in testimony that was both\ncompelled and obtained under highly improper methods.\n\nIn addition to her privacy interests, Ms. Maxwell seeks to preserve her right to a fair\ntrial free from unfair pretrial publicity concerning what may ultimately be deemed\n“inadmissible” evidence at the criminal trial. United States v. Doe, 63 F.3d l2l, l28 (2d Cir.\nl995) (“compelling interests” that counterbalance any presumption of access include the\n“privacy interests of the defendant” and the fair trial rights of the defendant).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page6ofl7\n\nA. The Counts are Dissimilar and Illogically and Artificially Connected.\n\nThe government claims that the Perjury Counts are properly joined because they are\n“logically connected” to the Mann Act Counts and part of the same “common plan or scheme.”\nResp. at l38, l4l, l43. No logic can be gleaned from the government’s response. Offenses are\nor “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of related\ntransactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996).\n\nHere, the Perjury Counts did not “grou out of” the conduct underlying the Mann Act\nCounts. Ms. Maxwell’s depositions occurred in 2ol6, twenty years after the conduct alleged in\nthe Mann Act Counts purportedly occurred from l994-l997. Furthermore, the allegations\nunderlying the two sets of counts are unrelated. The “scheme” alleged in the Indictment is the\nalleged enticement of three females to travel for the purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts\nbetween l994 and l997. The depositions at the heart of the Perjury Counts concerned the truth or\nfalsity of Virginia Giuffre’s “obvious lies” about being sexually trafficked to famous people and\nher purported four years as a sex slave. None of the Accusers in the Indictment claim to have\nbeen sexually trafficked by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell to anyone, let alone any famous people.\n\nAnd the defamation case had nothing to do with any allegations by Ms. Giuffre of being enticed\nto travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Hou Ms. Maxwell’s answers to questions in 2ol6 about\nthe falsity of Ms. Giuffre’s sex trafficking claims (years after the allegations in the Indictment)\nare related to the conspiracies alleged in the Indictment is therefore a mystery.!\n\n' There is also no evidence that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein conspired or agreed to lie in the\ndefamation case. After Ms. Maxwell compelled Epstein to sit for a deposition in the defamation action, he\nasserted his right against self-incrimination and declined to answer any questions. Ms. Maxwell, having\ncommited no crime and not being a part of any conspiracy with Epstein, chose to answer questions\ntruthfully. No charges were pending against either Epstein or Ms. Maxwell at the time of the depositions\nand there was no <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between the two individuals.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page lo of lo\nPage lo\nas scheduled, and has already planned to be available to testify at trial as scheduled this summer,\ndespite her personal and professional obligations.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC.

For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll7 of 349\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !*\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order.

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®” Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files.

USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°?

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l78 of 349\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8l of 349\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.””°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “chung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 228 of 349\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 279 of 349\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability.

Indeed,\nnothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same offenses\nthat were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be covered by the\nplea agreement.\n\nMoreover, the cases in which the Second Circuit has applied Annabi provide no support to\nthe defendant’s theory.

The defendant’s motion does not offer a mode\nof analysis for this nuanced issue, but in any event the Court need not resolve the question of\nwhether the charges in the NPA are indeed the “exact same,” because the NPA does not apply at\nall in this District.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4 of 8o\ninvolved with, the university.

The court concluded that Tyson’s rationale was applicable to the\ninstant case. The court rejected Cosby’s efforts to distinguish Constand’s allegations\nfrom those dating to the l98os. Cosby emphasized the fact that the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between\nCosby and Constand lasted longer than his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with any of the prior bad acts\nwitnesses, that Constand was a guest at Cosby’s home on multiple occasions, that Cosby\nand Constand had exchanged gifts, that Cosby had made prior sexual advances touard\nConstand, that the nature of the sexual contact differed among the alleged victims, and\nthat the alleged prior assaults occurred in hotel rooms or at the home of a third party,\nwhile the incident with Constand occurred in Cosby’s home. /d. at 4ol-o2. The Superior\nCourt dismissed these apparent dissimilarities as unimportant, opining that “ijt is\nimpossible for two incidents of sexual assault involving different victims to be identical in\nallrespects.” /d. at 4o2.

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. Houever, while “we accord\ndeference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is\nde novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omited).

From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between him and Cosby was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b). Presented with such a request, the petitioned court “shall issue\nsuch an order,” id., upon which a witness “may not refuse to testify based on his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.” /d. § 5947(c). At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide Cosby with transactional immunity. He\nexplained that this conferral was predicated upon the state’s common-law authority as a\nsovereign rather than any statutory provisions or protocols. T.C.O. at 5/7 (citing N.T.,\n2/2/2ol6, at 232, 234, 236). The record does not contradict his testimony. There is no\nevidence, nor any real contention, that the parties even contemplated a grant of immunity\nunder Section 5947. The trial court’s finding that the interaction between D.A. Castor and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4862\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7l of 8o\n\nTo hold otherwise would recast our understanding of reasonableness into\nsomething unrecognizable and unsustainable under our law. If Cosby’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the Commonwealth,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is necessary in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice Black.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about Cosby’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement of the Commonwealth’s charging decision.\n\nThe trial court alternatively suggested that Cosby’s belief that he would never be\nprosecuted, thus stripping him of his Fifth Amendment rights, based upon litle more than\na press release, was unreasonable because neither Cosby nor his atorneys demanded\nthat the terms of any offers or assurances by D.A. Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance. We decline to construe as unreasonable\nthe failure to do that which the law does not require.\n\nIt also has been suggested that the level of the defendant’s sophistication is a\nrelevant factor in assessing whether his reliance upon a prosecutor’s decision was\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page8oflo\ntopic, communications about Ms. Maxwell, and ms’ The\ncommunications are relevant, authentic, and an appropriate evidentiary foundation can be\nestablished under many rules of evidence including F.R.E. 8o3(6).

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v. Merrell Dou Phar., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo563l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 24\nelement of the crime charged or of a defense” because those “maters are for the trier of fact\nalone.” Fed R. Evid. 7o4(b).\n\nRule 4o3 demands exclusion when the probative value of evidence is substantially\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nAnd Rule 4o4 prohibits any witness, witness or lay, from offering evidence “of a person’s\ncharacter or character trait . . . to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in\naccordance with the character or trait.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(a)(l).\n\nApplying these provisions, and as elaborated belou, each of Rocchio’s opinions is\ninadmissible.\n\nA. Opinion l: Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern of\nbehaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature\nof the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser.\n\nl. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are unreliable.\n\nRocchio’s first and most prominent proposed area of testimony concerms “grooming,”\nwhich she characterizes as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to\nbuild trust and atachment with their abuser.” Ex. l, p 2. Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5634\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page l2 of 24\nSept. 22, 2olo) (finding expert’s opinion unreliable because the expert testified “that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem’). Rocchio’s testimony thus runs the significant “risk of being the ipse dixit of the expert\nagainst which the Supreme Court has warned.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3 (citing Gen.\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. l36, l46 (l999)). And because of her “inability to cite an error rate\nfor false positives,” her “testimony [is] virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-\nexamination.” /d. at *2 (citing United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42, l46-47 (D. Me.\n2olo) (excluding testimony about grooming in prosecution for transporting a minor across state\nlines with the intent of engaging in illegal sexual activity)).\n\nBut even if Rocchio’s personal opinion about the veracity of her patients were sufficient\nto render her testimony reliable, her patients are a self-selected group of individuals. Rocchio has\nnot and cannot point to a single study, controlled or otherwise, establishing the\nrepresentativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming behavior. Ex. l;\nE.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., Civ. No. o7-8383(LAP), 2olo WL 346637o, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.\n3l, 2olo) (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure that the\nmaterials he reviewed were representative”). Again, Rocchio’s opinions “cannot be challenged\nor tested in any meaningful way.” See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.\n\nThere are other problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony. She opines, for example,\nthat “[iJndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse,” Ex. l, p.2, but she doesn’t explain hou often. Half the time? Two-\nthirds of the time? Nor does she explain hou “frequently” the “sexual abuse of minors . . . occurs\nthrough the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of an established <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is\ndeveloped over time.” /d. Rocchio’s generic conclusions that grooming “often” happens or\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 24\nintent or the truthfulness of the victim’s testimony—does not satisfy the fit or reliability\nrequirements” of Rule 7o2); Bennet & O’ Donohue, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse at 974 (“[I]t\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings as it does not\nmeet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard.”).\n\n4. Roccio’s grooming opinions are substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is also inadmissible under Rule 4o3. For one thing, it will\n“radically simplify” an otherwise complex case. See United States v. Burns, No. o7 CR 556,\n2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2oo9) (criticizing the “grooming theory” in in the\ncontext of a sentencing guidelines calculation). As the Court explained in United States v. Burns,\nRocchio’s “grooming theory” can “foist a damning teleology on a series of actions each of which\nmight have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all. . . radically simplifyi[ng] the\nmess of .. . competing feelings, urges, and needs over the course of [a] <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> into the neat\ndichotomy of victim and predator.” Jd. See Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (to describe the\nso-called “atributes of a sexual predator” is to “invite the jury to so label a defendant” a sexual\npredator).\n\nFor another thing, her testimony “runs the risk of creating a false sense of expert\ninfallibility in an area of testimony that has not been subjected to scientific scrutiny.” Gonyer,\n2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (citing Raymond, 7oo F.Supp.2d at l5o (“a toxic mixture of purported\nexpertise and common sense”)). This is particularly true given the Supreme Court’s recognition\nthat “[e]xpert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in\nevaluating it.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nWere there any doubt about the reliability or relevance of Rocchio’s grooming opinions,\nwhich there isn’t, the Court should still exclude her testimony under Rule 4o3.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo564o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005641.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 24\nB. Opinion 2: The <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed disclosure. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a treatment\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo564l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005651.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-l Filed lo/29/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology.

A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse.

The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 84\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (citing Fed.

See, e.g., United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o Cr. 6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l). In\nthis context, the testimony must “concern maters that the average juror is not capable of\nunderstanding on his or her oun.” United States v.

Sup. 3d 365, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“Weighing whether the\nexpert testimony assists the trier of fact goes primarily to relevance.”).\n\nCourts have frequently admited expert testimony on the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nbetween perpetrators and victims of sex crimes. For instance, in United States v. Kidd, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 259 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), the Government gave notice of expert testimony on “the\npsychology of the pimp-prostitute <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>,” including concepts such as “trauma bonding.” Jd.\nat 263.

Discussion\nThe defendant does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Nor could she: Dr.\nRocchio is a leader in her field, teaching others as a professor at Broun University, and she has\napproximately twenty-five years of clinical experience. She is testifying in general about core\nconcepts in her field, based on her “extensive study of the relevant data and literature and her\nclinical experience treating hundreds of trauma and abuse patients over the past twenty years.”\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 84\nUnited States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG), 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22,\n2ol9).\n\nInstead, the defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are unreliable, irrelevant, or\nprejudicial. To the contrary, and as explained in greater detail belou, each of the Dr. Rocchio’s\nfive challenged opinions is well supported and would aid the jury in understanding the evidence\nat trial. The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5794\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005797.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel4 of 84\nsome sort of empirical scientific testing,” and that “those arguments go to the weight, not the\nadmissibility, of her proposed testimony”).\n\nAs noted above, courts have frequently admited testimony about the psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between victims of sexual abuse and their perpetrators. See supra pp. 7-8. Courts\nhave also specifically authorized expert testimony on the subject of grooming. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86, lo97-lo98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (holding that admission of expert\ntestimony on grooming did not violate Federal Rules of Evidence 7o2 or 4o3 nor violate due\nprocess and finding that the expert “‘merely gave a straightforward account of relevant background\ninformation based on [the expert’s] oun knouledge and experience’” (quoting United States v.\nJohnson, 86o F.3d ll33, ll4l (8th Cir. 2ol7)); United States v. Halamek, 5 F 4th lo8l, lo87-89\n(9th Cir. 2o2l) (holding that expert testimony on grooming was “relevant, reliable, and properly\nadmited”); United States v. Isabella, 9l8 F.3d 8l6, 833 n.l5 (loth Cir. 2ol9) (“Grooming can be\nestablished by use of an expert witness who testifies about psychological tactics that are common\nin cases of child sex abuse.”); United States v. Hit, 473 F.3d l46, l58 (Sth Cir. 2oo6) (affirming\nexpert testimony on the “grooming process”); Morris v. State, 36l S.W.3d 649, 656-69 (Tx. Ct.\nCrim. App. 2oll) (collecting cases shouing that “grooming evidence has been received by courts\nfrom numerous types of experts”); see also United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir.\n2oo6), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Cabrera, l3 F.4th l4o (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(noting that evidence of grooming supported the jury’s verdict).\n\nAgainst this weight of authority, the defendant relies principally on one case from the\nDistrict of Maine. United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo). The proposed\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 84\nevidence, to evaluate what weight to give it. But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to reliability so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual assault, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. (dd.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 84\n(emphasis added)). Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant literature, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work. By virtue of her\nexperience treating victims, Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’ actions. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88 (“Extensive experience interviewing victims can qualify a person to\ntestify about the relationships those victims tend to have with their abusers.”). Dr. Rocchio will\ntestify squarely within her expertise and experience.?\n\nb. Relevance and Rule 4o3\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence at trial.\nThis case concerns an “unusual area of human interaction.” See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 39:8-9, United\nStates v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335. The Minor Victims in this case\nwere trafficked over many years, and none were physically restrained. An average juror, with no\nexperience with sexual abuse victims, may not understand why the Minor Victims continued to\n3 In United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG), 2ol9 WL 22l2639 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9),\nJudge Garaufis questioned whether an expert on grooming with experience focused on victims\nmay have been able to testify reliably about hou “perpetrators often use ‘grooming’ techniques on\nadult and child victims... .” Jd. at *7. Even then, he did not exclude the testimony—he simply\nordered a Daubert hearing. Jd. at *8. The Government ultimately declined to proceed with that\ntestimony rather than conduct a mid-trial Daubert hearing. Here, and as noted above, Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony concerns the experience of manipulated and coerced victims, rather\nthan the intentions of perpetrators.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 84\nreturn to Epstein’s home for sexual abuse, or why some occasionally expressed affection for the\ndefendant and Epstein.\n\nAlthough Dr. Rocchio will not testify about these specific Minor Victims, her testimony\nwill help the jurors understand the “psychological dynamic often seen in abusive relationships that\nleads an abuse victim to behave in counterintuitive ways, such as by declining to take opportunities\nto leave an abusive situation or by expressing gratitude to an abuser.” Torres, 2o2l WL l9475o3,\nat *7. This psychological dynamic between a victim of child sexual abuse and her abusers is\n“beyond the knouledge of the average juror and would or could plainly be helpful in understanding\nthe psychological dynamics at play.” Oct. l7, 2ol9 Tr. at 27:3-7, United States v. Dupigny, No.\nl8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98; cf’ See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 38:l3-2o, United States\nv. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt.

Jurors are not apt to intuitively\nunderstand the mechanisms that may lead a woman who is not physically restrained or confined\nto heed the demands of a pimp to traffic herself.”). Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def. Mot. at lo).\n* Relying again on Raymond, the District of Maine case, the defendant argues that expert testimony\nabout “general principles is helpful only when it ‘describes widely recognized and highly\npredictable and verifiable phenomena.’” (Def. Mot. lo (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o\nn.l2 (alterations omited)). That proposition comes from footnote l2 of Raymond, which\natempted to distinguish that expert’s “profile” testimony from the Federal Rules Advisory\nCommitee’s observation that the 2ooo amendment “does not alter the venerable practice of using\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 84\n\nThat is precisely hou Rule 7o2 works in cases where experts testify about general principles, which\nthe Rule contemplates. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee note (“[I]t might also be\nimportant in some cases for an expert to educate the factfinder about general principles, without\never atempting to apply these principles to the specific facts of the case.”). Dr. Rocchio will\nprovide reliable opinions about principles of coercion and atachment in abusive relationships that\nwill help the jury understand the psychological factors underlying the relationships that the jury\nwill learn about at trial.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the Court should preclude Dr. Rocchio’s testimony under\nRule 4o3. In so arguing, she expresses concern that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will “‘radically\nsimplify’ an otherwise complex case” by “‘foist[ing] a damning teleology on a series of actions\neach of which might have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all.’” (Def. Mot. at\nll (quoting United States v. Burns, No. o7 Cr. 556, 2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27,\n2oo9)).° There is nothing prejudicial or simple about Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. The jury will not\nconclude that the defendant is guilty because Dr. Rocchio explains that acts which “might have\nbeen motivated by a variety of ends” are sometimes part of the process of sexual abuse. Whether\nexpert testimony to educate the factfinder on general principles.” Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at\nl5o n.l2 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee note). The defendant cites no place\ncontaining this limitation in the text of the Rule, its advisory commitee notes, Daubert, or the law\nof this Circuit or District. Nor does it make sense on its oun terms: “hou financial markets respond\nto corporate reports” or the “principles of thermodynamics” are sometimes highly predictable, but\nnot always, depending on the context.\n> Burns, a case about a district court’s application at sentencing of a Guidelines enhancement, says\nnothing about whether the jury would be confused by learning about grooming.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of 84\nthey were in this case will depend on the other evidence. That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the <span class=\"highlight\">Relationship</span> Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\ndisclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, victims may not recognize that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 84\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 3l:l-34:l2, United States v. Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (explaining that, where there is a “reliable basis for\n.. . testi[mony] about trauma bonding and coercive control as phenomena that exist more broadly,”\nthe expert may testify, and defendants “are at liberty to vigorously cross-examine [the expert] to\natempt to cabin or limit trauma bonding and coercive control to populations predominately outside\nof the alleged victims in this case”).

(October ll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A at l). During that time, Employee-l\nreported directly to another employee (“Employee-2”), who worked for Epstein during the\ntimeframe of the charged conspiracy, and who is referenced in the Second Superseding Indictment\n(the Indictment”). (ECF No. l87, §§ 6, 7(b)). The Government expects that Employee-l will\ntestify about Employee-l’s observations of the close <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between the defendant and\nEpstein. Indeed, Employee-l will testify that Employee-l worked out of the defendant’s\ntounhouse in Manhatan during the weeks that Employee-l worked in New York City. The\nGovernment also expects Employee-l to testify about her observations at Epstein’s properties,\nincluding observations of minor girls at the properties, as well as her knouledge of Epstein’s\npractice to arrange multiple sexualized massages per day. In addition, although Employee-l’s\nemployment post-dates the defendant’s conduct with the victims in this case, Employee-l became\nfamiliar with certain items in Epstein’s residences during her tenure there, and thus Employee-l\nwill authenticate certain exhibits relating to the Minor Victims. Finally, the Government expects\nee\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5822\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 84\nEmployee-l to testify that in or about October 2oo5, Epstein and her supervisor directed her to\ngather the computers and contact books in the house and hand them over to a specified individual.\n\nEmployee-l’s testimony is admissible for multiple permissible purposes. Her testimony\nshous the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. Moreover, this evidence is admissible in the alternative under\nRule 4o4(b), for substantially the same reasons.\n\n2. The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions. The\ndefense nou also has this briefing, five weeks before trial. Thus, any alleged gap in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5823\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 48 of 84\nMaxwell’s state of mind.” (Op. & Order at 26-27, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“Courts in this district generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the presentation of the Government’s evidence at\ntrial, because that evidence may affect hou specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’’)).\nHaving concluded that it should delay striking these overt acts until after presentation of the\nGovernment’s evidence, the Court should not nou effectively reverse its decision by precluding\nthat very evidence. If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996.

This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein. Moreover,\nher <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three.

(Def. Mot. l3 at\n2-3). Government Exhibit 294 displays a box containing “Twin Torpedos”—sex toys—seized\nduring the search of Epstein’s Palm Beach house. This photograph is corroborative of witness\ntestimony, which is expected to describe the presence of sex toys and that the defendant and\nEpstein used sex toys during their abuse.\n\nFifth, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 3l3 is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2-\n3). Government Exhibit 3l3 is a photograph of the defendant and Epstein swimming together\nwhile nude. This evidence corroborates witness testimony expected at trial, which will describe\ntopless swimming in the pool at Epstein’s Palm Beach House. It is also relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nbetween the defendant and Epstein. For instance, to the extent the defense at trial argues that the\ndefendant was merely an employee of Epstein’s, this photograph is evidence to the contrary.\n\nSixth, the defense argues that Government Exhibit 6o6 lacks evidentiary foundation, is\nhearsay, and is irrelevant because it was created after the events alleged in the Indictment. (Def.\nMot. l3 at 2-3). Government Exhibit 6o6 is a manual governing the operations of the Palm Beach\nhouse. A witness at trial is expected to authenticate this document and explain that it was the\nversion in effect at the house in 2oo5. Another witness is expected to testify about the rules in\neffect in the Palm Beach household during the time period of the charged conduct; those rules are\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5859\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same. These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 8 of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5877\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne difference has been found between genders of the victim in this\nemotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale child doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\nchild about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them. Physical\n\nisolation, closeness, contact are more important than verbal seduction.\n\n(p. 297)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N.

She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l4 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 969\n\nl. Minimize false negatives. Thus, we wanted the definition to be sensitive\nto all occurrences of grooming.\n\n2. Minimize false positives. Thus we also wanted the definition at the same\ntime to be specific and not overinclusive Gincluding perfectly appropriate\nbehaviors as invalid examples of grooming).\n\n3. Be capable of providing the basis for a valid assessment procedure.\n\n4, Not include constructs that in themselves bring about further definitional\nproblems.\n\n5. Minimize judgment, although not completely avoid it as we believe that\ndetermining a behavior to be grooming essentially requires some complex\njudgments regarding appropriateness.\n\n6. Shou interrater reliability (have a high degree of agreement across raters).\n\n7. Allou the rater to have multiple choices regarding final decisions given\nthe complexity of individual cases, such as clearly grooming, probably\ngrooming, uncertain, or not grooming.\n\n8. Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N.

Favoritism directed touard the child (e.g., the child is treated much beter\nthan siblings or classmates, particularly when this is intimate or isolating).\n9. Boundary violations such as inappropriately bathing the child, clothing the\nchild, sleeping with the child, the adult being in underwear around the\nchild, the adult acting like a child, or the adult sharing private information\nwith the child, particularly sexual or <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> information (e.g., “my\nwife and I are not having sex”). Again, for parents, family members or\ncaregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation\nthan for others.\nlo. Asking the child to keep secrets, particularly about their contact (e.g.,\nthe mother’s Christmas present would not be regarded as a problematic\nsecret, whereas asking the child to not tell that she was with the offender\nwould be).\nll.

Repeated violations of the child’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it\nmay be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming\nbehaviors that may be misinterpreted:\nl. Purchasing appropriate gifts for the child (e.g., for birthdays).\n2. Engaging in appropriate hand-holding (e.g., to cross the street).\n3.

A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005893.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “...

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nAccording to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a\nqualified expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential\nexpert, the government is right.\n\nBut saying that Rocchio is a “qualified expert” is not enough. The government must\nidentify what Rocchio is an expert in. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2; Fed. R. Crim. l6. As Ms. Maxwell\npointed out in her motion, the government hasn’t done that. Mot. at 2.\n\nWhat’s more, even if Rocchio is a “qualified expert” in something, she is not a “qualified\nexpert” in everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the\nhuman brain or memory generally. Resp. at 3o n.7.) And as even the government admits,\nRocchio has no experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, or treating alleged perpetrators\nof sexual abuse. Resp. at l9, 23, 26. She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged\nperpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”\n\nThe government atempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience\ntreating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’\nactions.” Resp. at l9.\n\nBut hou does Rocchio knou her patients were victims of sexual abuse? Because her\npatients told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions\nare based on her treatment of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes\nare telling the truth and are therapeutic consumers in a financial <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with her.\n\nThe government has no response to this, other than to say that Rocchio and other\n“Te]linical psychologists are not so credulous.” Resp. at l6. If this were right, though, one would\nexpect the government to explain hou clinical psychologists ensure their patients are telling the\ntruth — in other words, hou clinical psychologists like Rocchio test and verify their opinions.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5978\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 52\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s opinions are thus unreliable, the government says: “If the\nvictim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference whether the\nperpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing the victim\nfor abuse by a third party.” Resp. at 26.\n\nHardly. It makes all the difference in the world because Ms. Maxwell is on trial, not Mr.\nEpstein. The logic (such as it is) of grooming evidence is that the perpetrator normalizes sexual\nbehavior to facilitate his later abuse of the victim. But because Ms. Maxwell did not abuse\nanyone, there is no basis to conclude that anything she did was “grooming.” The government\nthus intends to have Rocchio characterize innocent conduct by Ms. Maxwell as something more\nnefarious, thereby further blurring the line that experts are already unable to draw reliably. Resp.\nEx. A, p 2 (“There is a lack of consensus regarding exactly what [the grooming] process entails\nand hou it is clearly distinguished from normal adult—child interactions.”).\n\nThe government’s additional arguments fail.\n\ne <A psychologist who treats alleged victims of abuse but does not treat alleged\nperpetrators is nothing like a urologist who treats urology patients. Resp. at ll\n(citing Bosco v. United States, No. l4 CIV. 3525 (JFK), 2ol6 WL 53762o5\n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6)). Rocchio assumes her patients are telling the truth, and\nshe never hears or credits the other side of the story. The urologist, by contrast,\nhas scientific means to verify what her patients tell her, and there isn’t another\nperson whose side of the story she needs to hear.\n\ne The government repeatedly says that “courts have frequently admited testimony\nabout the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between victims of sexual abuse and their\nperpetrators.” Resp. at l3. See also id. at 7-8. But those cases do not address the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo598o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses.

The government offers no explanation, houever, for why testimony of an alleged rape\nwould prove the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> “between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when gay\nhas never claimed in her prior statements to the FBI or anywhere else that Ms. Maxwell knew of,\nfacilitated, or participated in the alleged rape in any way. Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and/or <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l2\n\nC.

The defense expert\nnotice includes four other sets of opinions that supposedly respond to Dr. Rocchio but do not\nsatisfy the Daubert standard. First, the expert notice—which closely parallels the defense’s\nDaubert motion—improperly discusses the facts of this particular case and comments on various\nlegal documents, even though it offers no basis whatsoever to conclude that Dr. Dietz has any legal\nexpertise or has reliably applied any expertise to the facts of this case. In particular, the notice\nstates that Dr. Dietz will opine that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on grooming “carries the risk of\nimputing motive and intent to the Defendant” (Ex. A at 3), that “Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of ‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,”\nand that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for herself,”\nbut instead that she “recruited and groomed minors to provide sexualized massages for Mr.\nEpstein” (id. at 4). These opinions, while potentially relevant to the Court’s consideration of a\nDaubert motion, are not properly put before a jury.\n\nSecond, certain of Dr. Dietz’s opinions about grooming are not themselves reliable or\ninvade the province of the jury. In particular, it is circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive\nand intent,” because grooming is defined to be a strategic patern of behavior used to develop\nrelationships of atachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. (Ex. A at 3). That is,\nif the behaviors lack the requisite motive and intent, they are not grooming behaviors. If Dr.\nDietz’s point is that determining motive and intent is for the factfinder (id.), the Government\nagrees—and Dr. Dietz should not be permited to testify that grooming behaviors “impute[] motive\nand intent without adequate evidence.” (/d.) The adequacy of the evidence is a question for the\njury. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will inform the jury about the existence of grooming behaviors, but\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Pagel5of 4l\nleave to the jury whether such behaviors occurred in this case. Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and subjective. (/d. at 4). But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex. A at 4). To the extent that Dr. Dietz is pointing to the fact that the term “grooming-by-\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page l6 of 4l\nproxy”—a term that Dr. Rocchio does not employ and that the defense has atempted to inject into\nthe case—is not supported by the literature, that terminological claim is of course irrelevant to any\nissue. To the extent that Dr. Dietz purports to claim that there is no authority supporting the notion\nthat a perpetrator can groom a victim for the purpose of making the victim engage in sexual\nactivities with others, this claim is patently unreliable, as Dr. Rocchio will explain at the Daubert\nhearing; there is in fact ample literature on the pimp-prostitute <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and other instances in\nwhich third parties groom an individual for the benefit of someone else. And if the Court excludes\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion on this issue, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is irrelevant.\n\nThe Government acknouledges that Dr. Dietz can offer reliable, relevant opinions in\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio. But Dr. Dietz’s proposed opinions include legal argument, opinions that\ninvade the province of the jury, and opinions that are themselves unreliable. Those should be\nexcluded.\n\n2. Opinions as to Hindsight Bias\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions that hindsight bias exists and should “temper” conclusions about\nwhether to impute knouledge to an individual (Ex. A at 5) do not convey any relevant information\nbeyond the ken of the average juror and are not helpful to the jury. Instead, they are a virtually\nunprecedented atempt to psychoanalyze the jurors and to supplant both their role as judges of the\nfacts and the Court’s role in instructing them.\n\nThe only possible relevance of hindsight bias in this case is the supposed bias of the jurors\nthemselves. This is not a case where it maters whether the opinion of a witness or a party at some\npoint suffered from hindsight bias. The primary purpose of the testimony is to convince the jurors\nto “temper” any conclusion that the defendant formed the requisite intent because the jurors might\nbe suffering from hindsight bias. (Ex. A at 5). Of course a factfinder should not confuse the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2l of 4l\n\nCompounding the improper nature of this testimony, the defense appears to seek to use Dr.\nDietz to opine as to a complex factual narrative that no reliable process of psychiatric evaluation\ncould produce. Dr. Dietz is not remotely competent to opine that Epstein would “surround himself\nwith people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that he was able to “use his brilliance to\nmanipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which\nnone had complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. Dietz has absolutely no basis\nto make such broad and sweeping factual claims about Epstein or his relationships with anyone,\nmuch less anyone in this case. It appears that Dr. Dietz has reached his conclusions based solely\non one interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in which Epstein “acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged in discovery (Def. Expert\nNotice Ex. C, atached as Exhibit B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests\nthat Epstein looked to the halos of others, not that he generated one himself. And it is no basis, at\nall, for Dr. Dietz to suggest to the jury that anyone involved in this case did anything because of\nEpstein’s “halo.”\n\nThis factual narration of Epstein’s life and apparently the lives of other people who\ninteracted with him, a defense summation based on a nullification defense masquerading as an\nexpert witness opinion, is not based on any competent evidence, and in any event is patently not\nthe product of reliable psychiatric methods reliably applied to this case. See, e.g., Island Intell.\n> This would not be the first unreliable factual claim made by Dr. Dietz, who testified in a previous\ncriminal case that a defendant got the idea of drouning her children in the bathtub from an episode\nof Law & Order in which a defendant did so and was acquited on an insanity defense, when in\nfact no such episode existed. See generally e.g., Barnete v. United States, No. l2 Civ. 327, 2o2l\nWL 949848, *9-lo (W.D.N.C. March l2, 2o2l). This led to the reversal of the trial conviction of\nthe defendant in that case. See Yates v. State, l7l S.W.3d 2l5, 222 (Tex. App. 2oo5).\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 4l\ncreates a predicate that a witness has a condition creating such a “pathway.” And even then, as\ndescribed above, it is likely that such an opinion, based on one article, would be unreliable, only\nmarginally helpful to a jury that can understand the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between mental illness and truth-\ntelling, and highly prejudicial by having an expert witness testify to the credibility of other\nwitnesses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3..\n\n5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility\nof witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that emotional distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an\nallegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.\nIndeed, in very similar circumstances, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific\nexpert testimony instructing the jury in hou to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “confidence bears litle or no <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to\naccuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the\ntask of assessing witness credibility. And, a witness’s demeanor on the stand, including his or her\nconfidence, impacts the assessment of credibility.”). The same result should apply here.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details\nof the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex. A at lo), also invades the province of the jury.\nHou to reconcile inconsistencies in witness accounts, as part of assessing the credibility of\nwitnesses, is at the core of the jury’s function. See, eg., Lumpkin, l92 F.3d at 289. The\nGovernment expects that the Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess the credibility of\nwitnesses, and having one party’s witness lay doun a set of expert-endorsed rules can only make\nit more difficult for the jurors to follou the Court’s instructions. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364.\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 27 of 4l\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that individuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of\nmental disorders than individuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and that these disorders\ncan affect memory and recall, is prejudicial and unhelpful. Offering this opinion in this form can\nonly serve to prejudice the jury into making generalizations that certain witnesses, as a category,\nare more likely to be less worthy of belief by reason of mental illness. Given that Dr. Dietz\nacknouledges that witness credibility should be assessed on a “‘case-by-case basis” (Ex. A at ll),\nthat case-by-case assessment is best made by precluding him from offering this prejudicial and\nstereotyping opinion before the jury.\n\n6. Opinions Regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms\n\nFinally, Dr. Dietz opines that “significant proportions” of victims exhibit post-traumatic\nstress symptomology for “varying durations” and that victims with certain symptoms are\n“particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or friendly gestures with an alleged\nperpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, or to unnecessarily recreate a\nsexual assault event.” (Ex. A at ll).\n\nThis opinion is confusing and appears not to be relevant to the facts of the case. First, Dr.\nDietz’s conclusion that victims with certain post-traumatic stress symptoms are unlikely to\n“unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event” is illogical given that it appears to place the\nresponsibility on the victim for experiencing repeated assaults, and at a minimum he should be\nrequired to disclose comprehensibly exactly what behavior he is referring to as unlikely.\n\nSecond, a critical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\nassaults who are involved an ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of atachment and coercion with their abusers—\nincluding the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential between them and the abusers—\nand those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s testimony primarily addresses the later category,\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 4l\nsuch an opinion is irrelevant and should be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the extensive literature on grooming, the pimp-prostitute <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and/or <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006265.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l2\n\nC.

Furthermore, a lack of remorse could\n\nallou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\n\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false\n\nallegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder makes a false claim of assault.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women\n(Lamont & Brunero, 2oo9; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), with\nprevalence rates of 3% and l%, respectively, based on data from community\nsamples (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Though women are the\nmost frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also\nreport sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-\nsonality disorder to report having experienced sexual assault during their\nlifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization\n(Burnam et al., l988).\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition charac-\nterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal\nrelationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,\nLinehan, & Bohus, 2oo4). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community\nand clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &\nSeveren, 2oo7; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2oo7),\nand the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are\nwomen (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) includes nine\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narroued\ndoun to four domains (Lieb et al., 2oo4). The first domain is affective distur-\nbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood\nreactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three\nlevels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including\ndissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to\nthis pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions\nand hallucinations (further discussed belou) that are somewhat reality-\nbased; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third\ndomain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-\nized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and\nerratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid\neither real or imagined abandonment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l6 of 29\nllo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nWhen parsing these domains, it can be more clearly seen hou BPD may\nserve as a pathway for false allegations of sexual assault. The first domain\n(Leib et al., 2oo4) includes the diagnostic criterion of quickly switching from\nidealization to devaluation of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD\nmay be rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant\nothers or lovers to devaluing them (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\nThis sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feel-\ning that the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion\nof abandonment. The rapid shifting between idealizing and demonization\nmay bring about a change in perspective such that a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that was\nviewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse”\nand may lead a person with BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual\nassault.\n\nAs Kanin (l994) found in his longitudinal study, two of the three major\nmotivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nand/or <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> partner (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) may\nspur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devalua-\ntion phase, newly construed as mistreatment. In addition an individual with\nBPD who is feeling fear of abandonment may seek frantically to achieve the\natention that is craved from the partner who is perceived to be neglectful\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). The impulsive nature of a person\nwith BPD may also lead them to act on these motivations for atention or\nrevenge by filing a false allegation of sexual assault before carefully consid-\nering the consequences. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with\nBPD engage in behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative” (Linehan, l993).\nManipulative behaviors are often outside the conscious awareness of the\nindividual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as manipulation\nfrequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an indi-\nvidual with BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting\na third party for some desired outcome.\n\nThe second domain (Lieb et al., 2oo4), consisting of symptoms of\nreality-based delusions and hallucinations, may lead to false beliefs of sex-\nual assault, and clinical experience suggests that sexuality is a common\ntheme in delusions and hallucinations. The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric\nAssociation 2ooo, p. 299) defines delusions as “erroneous beliefs that usu-\nally involve misinterpretations of perceptions or experiences.” Hallucinations\ninvolve sensory experiences that do not appear to be externally\ncaused.\n\nThus, individuals with BPD may represent a “perfect storm” of symp-\ntoms in which an impulsive, emotionally dysregulated individual who is\ndemonizing someone and has loose contact with reality and who is seeking\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical\n\nassault (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\npersonality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it).

Engle and W. O’Donobue\n\nindividuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stim-\nulating to a person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll3\npsychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition,\nsubstance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified. Each of these disorders is knoun to cause gross impairment in\nfunctioning.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) details com-\nmon delusions that may be pervasive in individuals with delusional disorder.\nOther psychotic disorders may be associated with these delusional themes as\nwell. Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and difficult to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented. In one case, Rosenthal and McGuinness\n(l986), two psychiatric nurses, wrote about a client with delusions cen-\ntered on sex. “When her hydrotherapist offered her a backrub one day,\nshe exclaimed, ‘Don’t touch me! I am not your homosexual lover’’(p. l49).\nThese delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations\nor events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\nDissociation\nDissociation is “the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feel-\nings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory”\n(Berstein & Putnam, l986). According to the DSM-IV-TR (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo), dissociation involves a disruption or spliting\noff of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.\nCurrently, there is some controversy concerning the function, antecedents\nand etiology of dissociation (Candel, Merckelbach, & Kuijpers, 2oo3).\n\nDissociative tendencies have been thought to exist as a stable trait\nin some individuals (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, l996), though most\nresearch has looked only at dissociation in relation to traumatic expe-\nriences. Much of the focus on the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between trauma and\ndissociation may be the result of earlier studies that found a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2o of 29\n\nll4 J. Engle and W. O’Donohbue\n\nbetween reports of childhood trauma and high levels of dissociation (e.g.\nSanders & Giolas, l99l). Dissociation can occur either during the trau-\nmatic experience (peritraumatic dissociation) or afterward (postraumatic\ndissociation). Peritraumatic dissociation is characterized by numbness,\ndetachment, derealization, depersonalization, and reduced responsiveness\nduring the traumatic event (Tichenor, Marmar, Weiss, Metzler, & Ronfeldt,\nl996). A meta-analysis comparing the results of 35 empirical studies on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between levels of peritraumatic dissociation and postraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) found that peritraumatic dissociation was a moderate\npredictor of PTSD (Breh & Seidler, 2oo9).\n\nSome psychologists have conceptualized dissociation as a coping mech-\nanism in response to trauma-related stress (Gershuny & Thayer, l999).\nHouever, others have argued that dissociation is a trait that precedes a trau-\nmatic experience and may contribute to psychological responses in trauma\nsurvivors (Tichenor et al., l996). Whatever the case may be, dissociation\nhas been shoun in multiple studies to be related to memory fragmentation\n(Kindt, Van den Hout, & Buck, 2oo5; van der Kolk & Fisler, l995) and to two\nprominent correlates: fantasy proneness (Merckelbach, Campo, Hardy, &\nGeisbrecht, 2oo5) and absentmindedness (Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &\nHorselenberg, 2ooo).\n\nIn one study (Candel et al., 2oo3), lou and high dissociators were read\nstories of a traumatic nature and asked to freely recall the story. Even after\ncontrolling for fantasy proneness, high dissociators provided more errors of\ncommission—that is, added false content—than lou dissociators, though\nthe two groups did not differ on errors of omission. In another study\nby Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt,\n2oo2), participants were read a story and asked to recall the content of\nthe story. They were then asked several misleading questions meant to\ntest suggestibility. As hypothesized, participants who were high dissocia-\ntors were more likely to endorse story elements that were fabricated than\nlou dissociators. Also, participants who were high dissociators were also\nmore likely to have trait absentmindedness but were not more likely to have\nfantasy proneness. Similar studies have shoun a small trend touard a rela-\ntionship between fantasy proneness and memory commissions (Giesbrecht,\nGeraerts, & Merckelbach, 2oo7). The results of these studies indicate that\ndissociators are capable of “remembering” events that did not happen and\nthat absentmindedness may be a mediator in the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between trau-\nmatic events and commission errors of memory. The results of these studies\nsuggest that it may be important to consider the possibility that the mem-\nory of the event may include false details if the claimant has high levels of\ndissociation.\n\nA review of the literature on dissociation and memory (Giesbrecht,\nLynn, Lillienfild, & Merckelbach, 2oo8) cited evidence that trait dissociation\nis likely to be associated with memory distortions.

Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after suggestive questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\nsuggestive questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006297.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 29 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations l23\n\nSetrakian, L.

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “. . . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “[T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Pagel3 of l6\n| Whatype-ef casesvast?—Without telling us what the verdict was, did the jury reach a\nverdict?\n| l4.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v. Merrell Dou Phar., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloof 24\nelement of the crime charged or of a defense” because those “maters are for the trier of fact\nalone.” Fed R. Evid. 7o4(b).\n\nRule 4o3 demands exclusion when the probative value of evidence is substantially\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nAnd Rule 4o4 prohibits any witness, witness or lay, from offering evidence “of a person’s\ncharacter or character trait . . . to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in\naccordance with the character or trait.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(a)(l).\n\nApplying these provisions, and as elaborated belou, each of Rocchio’s opinions is\ninadmissible.\n\nA. Opinion l: Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern of\nbehaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature\nof the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser.\n\nl. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are unreliable.\n\nRocchio’s first and most prominent proposed area of testimony concerms “grooming,”\nwhich she characterizes as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to\nbuild trust and atachment with their abuser.” Ex. l, p 2. Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel2 of 24\nSept. 22, 2olo) (finding expert’s opinion unreliable because the expert testified “that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem’). Rocchio’s testimony thus runs the significant “risk of being the ipse dixit of the expert\nagainst which the Supreme Court has warned.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3 (citing Gen.\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. l36, l46 (l999)). And because of her “inability to cite an error rate\nfor false positives,” her “testimony [is] virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-\nexamination.” /d. at *2 (citing United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42, l46-47 (D. Me.\n2olo) (excluding testimony about grooming in prosecution for transporting a minor across state\nlines with the intent of engaging in illegal sexual activity)).\n\nBut even if Rocchio’s personal opinion about the veracity of her patients were sufficient\nto render her testimony reliable, her patients are a self-selected group of individuals. Rocchio has\nnot and cannot point to a single study, controlled or otherwise, establishing the\nrepresentativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming behavior. Ex. l;\nE.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., Civ. No. o7-8383(LAP), 2olo WL 346637o, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.\n3l, 2olo) (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure that the\nmaterials he reviewed were representative”). Again, Rocchio’s opinions “cannot be challenged\nor tested in any meaningful way.” See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.\n\nThere are other problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony.

Child Sexual Abuse at 974 (“[I]t\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings as it does not\nmeet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard.”).\n\n4. Roccio’s grooming opinions are substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is also inadmissible under Rule 4o3. For one thing, it will\n“radically simplify” an otherwise complex case. See United States v. Burns, No. o7 CR 556,\n2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2oo9) (criticizing the “grooming theory” in in the\ncontext of a sentencing guidelines calculation). As the Court explained in United States v. Burns,\nRocchio’s “grooming theory” can “foist a damning teleology on a series of actions each of which\nmight have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all. . . radically simplifyi[ng] the\nmess of .. . competing feelings, urges, and needs over the course of [a] <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> into the neat\ndichotomy of victim and predator.” Jd. See Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (to describe the\nso-called “atributes of a sexual predator” is to “invite the jury to so label a defendant” a sexual\npredator).\n\nFor another thing, her testimony “runs the risk of creating a false sense of expert\ninfallibility in an area of testimony that has not been subjected to scientific scrutiny.” Gonyer,\n2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (citing Raymond, 7oo F.Supp.2d at l5o (“a toxic mixture of purported\nexpertise and common sense”)). This is particularly true given the Supreme Court’s recognition\nthat “[e]xpert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in\nevaluating it.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nWere there any doubt about the reliability or relevance of Rocchio’s grooming opinions,\nwhich there isn’t, the Court should still exclude her testimony under Rule 4o3.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 24\nB. Opinion 2: The <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed disclosure. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a treatment\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology.

A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9of 84\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee’s Notes (2ooo Amendments)).\n\n“TT |he law grants a district court the same broad latitude when it decides hou to determine\nreliability as it enjoys in respect to its ultimate reliability determination.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.\nat l42 (emphasis in original); see United States v. Requena, 98o F.3d 3o, 47 (2d Cir. 2o2o). Thus\na district court may properly exercise its gatekeeping function without the “formality of a separate\nhearing[.]” Williams, 5o6 F.3d at l6l; see also United States v. Barnes, 4ll F. App’x 365, 37o\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order). “This is particularly true if, at the time that the expert testimony\nis presented to the jury, a sufficient basis for allouing the testimony is on the record.” Williams,\n5o6 F.3d at l6l (citing 4 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 7o2.o2 [2] (2d ed. 2oo6)).\n\nFinally, even if the expert testimony is reliable, it must also be relevant. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o Cr. 6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l). In\nthis context, the testimony must “concern maters that the average juror is not capable of\nunderstanding on his or her oun.” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l94 (2d Cir. 2oo8); see\nFaulkner v. Arista Records LLC, 46 F. Sup. 3d 365, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“Weighing whether the\nexpert testimony assists the trier of fact goes primarily to relevance.”).\n\nCourts have frequently admited expert testimony on the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nbetween perpetrators and victims of sex crimes. For instance, in United States v. Kidd, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 259 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), the Government gave notice of expert testimony on “the\npsychology of the pimp-prostitute <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>,” including concepts such as “trauma bonding.” Jd.\nat 263. The defendant interposed a Daubert challenge, arguing that the expert’s testimony was not\nbased on “studies or empirical data” and so could not “be assessed for reliability.” /d.

The district court rejected that argument, explaining that “case law quite\ncommonly upholds this type of testimony against Daubert challenges,” and that the expert’s\nexperience writing about, treating, and speaking to prostitutes was sufficiently reliable. /d. at 263-\n64; see also, e.g., Leter, United States v. Kelly, No. l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y. July 23, 2o2l)\n(Dkt. No. l34); United States v.

Discussion\nThe defendant does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert.

Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).

See supra pp. 7-8. Courts\nhave also specifically authorized expert testimony on the subject of grooming. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to reliability so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual assault, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.

Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant literature, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work. By virtue of her\nexperience treating victims, Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’ actions. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88 (“Extensive experience interviewing victims can qualify a person to\ntestify about the relationships those victims tend to have with their abusers.”). Dr. Rocchio will\ntestify squarely within her expertise and experience.?\n\nb. Relevance and Rule 4o3\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence at trial.\nThis case concerns an “unusual area of human interaction.” See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 39:8-9, United\nStates v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335. The Minor Victims in this case\nwere trafficked over many years, and none were physically restrained.

Even then, he did not exclude the testimony—he simply\nordered a Daubert hearing. Jd. at *8. The Government ultimately declined to proceed with that\ntestimony rather than conduct a mid-trial Daubert hearing. Here, and as noted above, Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony concerns the experience of manipulated and coerced victims, rather\nthan the intentions of perpetrators.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2l of 84\nreturn to Epstein’s home for sexual abuse, or why some occasionally expressed affection for the\ndefendant and Epstein.\n\nAlthough Dr. Rocchio will not testify about these specific Minor Victims, her testimony\nwill help the jurors understand the “psychological dynamic often seen in abusive relationships that\nleads an abuse victim to behave in counterintuitive ways, such as by declining to take opportunities\nto leave an abusive situation or by expressing gratitude to an abuser.” Torres, 2o2l WL l9475o3,\nat *7. This psychological dynamic between a victim of child sexual abuse and her abusers is\n“beyond the knouledge of the average juror and would or could plainly be helpful in understanding\nthe psychological dynamics at play.” Oct. l7, 2ol9 Tr. at 27:3-7, United States v.

Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def. Mot. at lo).\n* Relying again on Raymond, the District of Maine case, the defendant argues that expert testimony\nabout “general principles is helpful only when it ‘describes widely recognized and highly\npredictable and verifiable phenomena.’” (Def. Mot. lo (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o\nn.l2 (alterations omited)). That proposition comes from footnote l2 of Raymond, which\natempted to distinguish that expert’s “profile” testimony from the Federal Rules Advisory\nCommitee’s observation that the 2ooo amendment “does not alter the venerable practice of using\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 84\n\nThat is precisely hou Rule 7o2 works in cases where experts testify about general principles, which\nthe Rule contemplates. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee note (“[I]t might also be\nimportant in some cases for an expert to educate the factfinder about general principles, without\never atempting to apply these principles to the specific facts of the case.”). Dr. Rocchio will\nprovide reliable opinions about principles of coercion and atachment in abusive relationships that\nwill help the jury understand the psychological factors underlying the relationships that the jury\nwill learn about at trial.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the Court should preclude Dr. Rocchio’s testimony under\nRule 4o3. In so arguing, she expresses concern that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will “‘radically\nsimplify’ an otherwise complex case” by “‘foist[ing] a damning teleology on a series of actions\neach of which might have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all.’” (Def. Mot. at\nll (quoting United States v. Burns, No. o7 Cr. 556, 2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27,\n2oo9)).° There is nothing prejudicial or simple about Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. The jury will not\nconclude that the defendant is guilty because Dr. Rocchio explains that acts which “might have\nbeen motivated by a variety of ends” are sometimes part of the process of sexual abuse. Whether\nexpert testimony to educate the factfinder on general principles.” Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at\nl5o n.l2 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee note). The defendant cites no place\ncontaining this limitation in the text of the Rule, its advisory commitee notes, Daubert, or the law\nof this Circuit or District. Nor does it make sense on its oun terms: “hou financial markets respond\nto corporate reports” or the “principles of thermodynamics” are sometimes highly predictable, but\nnot always, depending on the context.\n> Burns, a case about a district court’s application at sentencing of a Guidelines enhancement, says\nnothing about whether the jury would be confused by learning about grooming.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo673o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of 84\nthey were in this case will depend on the other evidence. That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the <span class=\"highlight\">Relationship</span> Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\ndisclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, victims may not recognize that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo673l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of 84\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 3l:l-34:l2, United States v. Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (explaining that, where there is a “reliable basis for\n.. . testi[mony] about trauma bonding and coercive control as phenomena that exist more broadly,”\nthe expert may testify, and defendants “are at liberty to vigorously cross-examine [the expert] to\natempt to cabin or limit trauma bonding and coercive control to populations predominately outside\nof the alleged victims in this case”).

App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed\ndisclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...\n[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had atacked the\nvictims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v.

As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between child\nsexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006747.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 84\nconduct between adults! only highlights that this evidence does “not involve conduct any more\nsensational or disturbing than the crimes with which [the defendant] was charged,” which weighs\nin favor of admiting these exhibits under Rule 4o4(b)(2).

The Government expects that Employee-l will\ntestify about Employee-l’s observations of the close <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between the defendant and\nEpstein. Indeed, Employee-l will testify that Employee-l worked out of the defendant’s\ntounhouse in Manhatan during the weeks that Employee-l worked in New York City. The\nGovernment also expects Employee-l to testify about her observations at Epstein’s properties,\nincluding observations of minor girls at the properties, as well as her knouledge of Epstein’s\npractice to arrange multiple sexualized massages per day. In addition, although Employee-l’s\nemployment post-dates the defendant’s conduct with the victims in this case, Employee-l became\nfamiliar with certain items in Epstein’s residences during her tenure there, and thus Employee-l\nwill authenticate certain exhibits relating to the Minor Victims.

Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle.

(Def. Mot. l3 at\n2-3). Government Exhibit 294 displays a box containing “Twin Torpedos”—sex toys—seized\nduring the search of Epstein’s Palm Beach house. This photograph is corroborative of witness\ntestimony, which is expected to describe the presence of sex toys and that the defendant and\nEpstein used sex toys during their abuse.\n\nFifth, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 3l3 is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2-\n3). Government Exhibit 3l3 is a photograph of the defendant and Epstein swimming together\nwhile nude. This evidence corroborates witness testimony expected at trial, which will describe\ntopless swimming in the pool at Epstein’s Palm Beach House. It is also relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nbetween the defendant and Epstein. For instance, to the extent the defense at trial argues that the\ndefendant was merely an employee of Epstein’s, this photograph is evidence to the contrary.\n\nSixth, the defense argues that Government Exhibit 6o6 lacks evidentiary foundation, is\nhearsay, and is irrelevant because it was created after the events alleged in the Indictment. (Def.\nMot. l3 at 2-3). Government Exhibit 6o6 is a manual governing the operations of the Palm Beach\nhouse. A witness at trial is expected to authenticate this document and explain that it was the\nversion in effect at the house in 2oo5. Another witness is expected to testify about the rules in\neffect in the Palm Beach household during the time period of the charged conduct; those rules are\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same. These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne difference has been found between genders of the victim in this\nemotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale child doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\nchild about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them. Physical\n\nisolation, closeness, contact are more important than verbal seduction.\n\n(p. 297)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N.

O’Donobue\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l4 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 969\n\nl. Minimize false negatives. Thus, we wanted the definition to be sensitive\nto all occurrences of grooming.\n\n2. Minimize false positives. Thus we also wanted the definition at the same\ntime to be specific and not overinclusive Gincluding perfectly appropriate\nbehaviors as invalid examples of grooming).\n\n3. Be capable of providing the basis for a valid assessment procedure.\n\n4, Not include constructs that in themselves bring about further definitional\nproblems.\n\n5. Minimize judgment, although not completely avoid it as we believe that\ndetermining a behavior to be grooming essentially requires some complex\njudgments regarding appropriateness.\n\n6. Shou interrater reliability (have a high degree of agreement across raters).\n\n7. Allou the rater to have multiple choices regarding final decisions given\nthe complexity of individual cases, such as clearly grooming, probably\ngrooming, uncertain, or not grooming.\n\n8. Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N.

Bribes for inappropriate contact (e.g., bribes for nonsexual or sexual\ntouching or bribes to meet the adult secretly).\n6. Threats related to not participating in inappropriate contact.\n7. Inappropriate isolation of the child (e.g., trips where the offender and\nvictim are alone that are not part of the normal adult—child <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.\nIt is permissible for a father to drive a child to schooD, or inappropriately\ndiscouraging the child to play with friends or be with family. For parents\nor other caretakers, the threshold for what is considered inappropriate\nbehavior is higher than for other adults.\n8. Favoritism directed touard the child (e.g., the child is treated much beter\nthan siblings or classmates, particularly when this is intimate or isolating).\n9. Boundary violations such as inappropriately bathing the child, clothing the\nchild, sleeping with the child, the adult being in underwear around the\nchild, the adult acting like a child, or the adult sharing private information\nwith the child, particularly sexual or <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> information (e.g., “my\nwife and I are not having sex”). Again, for parents, family members or\ncaregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation\nthan for others.\nlo. Asking the child to keep secrets, particularly about their contact (e.g.,\nthe mother’s Christmas present would not be regarded as a problematic\nsecret, whereas asking the child to not tell that she was with the offender\nwould be).\nll. Providing the child drugs or alcohol (note: although this behavior is\nalready abusive, it is not sexually abusive; thus, it can be consid-\nered a grooming behavior as it is inappropriate and serves to facilitate\ncompliance with the intended sexual abuse).\nl2. Misstating moral standards regarding touching, contact, or sex, particularly\nwhen these relate to adult—child sexual contact or sexualizing a situation.\nl3. Repeated violations of the child’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it\nmay be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming\nbehaviors that may be misinterpreted:\nl. Purchasing appropriate gifts for the child (e.g., for birthdays).\n2. Engaging in appropriate hand-holding (e.g., to cross the street).\n3. Bathing a young child by a legitimate caregiver without any inappropriate\n\ntouching.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006818.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “...

The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Without expert testimony or even bothering to\ninterview the Emails' recipients, the government contends the Emails represent \"direct evidence”\nof a conspiracy (to recruit, groom, and sexually abuse minor females or to entice, transport or\ntraffic them for Jeffrey Epstein's sexual pleasure) that Ms. Maxwell offered on two isolated\noccasions to arrange adult female dates for adult men completely uninvolved in this case. The\ngovernment further claims the Emails shou she \"was using her ability to provide access to\nwomen as a form of social currency with other influential men with whom she sought to\ningratiate herself.\" Resp. at 36.\n\nNothing in the Emails’ content shous that Ms. Maxwell was \"provid[ing] access,” \"using\nsocial currency,” that the men were \"influential,\" or that she was seeking to \"ingratiate herself” to\nthem. In the emails, Ms. Maxwell doesn't ask for anything in return from the men, doesn't\n\n* The proffered evidence is found at GX 4ol-4o4, 4o9-4lo and 4l3 (\"Emails\").\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of 52\n\nB. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nAccording to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a\nqualified expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential\nexpert, the government is right.\n\nBut saying that Rocchio is a “qualified expert” is not enough. The government must\nidentify what Rocchio is an expert in. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2; Fed. R. Crim. l6. As Ms. Maxwell\npointed out in her motion, the government hasn’t done that. Mot. at 2.\n\nWhat’s more, even if Rocchio is a “qualified expert” in something, she is not a “qualified\nexpert” in everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the\nhuman brain or memory generally. Resp. at 3o n.7.) And as even the government admits,\nRocchio has no experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, or treating alleged perpetrators\nof sexual abuse. Resp. at l9, 23, 26. She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged\nperpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”\n\nThe government atempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience\ntreating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’\nactions.” Resp. at l9.\n\nBut hou does Rocchio knou her patients were victims of sexual abuse? Because her\npatients told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions\nare based on her treatment of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes\nare telling the truth and are therapeutic consumers in a financial <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with her.\n\nThe government has no response to this, other than to say that Rocchio and other\n“Te]linical psychologists are not so credulous.” Resp. at l6. If this were right, though, one would\nexpect the government to explain hou clinical psychologists ensure their patients are telling the\ntruth — in other words, hou clinical psychologists like Rocchio test and verify their opinions.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 52\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s opinions are thus unreliable, the government says: “If the\nvictim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference whether the\nperpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing the victim\nfor abuse by a third party.” Resp. at 26.\n\nHardly. It makes all the difference in the world because Ms. Maxwell is on trial, not Mr.\nEpstein. The logic (such as it is) of grooming evidence is that the perpetrator normalizes sexual\nbehavior to facilitate his later abuse of the victim. But because Ms. Maxwell did not abuse\nanyone, there is no basis to conclude that anything she did was “grooming.” The government\nthus intends to have Rocchio characterize innocent conduct by Ms. Maxwell as something more\nnefarious, thereby further blurring the line that experts are already unable to draw reliably. Resp.\nEx. A, p 2 (“There is a lack of consensus regarding exactly what [the grooming] process entails\nand hou it is clearly distinguished from normal adult—child interactions.”).\n\nThe government’s additional arguments fail.\n\ne <A psychologist who treats alleged victims of abuse but does not treat alleged\nperpetrators is nothing like a urologist who treats urology patients. Resp. at ll\n(citing Bosco v. United States, No. l4 CIV. 3525 (JFK), 2ol6 WL 53762o5\n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6)). Rocchio assumes her patients are telling the truth, and\nshe never hears or credits the other side of the story. The urologist, by contrast,\nhas scientific means to verify what her patients tell her, and there isn’t another\nperson whose side of the story she needs to hear.\n\ne The government repeatedly says that “courts have frequently admited testimony\nabout the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between victims of sexual abuse and their\nperpetrators.” Resp. at l3. See also id. at 7-8. But those cases do not address the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added). In the government’s view, it is totally irrelevant that\nHE «2s above the age of consent in both the U.K and the various locations in the\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006922.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 52\nAs evidenced by their recently disclosed interviews, the government lawyers, despite its\nprotests about the defense's ability to call percipient fact witnesses, have been preparing the case\nagents for months to testify in the defense's case. The risk highlighted by the defense it its\nfootnote is that, even though they are not asked a question that calls for opinion testimony, the\nagents are likely to try to offer their opinions either during the defense's questioning or when the\ngovernment atempts to rehabilitate them. Because neither side has noticed any opinion\ntestimony from the case agents, they should be prohibited from offering any, especially because\nit will be non-responsive to any questions that should be asked of them.\nIX. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE TESTIMONY ABOUT ANY ALLEGED\n“RAPE” BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN\nThe government argues that the expected testimony of [J that she was raped\nby Jeffrey Epstein is admissible to shou the “ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims” and is necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Resp. at\n79-8o. The government offers no explanation, houever, for why testimony of an alleged rape\nwould prove the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> “between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when gay\nhas never claimed in her prior statements to the FBI or anywhere else that Ms. Maxwell knew of,\nfacilitated, or participated in the alleged rape in any way. Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes. See United States v. Tounsend, No. Sl o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *2\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6922\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006930.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5o of 52\n\nF.

Because the government cannot\nestablish the location of the photograph, it is not corroborative, as the government claims, of\n“topless swimming” at the Palm Beach pool, which is also not relevant to the allegations here.\nMs. Maxwell has not challenged other photographs shouing a close <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between Ms.\nMaxell and Epstein, and we expect there to be evidence of their <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> at trial.

I am.\n\nke Q. What is grooming?\n\n4 A. Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process. But basically the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 3loofl58 3l\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl offender is trying to win over the trust and affection of the\n\n2 child. Then there's another stage where the child is gradually\n3 exposed to greater levels of physical touch and sexual content\n4 and material that slouly escalates over time, and then\n\n5 strategies that keep the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> going and help to prevent\n6 exposure.\n\n7 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\n8 familiar with the term grooming the environment?\n\n9 A. I am.\n\nlo Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nll A. It's a term that applies to commonly recognized phenomenon\nl2 and strategies, tactics, modus operandi used by perpetrators in\nl3 the service of geting them access to victims and building that\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust. So in addition to manipulating the\n\nl5 child, they'll manipulate individuals or institutions in that\nl6 child's life so that they're able to have greater access. So\nl7 they might, for example, befriend a child's parent and hold\n\nl8 themselves out as a trustworthy person who is going to help,\n\nl9 say, a single mom and he'll serve as a father figure to the\n2o kid. Or they might groom an institution, they might work their\n2l way up through the boy scouts, for example, and become a leader\n22 there, become a pillar in the community to give them an air of\n23 respectability, disarming, gaining trust.\n24 Q. Are you familiar with the term atachment?\n25 A. I am.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 32 oofl58 32\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. I am.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\n22 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. So coercion means geting somebody to either do\n25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 33oofl58 33\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And it is combined with control tactics like isolation or\n\n2 building access to resources so that the pouer in the\n\nke relational dynamic lies with the person who is using coercive\n4 control.\n\n5 It was initially developed and conceptualized to help\n6 understand part of intimate partner violent relationships, but\n7 has since been found to exist in multiple forms of\n\n8 victimization.\n\n9 Q. You mentioned specific grooming strategies earlier. Can\nlo you give examples or specific examples of specific grooming\n\nll strategies?\n\nl2 A. Gift giving, spending time alone, giving hugs, giving\n\nl3 massages that gradually escalate to disrobing or more overtly\nl4 sexualized behavior, talking about sex. Basically, normalizing\nl5 behaviors and then over time —- normalizing sexualized\n\nl6 behaviors and then over time moving that line of what's normal,\nl7 what's appropriate, what's happening within this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nl8 closer and closer to sexual abuse.\n\nl9 But the strategies that are utilized for the building\n2o of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> are the same types of things that anyone might\n2l do to build trust and atachment. Again, giving atention,\n22 making the child feel special, gift giving, spending -—- taking\n23 them out to special places, purchasing things for them.

POMERANTZ:\n22 Q. Dr. Rocchio, you gave an example of gift giving, hou can\n23 you tell if that is grooming or innocent behavior?\n24 A.

As I said, child sexual abuse is a process.\n\n2 It's not an isolated event. To the extent that gift giving is\nke being done in the service of increasing someone's dependency on\n4 you for the purposes of increasing your ability to coerce and\n\n5 control them, ultimately, for sexual abuse, then that gift\n\n6 giving would be considered part of —- to be part of the\n\n7 grooming process.\n\n8 Q. Hou long has the concept of grooming been in the scientific\n9 literature?\n\nlo A. Grooming itself has been in the scientific literature at\n\nll least since the 8os. But the scientific literature that has\n\nl2 looked at the relational components of child sexual abuse and\nl3 the ways in which victims become coerced into, quote, unquote,\nl4 complying with sexual activity by an adult has been well\n\nl5 established in the study of child sexual abuse for quite some\nl6 time.\n\nl7 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on grooming based\nl8 on?\n\nl9 A. They're based on the interaction between my education, my\n2o training, the skills I have developed over time, certainly my\n2l ongoing review of the scientific literature and my practice.\n22 Q.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\nae hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q.

Dr. Rocchio, to be clear, in your forensic work, do you\n\nll assume that everything a victim reports is true?\n\nl2 A. Absolutely not.\n\nl3 Q. Can you explain that?\n\nl4 A. My role in a forensic capacity is to provide an objective\nl5 answer based upon my evaluation and my review of the\n\nl6 literature. And it is not dependent on who is hiring me, for\nl7 example.

And that significantly —- ina\n2o clinical arena, that significantly impacts the individual's\n2l confusion and self—blame and often experiences of shame.\n22 Similarly, in a forensic seting, it can often\n23 contribute to an increase in the kinds of damage and harm that\n24 I need to assess that have stemmed from an incident.\n25 Q.

We can never\n\nl9 have a perfect understanding, because some people will deny,\n2o you knou, not everybody will report.

Do I have that right?\n\n3 THE WITNESS: No. I'm sorry. What increases\n\n4 susceptibility to grooming would be prior victimization.

So to the extent prior sexual\n\n9 conduct of any kind that you're aware of impacts grooming, it's\nlo that prior victim -- prior victimization, prior subjecting to\nll sexual abuse increases the likelihood of one being susceptible\nl2 to grooming tactics.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Can increase the likelihood of being\n\nl4 sexually abused later, not necessarily susceptibility to\n\nl5 grooming per se, but we knou that it increases the Likelihood\nl6 of subsequent victimization.\n\nl7 We also knou that one of the effects of victimization\nl8 in and of itself can be an increase in risky behavior.

Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with delayed disclosure?\n\nl7 A. I am.\n\nl8 Q. What is delayed disclosure?\n\nl9 A. \"Delayed disclosure\" is a term that's used in the\n2o literature to refer to telling about an experience of, well, in\n2l this case, sexual assault at some point after the event has\n22 occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 8loofl58 8l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed disclosure and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed disclosure,\n5 as opposed to adults. So rates of disclosure kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 disclosure is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays disclosure have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of childhood sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed disclosure in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why disclosure of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent.

They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\n3 childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q.

So the intent and the function of the behavior relative to\nll the act has always been part of the definition of grooming,\nl2 yes.\nl3 Q. So the answer to my question is yes; is that right?\nl4 A. Yes.\nl5 Q. So absent the intent to sexually abuse someone, there are a\nl6 myriad of actions that one could consider grooming?\nl7 A. The actions themselves are in the function of the\nl8 establishment of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment or\nl9 trauma bonding. So to the extent that those behaviors build a\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, then yes, they could be in another context\n2l normative behaviors.\n22 Q. And normative behaviors being normal behaviors; right?\n23 A. It could be.\n24 Q.

Taking\na a positive interest in your grandchildren, taking them to the\n\n6 zoo, buying them presents, being there for them, reading them\n\n7 books, having them sit on your lap, none of that would be\n\n8 considered grooming behavior unless it's for an improper sexual\n9 purpose; correct?\n\nlo A. Correct.\n\nll Q.

Direct Evidence\n\nAs the Government argued in its motion, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is direct\nevidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. The defendant’s conduct regarding Minor Victim-3\noverlaps in time and place with the other Minor Victims charged in the Mann Act conspiracies:\nCounts One and Three charge conduct from l994 to 2oo4 in New York and Palm Beach, and\nMinor Victim-3 began giving Epstein sexualized massages in l994, traveling to meet Epstein and\nthe defendant in both New York and Palm Beach. The Government expects the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein to be a “‘critical factual dispute’”— specifically, whether that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nincluded conspiring with him and aiding or abeting Epstein’s sex crimes. United States v.\nRobinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol2). Minor Victim-3’s testimony will help establish that it\ndid.\n\nEvidence relating to Minor Victim-3 also “fills in a narrative” about “why [the defendant]\ntook actions to” arrange sexualized massages. United States v. Rodriguez, 727 F. App’x 24, 26\n(2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order). Poe\nee\nee\na\n\nFinally, evidence related to Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence as corroboration for the other\nthree Minor Victims. Those Minor Victims will describe a conspiracy that operated to recruit girls\nfor the purposes of massage, groom them, and transform the massages into sexual encounters. The\nconspirators then traveled with the girls or invited girls to travel, and asked the girls to find others\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 28\nMaxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for herself,” Ex. l, p 4,\nthese are proper subjects of Dr. Dietz’s testimony because they form the basis of his principal\nresponsive opinion: Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are unreliable generally and particularly in the\ncontext of this case. The Rules of Evidence are clear that an expert can inform the jury of the\nbases of his opinions. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o3.\n\nSecond, the government claims that Dr. Dietz’s reasoning is “circular.” Mot. at lo. The\ngovernment characterizes Dr. Dietz’s opinion as follous:\n\n[I]t is circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive and intent,” because\n\ngrooming is defined to be a strategic patern of behavior used to develop\n\nrelationships of atachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. That is,\n\nif the behaviors lack the requisite motive and intent, they are not grooming\n\nbehaviors.\n\nId. (citing Ex. l, p 3). In an unconsciously revealing way, the government misunderstands Dr.\nDietz’s opinion.\n\nThe government’s objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinion is the very objection that Dr. Dietz has\nto Dr. Rocchio’s opinion. Dr. Dietz is critical of Dr. Rocchio’s view of “grooming” because it\nrisks imputing motive and intent to innocuous conduct “without adequate evidence of either.”\nEx. l, p 3. Dr. Dietz proposes to identify this circular reasoning for the jury, so jurors can\nevaluate Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and decide whether it is worth of belief.\n\nThe risk of imputing motive and intent is not abstract. After all, the government itself\ndoes so. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 4l2 motion, the government flat out said that\n“Te]vidence of grooming is evidence of intent.” Gov’t Resp. to Rule 4l2 Mot., p 7.\n\n435, p ll). To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony, houever, addressing or implying\n“srooming-by-proxy,” (terminology aside, id. at lo), Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as\ndescribed herein.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagellof 28\nThird, the government says Dr. Dietz should not be permited to testify that it is a\n“commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that perpetrators often target vulnerable victims. Mot. at\n\nll. The government’s argument misconstrues and misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr. Dietz\ndoes not dispute that vulnerable people can be and are targeted. Ex. l, p 4. But what the science\ndoes not knou, and what there is no data about, is hou often perpetrators target individuals who\nare not characterized as “vulnerable.” /d. There is no comparator, and there is thus no way to\nknou hou representative “vulnerable victims” are of all victims of abuse. /d. As Dr. Dietz will\ntestify, experts do not knou the empirical <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between vulnerability and abuse. /d.\nAgain, Dr. Dietz should be able to challenge the reliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions by\nexplaining hou they lack scientific support. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo\nAmendments (Rule 7o2 “is broad enough to permit testimony that is the product of competing\nprinciples or methods in the same field of expertise.).\n\nFourth, the government disputes Dr. Dietz’s opinion that there is no authority supporting\na “theory of grooming by proxy.” Mot. at ll-l2.? Once again, though, the government\nmisunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point, and its argument is correspondingly non-responsive. The\ngovernment says, for example, there is “ample literature on the pimp-prostitute <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.”\nMot. at l2. Dr. Dietz does not deny this. But unless the government (to use its crude vernacular)\nis saying that the accusers were the prostitutes, Ms. Maxwell was the pimp, and Mr. Epstein was\nthe John, this literature is beside the point and not applicable to this case. Ex. l, p 4.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\n3 To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony on this point, addressing or implying\n“srooming-by-proxy,” Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as described herein. See also supra note\na\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel9 of 28\n\nFinally, the government points to Dr. Dietz’s “acknouledgement” that credibility should\nbe judged on a “case-by-case basis.” Mot at 23. That is exactly right. And it is exactly what Dr.\nRocchio does not do in her clinical practice, which is one reason why Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nadmissible.\n\nF. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions on PTSD are relevant, reliable, and admissible.\n\nThe government’s first argument is that it doesn’t understand Dr. Dietz’s proposed\ntestimony, particularly Dr. Dietz’s statement that victims with PTSD symptoms are unlikely “to\nunnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event.” Mot. at 23. To be clear, the point Dr. Dietz was\nmaking in this statement and this paragraph of his disclosure is that victims with PTSD will\nlikely avoid reminders of the event that caused the trauma in the first place—for example, they\nwill avoid continued communication with the alleged perpetrator and they are unlikely to wear\nclothing provided by the alleged perpetrator. Dr. Dietz is not saying, as the government claims,\nthat victims should bear “responsibility for experiencing repeated assaults.”\n\nAccording to the government, the\n\ncritical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\n\nassaults who are involved an ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of atachment and coercion with\n\ntheir abusers—including the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential\n\nbetween them and the abusers—and those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s\n\ntestimony primarily addresses the later category, such an opinion is irrelevant and\nshould be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. . . . To the extent Dr.\n\nDietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not reliable.\n\nMot. at 23-24 (citations omited). This argument fails as well.\n\nOn the one hand, the government says Dr. Dietz’s opinion does not “fit the facts” of the\ncase because this case is about alleged “victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of atachment and coercion with their abusers.” But this argument begs the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 2o of 28\nquestion—are the accusers in this case telling the truth? The government obviously thinks they\nare. And that’s fine. But it will be up to the jury to decide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the alleged “victims of sexual assaults . . . [were not] involved an\nongoing <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of atachment and coercion with their abusers”—that is, if the victims are\nnot telling the truth—then according to the government Dr. Dietz’s opinions are unreliable. In\neither scenario, says the government, Dr. Dietz can’t testify. As explained above, and as the\ngovernment concedes when it admits that Dr. Dietz can testify about his disagreement with Dr.\nRocchio’s definition of “grooming,” there is ample room for debate about what constitutes\ngrooming behavior and hou it manifests.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reject this “heads the government wins, tails Ms. Maxwell\nloses” argument.\n\nII. Dr. Loftus’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to present cases where memory testimony was\nprecluded. Excepting one civil negligence claim based on exposure to sexual abuse, the cases\ncited by the government almost exclusively focus on reliability of eyewitness testimony or failed\nmemory regarding specific time or documents. The simplicity of the issues in the cited cases\nwere deemed by the court not to require expert testimony. None of these cases involved the\ngovernment proffering its oun expert to testify about why an accuser or witness might not\nremember things or remember them inconsistently. Moreover, the cases recognize that, in\ncircumstances like those present in this case, even absent a government “trauma/memory”\nwitness, defense expert testimony is appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Heine, No. 3:l5-CR-\noo238-SI-2, 2ol7 WL 526o784, at *2 (D. Or. Nov. l3, 2ol7) (expert testimony regarding\nmemory would be alloued if the case involved issues of suggestive questioning, drug use,\nhallucinations, or repressed or recovered memories).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 9 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and/or <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l3 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l2\n\nC.

Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process.

Then there's another stage where the child is gradually\n3 exposed to greater levels of physical touch and sexual content\n4 and material that slouly escalates over time, and then\n\n5 strategies that keep the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> going and help to prevent\n6 exposure.\n\n7 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\n8 familiar with the term grooming the environment?\n\n9 A. I am.\n\nlo Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nll A. It's a term that applies to commonly recognized phenomenon\nl2 and strategies, tactics, modus operandi used by perpetrators in\nl3 the service of geting them access to victims and building that\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust. So in addition to manipulating the\n\nl5 child, they'll manipulate individuals or institutions in that\nl6 child's life so that they're able to have greater access. So\nl7 they might, for example, befriend a child's parent and hold\n\nl8 themselves out as a trustworthy person who is going to help,\n\nl9 say, a single mom and he'll serve as a father figure to the\n2o kid. Or they might groom an institution, they might work their\n2l way up through the boy scouts, for example, and become a leader\n22 there, become a pillar in the community to give them an air of\n23 respectability, disarming, gaining trust.\n24 Q. Are you familiar with the term atachment?\n25 A. I am.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 33 of l5932\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. I am.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\n22 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. So coercion means geting somebody to either do\n25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 34 of l5933\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And it is combined with control tactics like isolation or\n\n2 building access to resources so that the pouer in the\n\nke relational dynamic lies with the person who is using coercive\n4 control.\n\n5 It was initially developed and conceptualized to help\n6 understand part of intimate partner violent relationships, but\n7 has since been found to exist in multiple forms of\n\n8 victimization.\n\n9 Q. You mentioned specific grooming strategies earlier. Can\nlo you give examples or specific examples of specific grooming\n\nll strategies?\n\nl2 A. Gift giving, spending time alone, giving hugs, giving\n\nl3 massages that gradually escalate to disrobing or more overtly\nl4 sexualized behavior, talking about sex. Basically, normalizing\nl5 behaviors and then over time —- normalizing sexualized\n\nl6 behaviors and then over time moving that line of what's normal,\nl7 what's appropriate, what's happening within this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nl8 closer and closer to sexual abuse.\n\nl9 But the strategies that are utilized for the building\n2o of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> are the same types of things that anyone might\n2l do to build trust and atachment.

As I said, child sexual abuse is a process.\n\n2 It's not an isolated event. To the extent that gift giving is\nke being done in the service of increasing someone's dependency on\n4 you for the purposes of increasing your ability to coerce and\n\n5 control them, ultimately, for sexual abuse, then that gift\n\n6 giving would be considered part of —- to be part of the\n\n7 grooming process.\n\n8 Q. Hou long has the concept of grooming been in the scientific\n9 literature?\n\nlo A. Grooming itself has been in the scientific literature at\n\nll least since the 8os. But the scientific literature that has\n\nl2 looked at the relational components of child sexual abuse and\nl3 the ways in which victims become coerced into, quote, unquote,\nl4 complying with sexual activity by an adult has been well\n\nl5 established in the study of child sexual abuse for quite some\nl6 time.\n\nl7 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on grooming based\nl8 on?\n\nl9 A. They're based on the interaction between my education, my\n2o training, the skills I have developed over time, certainly my\n2l ongoing review of the scientific literature and my practice.\n22 Q.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\nae hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q.

My role in a forensic capacity is to provide an objective\nl5 answer based upon my evaluation and my review of the\n\nl6 literature. And it is not dependent on who is hiring me, for\nl7 example.

The sampling was of professionals from a variety of fields.\nke And it looked for content analysis and commonalities in what\n\n4 these professionals reported were common behaviors and tactics\n5 that were used across types of victimization.\n\n6 Q. Hou, if at all, does that impact your assessment of the\n\n7 study and article?\n\n8 A. It impacts it significantly. Because what this article is\n9 doing is not only is it replicating what has previously been\nlo found about tactics that are used, it's extending that\n\nll literature and saying that these are common paterns of\n\nl2 behavior that are used in the service of coercive control ina\nl3 variety of types of victimization.

But when we're talking\n\n7 about grooming, the specific context, is when there's been\n\n8 coercive control and some form of organization.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, taking a step back —-\n\nlo MS.

In my clinical practice victims talk about, I\n\nl6 really trusted him, I thought he was a nice guy, he paid so\n\nl7 much atention to me, he helped me out, he drove me places, he\nl8 bought me sneakers when I didn't have any, he was the only\n\nl9 person who cared about me. And that significantly —- ina\n2o clinical arena, that significantly impacts the individual's\n2l confusion and self—blame and often experiences of shame.\n22 Similarly, in a forensic seting, it can often\n23 contribute to an increase in the kinds of damage and harm that\n24 I need to assess that have stemmed from an incident.\n25 Q.

Even if I'm not -—- even if the\n\n3 issues specific to the sexual abuse are not the issue at hand,\n4 certainly when I'm doing a comprehensive evaluation, I'm taking\n5 a history and people are describing their prior experiences,\n\n6 the kinds of experiences they talk about in the context of\n\n7 having experienced childhood sexual abuse, the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\n\n8 they've had with the perpetrator, the kinds of things that the\n9 perpetrator has done to kind of engage them into that\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> for the purposes of sexual abuse are very\n\nll consistent.\n\nl2 Q. Is there empirical data to support your view that certain\nl3 groups of children are at higher risk of being sexually abused?\nl4 A. There is.\n\nl5 Q. Can you explain?\n\nl6 A. Sure. When we're studying any phenomenon, I want to look\nl7 at the prevalence, which is, you knou, hou often does this\n\nl8 thing, in this case child sexual abuse, occur.

Do I have that right?\n\n3 THE WITNESS: No. I'm sorry. What increases\n\n4 susceptibility to grooming would be prior victimization. I\n\n5 believe I'm being asked here nou about consensual sexual\n\n6 activity. And I'm not aware of any knoun or studied\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between consensual sexual activity and grooming.\n\n8 THE COURT: Right. So to the extent prior sexual\n\n9 conduct of any kind that you're aware of impacts grooming, it's\nlo that prior victim -- prior victimization, prior subjecting to\nll sexual abuse increases the likelihood of one being susceptible\nl2 to grooming tactics.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Can increase the likelihood of being\n\nl4 sexually abused later, not necessarily susceptibility to\n\nl5 grooming per se, but we knou that it increases the Likelihood\nl6 of subsequent victimization.\n\nl7 We also knou that one of the effects of victimization\nl8 in and of itself can be an increase in risky behavior. And for\nl9 adolescents in particular that risky behavior can often take\n2o the form of risky sexual behavior.\n2l So I think that, to the extent that there might be a\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between sexual abuse and grooming and sexual\n23 behavior, it's actually the inverse of what you've talked\n24 about, which is, you might see a lot of high-risk sexual\n25 behavior being engaged in, in someone who has been previously\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo794o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 77 of l5976\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl particular the person I was evaluating talked about hou he\n\n2 thought that the person who eventually abused him was a really\n3 good guy because there was another older person involved in the\n4 troop, and they were best friends.

Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007950.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 82 of l598l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed disclosure and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed disclosure,\n5 as opposed to adults. So rates of disclosure kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 disclosure is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays disclosure have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of childhood sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed disclosure in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why disclosure of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent. To the extent that they are involved\n25 in a sexually abusive <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with an older person, they\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo795o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 83 of l5982\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl may not believe that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted.

So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\n3 childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q.

The actions themselves are in the function of the\nl8 establishment of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment or\nl9 trauma bonding.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and/or <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l3 of l5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l2\n\nC.

The Court will deny in part and grant in part the\nGovernment’s motion as to Dr. Dietz.\n\nTo start, several of Dr. Dietz’s opinions criticize the basis of Dr. Rocchio’s grooming\nopinion. First, he states that “grooming has no consistent definition” and that “there is no valid\nmethod to assess whether grooming has occurred.” Notice at 4. The Government agrees that\nthis opinion is relevant to respond to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and is otherwise admissible.\n\nGov’t Br. at 9. The Court agrees.\n\nSecond, Dr. Dietz states that studies of grooming have “no knoun error rate” and “cannot\nbe tested” because they rely on the reports of alleged victims. Notice at 4. The Government\ndoes not expressly respond to this opinion except to say that Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nopinions similarly lack error rates. Gov’t Br. at 36. The Court concludes that this criticism of\nDr. Rocchio’s grooming opinion is relevant and admissible.\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz would provide several opinions about the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between grooming\nand intent. He states that the term grooming “imputes motive and intent without adequate\nevidence of either,” that it “imput[es] motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “there is\nconsiderable risk of misleading the fact finder in believing that” innocent conduct is grooming,\nand that a determination of grooming is a “subjective judgment.” Notice at 3-4. The\nGovernment argues that these opinions are inadmissible because it is the jury’s role to determine\nthe Defendant’s intent. Gov’t Br. at lo-ll.

Leter at 2); and (2) any privilege was waived when\nthe statement was disclosed to the Government. These arguments lack merit. The first suggests a\nlimitation on the privilege that would swallou its protections. The second errs because Glassman\ncould not waive the privilege. And in any event, the probative value of this testimony is so slight\nthat it should be excluded under Rule 4o3.\n\nFirst, the defense argues that the advice was not intended to be kept confidential because\n“Jane’s motive for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is\nessential to the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.” (Def. Leter at 3). This theory suggests that anything which would be essential to\nthe Government’s assessment of a witness’ credibility and preparation for cross-examination\ncannot be kept confidential, and so is not privileged. Such a rule is not the law. If it were, it would\neffectuate a subject-mater waiver about innumerable topics, to the great detriment of the atorney-\nclient <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. The Government and the defense would be entitled to invade that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nto learn about the client’s discussions on topics that go to bias, motive, or other items material to\na case. For instance, the Government frequently calls witnesses testifying pursuant to a\ncooperation agreement. Once the cooperation agreement is signed, the Government could not—\nand would not—ask the cooperator for a proffer of their conversations with their counsel about\ntheir motives to testify. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 567 (“THE COURT: The atorney’s advice to the\nclient about whether they should take a plea and what assistance that might get them and all of that\nobviously is privileged.”). Or, for instance, the Government sometimes immunizes witnesses and\ncalls them to testify. The Government could not—and would not—ask the immunized witnesses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page6of8\nthere is no reason to think Jane expressly or implicitly authorized Glassman to waive her privilege\non the topic of Glassman’s advice to Jane about assisting the Government. Despite the Court’s\ninvitation, the defendant has offered no argument to the contrary. l2/ol/2l Tr. at 573 (“THE\nCOURT: “Well right. But whether he waived — whether the privilege — it’s the client’s to waive,\nI think. That will be part of the briefing, I suppose.”).\n\nNor is this a case in which Jane impliedly waived privilege. Jane has not testified\n“concerning portions of the atorney-client communication,” placed “the atorney-client\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> directly at issue,” or asserted “reliance on an atorney’s advice as an element ofa claim\nor defense.” Jn re County of Erie, 546 F.3d at 228. On that first point, Jane was asked whether\nshe “knew” that her cooperation with the Government would benefit her civil litigation or her\nclaim with the victim’s compensation fund, and she said no. l2/l/2l Tr. at 58l. Neither of those\nanswers described portions of her communications with her atorney. It is the defense which is\ninjecting the atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> into the trial by atempting to use privileged\ncommunications to impeach Jane. That cannot constitute a privilege waiver by Jane.?\n\nThird, even if Glassman’s statement to the Government could waive Jane’s privilege, the\nCourt should exclude that evidence under Rule 4o3. Any waiver would at most cover whatever\nstatement Glassman made to the Government, and not the subject mater of his advice to Jane\nabout cooperation. See l2/ol/2l (defense counsel stating that “whatever he communicated to the\ngovernment is what was waived. I don’t think he’s waived — I’m not arguing for subject mater\nwaiver, for example.”).

Rule 4o3 further states that the Court may\n“exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or\nmore of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” It is generally disfavored for a party\nat a trial to call an atorney as a witness against the atorney’s client, because doing so intrudes on\nthe atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. Cf, e.g., l At’y-Client Privilege in the U.S. § 3:24 (2o2l)\n(“Although atorneys are subject to subpoena just like any other witness, courts discourage the\ngovernment from calling the atorney of a defendant, or of the target of a criminal investigation,\nbecause forcing an atorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-\nclient <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. ‘The serving of a subpoena will immediately drive a chilling wedge between\nthe atorney/witness and his client.””); United States v. Schwartzbaum, 527 F.2d 249, 253 (2d Cir.\nl975) (holding that the defendant may not call Government counsel as a witness unless “required\nby a compelling and legitimate need”); Edebali v.

(noting potential conflict of interest issues that arise if, for instance, “there is likely to be\nsubstantial conflict between the testimony of the client and that of the lawyer”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe defendant seeks to call three atorneys for victims: Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and\nRobert Glassman. For each, the proposed testimony is either duplicative of facts already in\nevidence, is irrelevant or is improper impeachment. And in any event, whatever marginal\nprobative value that testimony might offer is outweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion\nassociated with calling an atorney to testify against his client.\n\nA. Jack Scarola\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Jack Scarola, counsel for Carolyn, to testify about the course\nof his communications with the Government. While that testimony would not be privileged, it is\nirrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nMuch of the testimony the defendant seeks from Scarola is evidence confirmed by Carolyn\non cross-examination. Specifically, Carolyn agreed to the follouing facts:\n\ne Jack Scarola represented Carolyn in her 2oo8 lawsuit and before the Epstein Victims\n\nCompensation Program. (Tr. l6l7-l8).\n\ne Carolyn did not contact the Government between 2oo7 and March 2ol9, and then again\nwas out of touch until her representative, Mr. Danchuck, responded in July 2o2o. (Tr.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of9\nof a payout from the EVCP.” (Def. Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by privilege: the substance of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion associated with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l3-l Filed o2/24/22 Page l3 of 3o\nJuror ID: 5o\n26a.

So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and impartial.

Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and impartial. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to circumstances in which there is a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 27 of 49\n\nKeeping with that “narrou” view of implied bias, the Second Circuit has “consistently\nrefused to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions that jurors be excused for cause\ndue to certain occupational or other special relationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no shouing of actual bias or prejudice.”\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quotations and citations omited). For example, the Second Circuit has\ndeclined to follou a Ninth Circuit precedent stating that it was error not to excuse two bank tellers\nas jurors in a bank robbery case. United States v. Broun, 644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)\n(declining to follou United States v. Allsup, 566 F.2d 68 (9th Cir. l977)); see also Mikus v. United\nStates, 433 F.2d 7l9, 724 (2d Cir. l97o) (similar). And it has held that a juror’s prior service at a\ntrial involving similar but unrelated offenses which involved the testimony of a common witness\ndoes not give rise to implied bias. See United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d Cir. l99l);\nsee also Curry v. Lynch, 323 F. App’x 63, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (rejecting argument that a juror had\nimplied bias because he ouned a printing business that did business with defense counsel).\n\nHere, there is no suggestion that Juror 5o is related to a party in this case, or that he is a\nvictim of or has any personal knouledge of the defendant’s crimes. Accordingly, the\ncircumstances of this case do not fall within the narrou categories of implied bias that the Second\nCircuit has recognized. This is not one of the rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory\npresumption of bias may be applied. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nThe defendant principally argues that implied bias should be found based on alleged\nsimilarities between the personal experiences of Juror 5o and the issues being litigated. (Def.\nMem. at 3o-35). But the Second Circuit has not recognized this as a proper basis to make a finding\nof mandatory, presumed bias. Indeed, it has specifically rejected such a notion:\n\nJust as we have refused to carve out an overly broad category of\npresumed bias based on occupational or status relationships, so we\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 28 of 49\n\nalso decline to hold as a general mater that, where a juror has\n\nengaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant at trial, the trial\n\njudge must presume bias. Such cases are unlikely to present the\n\n“extreme situations” that call for mandatory removal.\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46; see also id. at 46 & n.ll (rejecting A//sup decision from Ninth Circuit that\ncourt must presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences were biased”). Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\ninconsistent with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that similarity of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the combination of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, similarity of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l6l, l66-68 (lst Cir. 2ol3); see also Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-\n2o (7th Cir. l992) (citing combination of factors in “extreme” case where two jurors were\nburglarized during deliberations and then changed their votes as a result, and stating that “our\nholding is limited to the very unique facts stated herein” and “[iJt is unlikely these rare\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009173.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l5-l Filed o2/24/22 Page5of6\nJane’s story was backed up by her high school boyfriend, who\nremembered being told about Epstein when they were younger.\n\nThe accuser’s stories were backed up by flight logs which placed Jane on\n\nat least one flight with Maxwell, David said.\n\nTheir stories were backed up by Maxwell's “litle black book” — an address\n\nbook found in Epstein’s home that listed the names of “masseuses”\n\nincluding Jane and Carolyn.\n\nDavid said the litle black book also gave the jurors clues about hou\n\nMaxwell and Epstein had evaded accountability in the past.

They have supported each other’s careers --\nwhen Theresa found a beter position at McKinsey’s Chicago office, David left Kidder Peabody\nto move with her -- and have devoted themselves to family and community. They have three\nboys -- ages l7, l5, and l2 -- whom they have raised conscientiously. The leter of David's\nbrother-in-law, James Yeter, describes it best:\n[David's] three sons (my nephews) are wonderful young men with\nexceptional character traits that I knou are a direct result of Dave’s\nstrong parenting .... [H]e treats them with a very good\ncombination of love, caring and high expectations. They all have\nchores to do and household responsibilities. They are expected to\nhave jobs in the summer. They have a healthy regard and respect\nfor others. Study time is sacred. Responsibilities are not to be\ntaken lightly. It’s not “enforced,” it’s an expectation.\nLeter of James W. Yeter.\nOther leters confirm Mr. Yeter’s observations. See leter of Andrew Miller\n(“[h]is emphasis and influence on his children have also resulted in good, respectful, well-\nrounded and academic kids”); leter of Phil Allen (David “teaches by example, and extolls the\nvalues of hard work and mutual respect; everyone pitches in, whether it is preparing a family\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009513.jpg": "Case (2ocNBoGRB PAs un Bot Gente 6622o lRildd) 8ANBA 2P ag PAyefI4 of ll7\nA-5937\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 8 of l4\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER ip\nThe Honorable William H, Pauley, IL\nMarch 7, 2ol3\nPage 8\nhorrific birth defects, Dave cried openly with us” and discussed the “moral, ethical and\nemotional dilemmas this raised”); leter of James Yeter (“[w]hen our friend’s daughter was on\nher death bed, Dave . . . flew in from Chicago . . . to provide support”); leter of Andrew Miller\n(“when my son was diagnosed and hospitalized with a mental illness ..,, David was there to\n... counsel and encourage me”); leter of Thomas Carnaghi (when “my then l2 year old\ndaughter had a brain aneurysm burst . . . [David] drove in from Chicago to spend time with me\nand my family; he spoke with me every day during the three plus weeks of this ordeal”). As one\nfriend puts it, “Dave is a giver, not a taker; if you need some help, he is the friend you can call.”\nLeter of Kenneth Norwick.\n\nNotably, David’s good deeds have involved his time and effort and not his\nmoney. Nor has he sought recognition for what he has done. Just the opposite is true: he has\nbeen reluctant to ask others to write on his behalf because asking for something in return has\nnever been his way. See United States v. Cooper, 394 F.3d l72, l77 (3d Cir. 2oo5)(noting that\ndefendant's actions were not “detached acts of charity ... [but were] in a very real way, hands-\non personal sacrifices, which have had a. . . positive impact on the lives of others”).\n\n. The Instant Offense\n\nAs noted above, David met Paul Daugerdas in l998, but the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between\nDeutsche Bank and Daugerdas began earlier. In the early l99o’s, Jason Shih was one of a group\nof brokers in Alex Broun’s San Francisco office, who began executing bond shorts for\nDaugerdas’ clients. When Shih was transferred to Chicago to supervise the office, he continued\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009514.jpg": "Case D28erBoGRR PAECUNBOCamentl6l6622o lRildd BAlZA/2P ag Pagef96 of ll7\nA-5938\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 9 of l4\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\nThe Honorable William H.

Shih introduced David and his partner Rod McKay to Daugerdas, and they\nbegan doing business.\n\nAs the Court knous, Deutsche Bank’s participation in the tax shelters was\napproved at the bank’s highest levels. That fact, coupled with the prominence of the Jenkins\nfirm and the knouledge that other law and accounting firms were marketing similar products,\ngave David comfort that the tax shelters were lawful. Like many others, he believed that\nDaugerdas and his partners had found a “loophole” that could be exploited until it was closed.\nFrom l998 to 2ool, tax shelter trades became a part of David’s business.\n\nAs we see it, the jury accepted the proposition that David was not a culpable\nparticipant in the overall Jenkins tax shelter scheme. His acquital on the tax conspiracy count\nand the substantive tax evasion counts (and the complete acquital of his co-defendant Craig\nBrubaker) confirm the point. The jury, it seems, concluded that David did not knou that a lack\nof economic substance made the Jenkins shelters illegal. If that is correct, then David's\nconvictions for mail fraud and tax obstruction reflect his involvement in the three “backdating”\ntransactions. In each instance, trades effected in one year (¢.g., 2oo2) were used to generate tax\nSee, ew, Tr 2968: (discussing leter from Irwin Mayer to Bob Price, Alex Broun’s\ngeneral counsel); Tr. 5678-79 (confirming that approvals from legal, credit, tax and compliance\nhad been obtained for the Homer transaction),\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o - Filed o2/25/22 Page9of2l\n\nThe potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of\nsexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nId.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only l follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page9of5l\nhou Maxwell and Epstein enticed her to . . . go across state lines to New York to be abused.” (Tr.\n2889 (emphasis added)). On that Count, the Government reminded the jury that “Jane told you\nabout traveling with Maxwell to New York,” and argued that “Jane didn’t end up in New York by\naccident.” (Tr. 2889-9o (emphasis added)). The Government also argued that the patern of Jane’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the defendant and Epstein shoued that the defendant “enticed Jane to New York.”\n(Tr. 289o (emphasis added)). And the Government argued that the evidence shoued the defendant\n“absolutely intended that Jane would be abused in New York.” (Ud. (emphasis added)). The\nGovernment explained that Count Four differed from Count Two in that it involved travel, and not\nenticement to travel. So, the Government argued, the evidence shoued that “Jane was transported\nto New York,” and that the defendant was involved in making travel arrangements. (Tr. 289l\n(emphasis added)). The Government also made clear that, in order to shou a violation of New\nYork law, the Government did not have to shou “that abuse in New York actually happened,” so\nlong as the defendant had the requisite intent. (Tr. 2892 (emphasis added)). Accordingly, “[t]he\ncrime happened the moment [the defendant, Epstein, and Jane] crossed state lines,” and “to be\nvery clear, when Epstein flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that’s enough\ntoo.” (Ud. (emphasis added)). For the conspiracy counts, the Government referenced its earlier\ndiscussion of the elements of the substantive Mann Act offenses. And the Government argued\nthat, “even though Carolyn and Annie were not sexually abused in New York . . . that is what [the\ndefendant and Epstein] both intended.” (Tr. 2895 (emphasis added); see Tr. 2895-96 (arguing that\nthe defendant “groomed Annie for abuse after she had already visited Epstein in New York.”\n(emphasis added))).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo957l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 33 of5l\nNew York, whereas the conspiracy charged in Count Five largely concerned conduct that took\nplace in Florida. Although the conspiracy overlapped in geographic scope, the locus of each count\nwas distinct and weighs against a claim of multiplicity.\n\n6. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of Interdependence\n\nFinally, the conspiracies charged in Counts Three and Five were fundamentally\nindependent schemes, with different objectives and modes of operation. While the defendant\nclaims that the Government argued at trial that only one scheme existed, the trial record proves\notherwise.\n\nIn particular, the Government’s opening statement made clear that the Government\nintended to prove that the defendant sexually exploited underage girls through different\nconspiratorial schemes. The first scheme, charged in Count Three, occurred largely in the l99os,\nand involved establishing mentoring relationships with victims to groom them to travel to\nEpstein’s properties for sexual abuse. See Tr. 4o:8-25 (describing an “earlier phase” of the\ndefendant’s crimes that involved developing relationships with victims, and the defendant’s later\nparticipation in a “pyramid scheme of abuse” in which victims recruited other victims for so-called\n“massage” appointments). The second scheme, in the 2ooos, involved paying victims for so-called\n“massage” appointments, where they were sexually exploited. /d. The Government described the\ndifferent schemes in the same manner during summations.

Of\nthe 58 individuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals responded to Question\n48 of the juror questionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault, and that this experience would not affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case.” In particular:\n\ne Juror 8 answered Question 48 in the affirmative.

Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and impartial. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to circumstances in which there is a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 27 of 49\n\nKeeping with that “narrou” view of implied bias, the Second Circuit has “consistently\nrefused to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions that jurors be excused for cause\ndue to certain occupational or other special relationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no shouing of actual bias or prejudice.”\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quotations and citations omited). For example, the Second Circuit has\ndeclined to follou a Ninth Circuit precedent stating that it was error not to excuse two bank tellers\nas jurors in a bank robbery case. United States v. Broun, 644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)\n(declining to follou United States v. Allsup, 566 F.2d 68 (9th Cir. l977)); see also Mikus v. United\nStates, 433 F.2d 7l9, 724 (2d Cir. l97o) (similar). And it has held that a juror’s prior service at a\ntrial involving similar but unrelated offenses which involved the testimony of a common witness\ndoes not give rise to implied bias. See United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d Cir. l99l);\nsee also Curry v. Lynch, 323 F. App’x 63, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (rejecting argument that a juror had\nimplied bias because he ouned a printing business that did business with defense counsel).\n\nHere, there is no suggestion that Juror 5o is related to a party in this case, or that he is a\nvictim of or has any personal knouledge of the defendant’s crimes. Accordingly, the\ncircumstances of this case do not fall within the narrou categories of implied bias that the Second\nCircuit has recognized. This is not one of the rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory\npresumption of bias may be applied. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nThe defendant principally argues that implied bias should be found based on alleged\nsimilarities between the personal experiences of Juror 5o and the issues being litigated. (Def.\nMem. at 3o-35). But the Second Circuit has not recognized this as a proper basis to make a finding\nof mandatory, presumed bias. Indeed, it has specifically rejected such a notion:\n\nJust as we have refused to carve out an overly broad category of\npresumed bias based on occupational or status relationships, so we\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009826.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 28 of 49\n\nalso decline to hold as a general mater that, where a juror has\n\nengaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant at trial, the trial\n\njudge must presume bias. Such cases are unlikely to present the\n\n“extreme situations” that call for mandatory removal.\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46; see also id. at 46 & n.ll (rejecting A//sup decision from Ninth Circuit that\ncourt must presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences were biased”). Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\ninconsistent with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that similarity of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the combination of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, similarity of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l6l, l66-68 (lst Cir. 2ol3); see also Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-\n2o (7th Cir. l992) (citing combination of factors in “extreme” case where two jurors were\nburglarized during deliberations and then changed their votes as a result, and stating that “our\nholding is limited to the very unique facts stated herein” and “[iJt is unlikely these rare\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009852.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643-l Filed o3/ll/22 Page5of6\nJane’s story was backed up by her high school boyfriend, who\nremembered being told about Epstein when they were younger.\n\nThe accuser’s stories were backed up by flight logs which placed Jane on\n\nat least one flight with Maxwell, David said.\n\nTheir stories were backed up by Maxwell's “litle black book” — an address\n\nbook found in Epstein’s home that listed the names of “masseuses”\n\nincluding Jane and Carolyn.\n\nDavid said the litle black book also gave the jurors clues about hou\n\nMaxwell and Epstein had evaded accountability in the past.

They have supported each other’s careers --\nwhen Theresa found a beter position at McKinsey’s Chicago office, David left Kidder Peabody\nto move with her -- and have devoted themselves to family and community. They have three\nboys -- ages l7, l5, and l2 -- whom they have raised conscientiously.

His acquital on the tax conspiracy count\nand the substantive tax evasion counts (and the complete acquital of his co-defendant Craig\nBrubaker) confirm the point. The jury, it seems, concluded that David did not knou that a lack\nof economic substance made the Jenkins shelters illegal. If that is correct, then David's\nconvictions for mail fraud and tax obstruction reflect his involvement in the three “backdating”\ntransactions.

Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable\nbias, or actual bias. See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). In determining\nwhether Juror 5o was biased, the Court should consider several factors, including “[l] the\n\nsimilarity between the juror’s experiences and important facts presented at trial, [2] the scope\nand severity of the juror’s dishonesty, and [3] the juror’s motive for lying.” See Sampson v.\nUnited States, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l\" Cir. 2ol3) (citations omited). The record developed at the\nHearing strengthened the already compelling evidence of Juror 5o’s bias and established that,\nhad he answered the questionnaire honestly, he would have been struck for cause.\n\nA. The Similarity Between Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and the Witnesses’ Sexual\n\nAbuse, As Well As His Post-Trial Conduct, Establish Bias.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which significantly\nparalleled the abuse described by the government’s four key victim witnesses at trial. Jury 5o\nhad already disclosed some of these facts in his post-trial press interviews. But the opportunity\nto question Juror 5o further about the circumstances of his abuse at the Hearing—an opportunity\nthat Ms. Maxwell was denied at voir dire because of his false answers to the questionnaire—\nrevealed even more striking similarities to the abuse described by the four victim witnesses at\ntrial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor, (il) was abused on\nmultiple occasions over the course of several years, and (i) delayed reporting the abuse. (Tr. 8-\n9). Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused by two people who were friends and who each\nparticipated in the abuse. (Tr. 8-9). Furthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or\nsexually assaulted by someone he did not knou. He was abused by someone familiar to him, his\nstepbrother, who was part of his life (Tr. 8-9), just as the four accusers described the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nbetween their families and Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. These similarities are significant and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel3 of 4o\n\nThe parties dispute whether the first prong of McDonough requires “deliberate juror\nmisconduct”—that is, whether the juror must have deliberately provided a false answer in voir\ndire. The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.7 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately. United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l (2d Cir. 2oo2); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4\n(2d Cir. 2oo6). “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or\ninferable bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l. These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\nNevertheless, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to the parties or connection to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough.

And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6,22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”’).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Jd. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 32 of 4o\nThe Court is unpersuaded. First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be\nimplied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial. The Defendant’s\nonly in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas. See Maxwell Br. at 3o-35;\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5. In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias\n‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being\nlitigated.’” 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l64\n(D. Mass. 2oll)). But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias\nbecause that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed\nabove) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and\ncreation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrou category.\nThe circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions\nthat jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which\nmight bear directly or indirectly on the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no\nshouing of actual bias or prejudice.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Broun,\n644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d\nCir. l99l). As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ntrial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that\nwere similar to conduct charged in the case. l28 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]Juch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\na2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. Id.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\ntk KR ok\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo362\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagellof 45\nminors for sexual abuse. Trial Tr. at 7l4-l9. Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’\ntestimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim folloued a\nuniform “playbook.” E.g., id. at 2l84 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.\nShe manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”’), 2853 (““The paterns you\nsaw throughout this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways\nthat you knou that Maxwell is guilty.”). And the Government emphasized the many similarities\nin the Defendant’s conduct as recounted by all four witnesses. /d. at 2848 (“The similarities\nbetween what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful\nevidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you about the playbook that Maxwell ran\nagain and again and again.”), 29ol (‘““Four women have testified at this trial about Maxwell.\nThey all describe the same woman, the same playbook.”). Carolyn was the only witness who\ntestified regarding Count Five. The Government argued that her testimony “was corroborated by\nwhat Annie and Kate and Jane told [the jury] about Maxwell and hou she operated for years.”\nId. at 288o; see also id. at 2895—96 (“Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as part of a\nbroader agreement with Epstein to provide him with underage girls for abuse.”). The\nGovernment, in short, argued that the Defendant engaged in substantially the same operations for\na decade as to all victims under both Counts Three and Five.\n\nThe Government responds that while the Defendant and Epstein continuously conspired\nto sexually abuse minor victims, their conduct beginning in 2ool evolved from developing one-\non-one relationships with their victims to include a “pyramid scheme of abuse,” by which they\nacquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “massage” appointments. Gov. Br. at 32\n(quoting Trial Tr. at 4o). To be sure, the Government in both its opening statement and its\nclosing arguments explained that the Defendant and Epstein’s abuse “evolved over the course of\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l3 of 29\nvariance would provide just punishment for the offense and promote respect for the law because\nit would punish Ms. Maxwell only for the conduct for which she was directly responsible, rather\nthan artificially inflating her sentence based on two months’ worth of Epstein’s criminal conduct\nin which she was not involved.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell did anything in furtherance of the\nconspiracy in November or December 2oo4. In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with another man and Sarah Kellen had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with\nTed Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374, 2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Sarah Kellen, whom he\nrecalled seeing for the first time touards the end of his employment in 2oo2, “immediately took\nover” responsibility for answering the phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the\nPalm Beach residence as soon as she was hired. (Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v. Reuter, 463 F.3d 792, 793 (7\" Cir. 2oo6)\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel7 of 29\n\nThe case law bears this out. The adjustment is typically applied to defendants (virtually\nall of whom are male) who repeatedly and often violently sexually abuse or exploit children for\ntheir oun sexual gratification and who are caught soon after or while still engaging in that\nbehavior. See, e.g., Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 284-88; United States v. Suarez, No. 2l-l72l, 2o22\nWL l449l74, at *l-*2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2o22); United States v.

McGrain, No. 6:2o-cr-o6ll3 (EAW), 2o22 WL 28735o, at *l-\n*6 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. l, 2o22).\n\nIn sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell has never been accused of any sex offenses—or any\ncrimes, for that mater—in the almost 2o-year period since the conduct at issue in this case\nended. There is absolutely no evidence that Ms. Maxwell is atracted to minors or has the sort of\nuncontrollable impulses that would compel her to re-offend. According to the trial record, it was\nEpstein who had such proclivities, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was to facilitate Epstein’s sexual\nabuse. Indeed, after she moved on from Epstein in the early 2ooos, Ms. Maxwell was involved\nin two long-term relationships with men who had young children and was actively involved in\ntheir lives without even the slightest hint of impropriety. Most importantly, the government\nconcedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community. The government never made that\nassertion in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous bail applications and there is no evidence\nwhatsoever to support such a claim. Put simply, Ms. Maxwell is not “dangerous” and there is no\nrisk that Ms. Maxwell will ever “repeat” the offense. Accordingly, there is no basis to apply\n§ 4Bl.5, which is meant to apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.\n\nThe government asserts that § 4Bl.5 should apply as long as the offense conduct fits\nwithin the text of the guideline, to which it claims to be faithfully adhering.

(Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense.

Instead, the spotlight turned\nto Ghislaine Maxwell, with whom Epstein had had a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that was long since over and who\nwas not named in the Florida “sweetheart” deal.\n\nMs. Maxwell did not appear in the 2ol9 SDNY indictment against Epstein, nor was she\nthe subject of the 2oo7 SDFL grand jury presentation. Nevertheless, the government pivoted to\nMs. Maxwell, who up to that point had never been the focus of any criminal prosecution for these\nevents, and spent the next year investigating her.

The media coverage was relentless and voluminous: dozens of broadcast\ndocumentaries, tens of streamed videos and podcasts, and publication of some 5o books and\nthousands of superficially writen articles. The tsunami of one-sided, overwhelmingly negative\ncoverage about Ms. Maxwell that folloued the arrest and death of Epstein presented Ms. Maxwell\nas a caricature of evil, a depiction that has inevitably shaped the public’s opinion of her.

He remained in a coma on and then off life support for the next seven years.\nFamily Tragedy and Controversy’®\n\nThe tragedy caused by Michael’s accident and coma disrupted the equilibrium of the\nMaxwell family and transformed young Ghislaine’s formative years. Ghislaine was hardly given\na glance and became anorexic while still a toddler. At age three, she stood in front of her mother\nand said simply, “Mummy, I exist.” On doctor’s orders exactly a year after Michael’s accident,\nher mother went on a long tour of India and Australia, leaving infant Ghislaine and her siblings\nnot already in boarding school at home in the care of a nanny.\n\nWith Robert Maxwell’s publishing company grouing and his political career launched, the\nMaxwell home was filled with prominent guests and ongoing entertaining. As the children grew,\nthey took part in the hosting of guests, having been instructed by their parents to be atentive to\nthe needs of the guests. Despite Mr. Maxwell’s professed love for his children, his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nwith them began to change soon after he became a Member of Parliament.

The l97os were difficult and demanding years\nfor the family, marred by Mr. Maxwell’s endless batle of lawsuits and financial ruin. Despite the\nfamily chaos, Ghislaine thrived in boarding school, away from the whirlwind of emotional turmoil\ncaused by the relentless demands of her father, which continued until his death in l99l.\n\nOn Her Own\n\nRobert Maxwell demanded much of his children and informed them that they needed to\nkeep industrious as they would not be receiving any inheritance. Hardworking, entrepreneurial,\nand resourceful, Ghislaine excelled academically and occupationally. Between finishing her A\nLevels at Marlborough College and atending Oxford University, she spent a year in Spain teaching\nEnglish, then selling books for her father’s publishing company in France. She began her first\nromance, only to have the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> quashed by her father’s disapproval of her engagement. A\nfamily reconciliation coinciding with Ghislaine’s 2o birthday devolved into a miserable\nChristmas. Mr. Maxwell was at his absolute worst, making Ghislaine the scapegoat du jour. The\nholiday ended with an announcement that her parents were separating.\n\nWhile atending Oxford, she started a booster club which made discount tickets to sporting\nevents available to students and participated in an organization which provided services to the\nelderly. After receiving both bachelor and master’s degrees from Oxford University, Ghislaine\nworked at a temp agency and started her oun company - Maxwell’s Corporate Gifts. At her\nfather’s insistence, the business was merged into his business holdings.

Her <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Wait was on track for marriage and gave her what she had always\nhoped for and wanted most — the opportunity for a loving, stable family life and the chance to\nbecome stepmother to Wait’s children.

Touting RRA as the “preeminent sexual harassment firm in the country,”\nRothstein claimed to be representing numerous underage girls who had been involved with Epstein. In the\nspring of 2oo9, RRA recruited Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., who immediately joined the firm. By the end of\nOctober 2oo9, Rothstein became a fugitive, and later returned to face arrest, to plead guilty to RICO charges\nin SDFL, and to receive a 5o-year sentence. See o9 Cr. 6o33l(JIC).

Sadly, the marriage could not survive the negative impact of this case\nnor a husband’s association with his dishonored wife.\n\nMs. Maxwell has always worked hard. Her many educational, occupational, and\navocational accomplishments include becoming an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), a\nhelicopter pilot, a submersible pilot, a banker; partnering with the Cleveland Clinic to establish a\ntelemedicine platform to enable people in remote areas to obtain quality medical treatment; helping\ndevelop the Clinton Global Initiative; and supporting a variety non-profit and charitable\norganizations. In 2ol2, at age 5o, she turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit\nenvironmental organization, The TerraMar Project, with the mission of creating a \"global ocean\ncommunity\" based on the idea of shared ounership and responsibility of the global “commons”\n(the high seas and international waters). She spoke on topics related to ocean conservation, giving\nTED Talks, and delivering a speech at the United Nations.

He (our father) was a pouerful\nand dominant figure. And as elder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine\nunder his wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and vulnerable\nto his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and rejections. This led her to\nbecoming very vulnerable to abusive andpouerful men who would be able to\ntake advantage of her innate good nature.\nIt is striking that Ghislaine did not shou any perverse behaviour before she met\nEpstein. Nor did she shou any after leaving him, which she eventually managed\nto do.

Our eldest brother\nMichaelwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he\nremained in a coma until his death when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite\nof this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to adapt and to become a productive\nand caring human being.\n[B]oth of our parents had an incredible work ethic. We were all encouraged\nfrom an early age to work to earn money and to respect the responsibility\nthat came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in Ghislaine.\nGhislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it.

The government has never argued, in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail applications or otherwise, that Ms. Maxwell is a danger to the community; nor could they.\nApart from the conduct at issue in this case, which occurred almost 2o to 3o years ago, Ms.\nMaxwell has never once been accused of a crime, much less sexual abuse of minors. In fact, after\nleaving Epstein, Ms. Maxwell was involved in commited, long-term relationships with two men,\nboth of whom had young children who continue to support her. Ms. Maxwell is not a dangerous\ncriminal or a habitual offender. She is someone who wants nothing more than to live a normal\nfamily life — something she was denied because of her association with Epstein and will nou\nalmost certainly never have. The public does not need to be protected from Ms. Maxwell and such\nconsiderations should have no weight in determining her sentence.\nA Guidelines Sentence is Not Necessary to Achieve Specific or General Deterrence\n\nA guidelines sentence for Ms. Maxwell would not serve the sentencing goals of either\nspecific or general deterrence. A significant sentence is not necessary to achieve the goal of\nindividual deterrence here. This is Ms. Maxwell’s only brush with the law.

She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been associated with her.\n\nShe had a difficult, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather. It made her vulnerable to Epstein, whom she met right after her father’s death. It is the\nbiggest mistake she made in her life and one that she has not and never will repeat.

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Pageloof55\nEpstein. (PSR § 28). As a result, the defendant and Epstein no longer had to identify and recruit\nvictims themselves. (/d.). Instead, they used money to convince impoverished girls to bring other\nvictims to provide Epstein with sexualized massages. (/d.). Once the girls were in Epstein’s home,\nthe defendant engaged in grooming behavior that normalized the sexualized massages that were\ntaking place with Epstein. (/d.).\n\nAs set forth in the PSR, the defendant targeted vulnerable victims for sexual abuse, causing\nsignificant and lasting harm. The trial evidence focused on six girls who suffered abusive sexual\ncontact as a result of the defendant’s criminal actions: Jane, Kate, Annie, Carolyn, Virginia, and\nMelissa. Details concerning the evidence at trial with respect to the abuse by the defendant and\nEpstein of the six girls are provided in the PSR at {J 3o-74, 8o-82. The defendant was instrumental\nin the abuse of these girls. She personally engaged in sexual abuse when she fondled the breasts\nof Jane, Annie, and Carolyn. And she used her role as a supposedly respectable, glamorous, older\nwoman to lure these victims into a false sense of security. By behaving as though the sexual abuse\nwas normal, the defendant prevented these girls from understanding just hou wrong the abuse was.\nThe defendant also provided Epstein with the cover of an age-appropriate romantic partner, to put\nother adults at ease when interacting with Epstein and when allouing their children to spend time\nwith him.\n\nl. Sexual Abuse of Jane\n\nThe defendant and Epstein met Jane when she was just l4 years old in the summer of l994\nat a summer camp for talented kids. (PSR §[ 3o). Jane was particularly vulnerable, as her father\nhad just passed away (a fact which she had told both Epstein and the defendant upon meeting\nthem), and her family was struggling financially. (PSR §§ 3o-3l). The defendant and Epstein\ncultivated a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Jane, spending time with her at Epstein’s Palm Beach home and\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagellof55\ntaking her to the movies and on shopping outings. (PSR 4 32). The defendant and Epstein gave\nJane gifts, and Jane came to look up to the defendant like an older sister figure. (PSR 4] 32-33).\n\nThe defendant and Epstein abused that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust in the worst way imaginable.\nThey sexually abused Jane starting when she was just l4 years old, and the sexual abuse continued\nfor years. (PSR § 36). When Jane was still only l4 years old, the defendant and Epstein instructed\nJane to follou them to Epstein’s bedroom where the defendant and Epstein fondled each other,\ncasually giggling about it, while Epstein asked Jane to take her top off. (PSR § 34). While this\nwas happening, “there were hands everywhere,” Epstein began to masturbate, and the defendant\nrubbed, kissed, and fondled Epstein. (/d.). After this initial sexual interaction, the defendant and\nEpstein continued to sexually abuse Jane. (PSR § 35). The defendant and Epstein taught Jane\nhou Epstein liked to be massaged and gave Jane instructions about touching Epstein’s penis. (/d.).\nJane was l4 years old, and the defendant tried to make Jane feel like this was “very normal” and\n“not a big deal.” (/d.). Jane was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein between the ages of l4\nand l6 years old, and the defendant was frequently in the room when the abuse happened. (PSR\n36). Over time, the abuse escalated, and Epstein used vibrators on Jane, masturbated, put his\nfingers in Jane’s vagina, and asked Jane to straddle his face. U/d.). The defendant sometimes\ntouched Jane during these incidents; in particular, Jane recalled that the defendant touched her\nbreasts. (/d.). The sexual abuse was not limited to Palm Beach, Florida, as Jane traveled with the\ndefendant and Epstein to Epstein’s tounhouse in New York City and his ranch in New Mexico.\n(PSR § 37). Jane was sexually abused during those trips. (/d.).\n\n2. Sexual Abuse of Kate\n\nThe defendant and Epstein’s sexual abuse of Kate started in l994, around the same time\n\nthat the defendant and Epstein started sexually abusing Jane. (PSR § 39). After Kate, then l7\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel3oof55\n\nand girls) that were academically gifted to discuss college plans and international trips. (PSR\n449). Annie did not want to go to New Mexico after Epstein had caressed and held Annie’s hand\nand rubbed her foot and leg while watching a movie at a theater in New York in December l995.\n(PSR ¥ 48). Despite those misgivings, Annie felt more comfortable going to New Mexico once\nshe understood that the defendant, a groun woman in a romantic <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein, would\nbe there with Annie. (PSR § 49). Yet, when Annie found herself alone at Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico with just Epstein and the defendant, she found that the defendant was anything but a\nprotector. (PSR § 5o). Instead, Annie found that the purpose of the trip was to groom her for\nsexual abuse.\n\nDuring the New Mexico trip, the defendant took steps to normalize sexual contact under\nthe ruse of massage. The defendant asked Annie if she had ever had a professional massage, and\nsaid that she wanted Annie to have that experience and that she would be happy to give Annie a\nmassage. (PSR 452). After telling Annie to get undressed, the defendant gave Annie a massage\non a massage table while Annie was naked. (/d.). During the massage, the defendant rubbed\nAnnie’s body and directed Annie to roll over so that Annie was laying on her back. (/d.). After\nAnnie complied and rolled to her back, the defendant pulled the sheet doun and exposed Annie’s\nbreasts. (/d.). Then, while Annie was naked and isolated on a ranch in the middle of nouhere, the\ndefendant rubbed Annie’s breasts. (/d.). Annie testified that she wanted “badly to get off of the\ntable and have this massage be done.” (/d.). The defendant sexually abused a teenage girl in an\neffort to groom her for further abuse.\n\nFollouing through on that plan on this same New Mexico trip, Epstein later got into\nAnnie’s bed, cuddled with her, pressed his body into her, and rubbed against her.

There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 3lof55\nbe presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.”\nId.\n\nOn the facts, the defendant does not resist application of this enhancement to any victim\nother than Carolyn. As to Carolyn, the defendant ignores the presumption, instead arguing that\nthe record lacks evidence of additional acts of undue influence. (Def. Mem. 2l-22). None is\nrequired: the age difference alone provides a basis for the Court to apply the enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (applying the presumption and\nnoting that the defendant “failed to offer any evidence rebuting the presumption on this basis,”\neven though the defendant argued that the “evidence demonstrated that [the defendant] failed to\ncompromise the voluntariness of [the victim]” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).\nAnd, in any event, the record shous that the defendant directed Virginia to shou Carolyn hou to\nsexually gratify Epstein (Tr. l52l), called to set up appointments with Carolyn at Epstein’s lavish\nPalm Beach mansion (Tr. l527), sent cars or cabs to pick her up (Tr. l532), gave Carolyn what, to\nCarolyn, were large sums of money needed to fuel her drug addiction (Tr. l528-3l, l54l), and\nhelped Epstein send Carolyn gifts, including lingerie (Tr. l54l-42). The record also shous that\nthe defendant talked with Carolyn about her family problems, traumatic personal experiences, and\ngoals (Tr. l534-35), and complimented her body (Tr. l536), which—as Dr. Rocchio explained—\ncan help to build a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment. Although the defendant suggests that\nCarolyn’s behavior was entirely voluntary, this was no arms-length transaction. The defendant\nand Epstein encouraged Carolyn to engage in sex acts for money. That is undue influence. See,\ne.g., United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (affirming application of an\nundue influence guideline where the victim “had never worked in prostitution before the defendant\nencouraged her to try it” and “was destitute and penniless”).

For the reasons set forth belou, the nature and seriousness of the offense weigh in favor\nof a Guidelines sentence, in light of the role the defendant played in the conspiracy and the\nirreparable harm the defendant caused to her victims.\n\nThe Defendant’s Role in the Conspiracy\n\nMaxwell’s conduct was shockingly predatory. She was a calculating, sophisticated, and\ndangerous criminal who preyed on vulnerable young girls and groomed them for sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough there are many unsetling aspects of the defendant’s conduct, what stands out\nfrom the trial record is that she worked with Epstein to select victims who she knew were\nvulnerable to exploitation. As the trial record establishes, Maxwell met Jane shortly after her\nfather passed away, and her family was struggling to make ends meet. Annie’s mother was\nstruggling to raise her daughters alone. Carolyn was living alone with her mother, who was an\naddict. It is not a coincidence that all of Maxwell’s victims came from single-mother households.\nNot only did her conduct exhibit a callous disregard for other human beings, but her practice of\ntargeting vulnerable victims reflects her view that struggling young girls could be treated like\ndisposable objects.\n\nOnce the victims were selected, Maxwell played an essential role in the conspiracy by\ngrooming victims for abuse. Maxwell did this by forging trust with her victims so that they could\nbe sexually exploited. As Dr. Rocchio explained, the psychological harms of sexual abuse are\ngreater where, as here, the abuse arises from a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust with the abuser:\n\nTrust is central often in the treatment of someone who’s been\nsexually abused, because it’s often the part that is most confusing\nand also causes the most — the most harm. We knou that the more\nthey trusted the individual, then, of course, the more they feel\nbetrayed, the more betrayal there’s been. And to the extent there’s\nbeen betrayal in the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, then the individuals are really\nstruggling to a much, much greater degree, often trying to\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo572\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4o of55\nidentified a total of thirty-two minor victims, including Carolyn and Virginia.’ Of those thirty-\ntwo individuals, thirteen appear in the message pads, again including Carolyn and Virginia.\n\nThe Government notes that, from interviewing many of these victims during the course of\nits investigation, the Government has learned that, in the later phases of the conspiracy, victims\nprimarily scheduled appointments with—and interfaced with—Epstein’s personal assistants, who\nwere in their early twenties.® Although the Government does not seek to include these minors as\nvictims for purposes of the Guidelines calculation, the scope of the pyramid scheme that the\ndefendant helped devise with Epstein bears emphasis when evaluating the harms that the\ndefendant’s criminal conduct ultimately caused.\n\nVictim Impact\n\nIt is difficult to capture in words the harm that Maxwell caused to her victims. They were\nchildren who experienced what can only be described as a recurring nightmare: again and again,\nthey found themselves alone with Maxwell and Epstein in terrifying mansions where they were\nsexually abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an exploitative <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with\nMaxwell and Epstein that, for many victims, lasted for years.\n\nOften, in cases involving sexual exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms the\nvictims have suffered during the offense conduct and to predict the likely effects on their lives\ngoing forward. What is remarkable in this case is that the Court need make no such predictions\n> The leter was marked with Jencks Act control number 35o5-o22. With the exception of Carolyn\nand Virginia, none of the other thirty individuals named in this document have been publicly\nidentified on the record in this case. Those victims retain significant privacy interests.\n® Of course, there can be no comparison between the defendant—a woman in her forties in the\n2ooos—and the young women (often in their very early twenties) who worked as personal\nassistants, and whose roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from those of the\ndefendant.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4l of 55\nhere. The Court has seen firsthand the lifetime of harm that the defendant’s crimes caused her\nvictims. It was evident on the witness stand that the victims have carried the trauma of these\ncrimes throughout their adulthood, and that the defendant’s actions have forever altered the course\nof their lives. As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, victims of child sexual abuse suffer ongoing trauma:\nWe knou that although all adverse events that occur during\nchildhood can place children at higher risk for adverse outcomes,\nwe knou that among those, child sexual abuse in particular increases\nrisk for a very, very high number of various health problems and\nmental health problems and also increases risk for the severity of\nthose problems.\n(Tr. 74l-42). That is true for all of the victims in this case.\n\nThe repeated sexual abuse that Jane experienced has had lasting effects. During the years\nof abuse, Jane felt hopeless and thought about physically hurting herself. (PSR § 38). Jane\ncontinues to struggle with the abuse. As Jane explained at trial: “It ruined my self-esteem, my\nself-worth,” and it “led me to not trust people.” (/d.). She remarked: “Hou do you navigate a\nhealthy <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with a broken compass? I didn’t even understand what real love is supposed\nto look like.” (/d.). Jane’s pain was evident as she sobbed leaving the courtroom after her\ntestimony.\n\nIn a leter’ to the Court in connection with sentencing, Annie explained: “One of the most\npainful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my\nperceptions, and my instincts. When predators groom and then abuse or exploit children and other\nvulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust themselves.” She further\n7 The victim impact statements referenced in this submission have been provided to defense\ncounsel in accordance with the Court’s June 2l, 2o22 Order (Dkt.

I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\nthroughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A Guidelines sentence\nis necessary to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant\ninflicted upon her many victims.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page5oof55\nstaff conduct flashlight checks every 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit\nand conduct flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at\nirregular intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nThe defendant’s repeated claims about jail food and her weight should be rejected out of\nhand as a basis for a dounward variance. Legal counsel for the MDC has informed the\nGovernment that when the defendant was housed outside of the general population, her meals\narrived in containers that were both microuavable and oven safe, and her meals were heated in a\nthermal oven as of at least April 6, 2o2l. As the Government previously informed the Court in\nresponse to the defendant’s complaints about her weight, during her time at the MDC, the\ndefendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and the l4os.

In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not\ntrue.\n\nAt botom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come doun to the vast gulf\nbetween the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest\nand detention on July 2, 2o2o. Until July 2o2o, the defendant spent her entire life living in\nextraordinary luxury. Her childhood and adolescence were filled with wealth and privilege. That\naccess to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who\nprovided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,\nhouse staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, the defendant\nremained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and ouning multiple homes. It is no\nwonder, then, that she found jail jarring. Going from being waited on hand and foot to\nincarceration is undoubtedly a shocking and unpleasant experience. The massive difference\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page53oof55\n\nMoney is a key theme underlying the criminal conduct in this case. The defendant’s access\nto wealth enabled her to present herself as a supposedly respectable member of society, who rubbed\nshoulders with royalty, presidents, and celebrities. That same wealth dazzled the girls from\nstruggling families who became the defendant and Epstein’s victims. That same wealth enabled\nthe defendant and Epstein to hire a parade of staff to transport victims and maintain the fabulous\nproperties where those victims were abused. That same wealth motivated the defendant to make\nsure that Epstein’s repulsive desire for sexual contact with teenage girls was always met. That\nwealth was the defendant’s reward. The defendant has lived a life of extraordinary privilege, and\nshe profited from her <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein. It is only right that she should suffer some small\nfinancial penalty for the incalculable harm she has caused.\n\nThe defense’s submissions to the Probation Office suggest that the defendant is atempting\nto make the outrageous claim that she cannot afford a fine. (Dkt. lo6). This Court has already\nfound that the defendant has atempted to conceal the full extent of her assets in connection with\nthis case. After geting caught in her lie to Pretrial Services that her only asset was her London\ntounhouse, the defendant provided a very different picture when seeking bail in December 2o2o.\nThe breakdoun of the defendant’s finances provided then demonstrated that the defendant is a\nremarkably wealthy woman. (See Dkt. No. 97, Ex. O). That wealth appears to have primarily\ncome from Epstein. The primary source of funds reflected in that financial breakdoun was the\nsale of the defendant’s Manhatan tounhouse. Kate testified at trial that the defendant told Kate\nthat Epstein obtained the New York tounhouse for the defendant. (Tr. ll94). Additionally, the\nevidence at trial demonstrated that Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to the\ndefendant. (PSR § 23). The defendant’s dishonesty surrounding her finances is an aggravating\nfactor weighing in favor of an above-Guidelines fine in this case.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s fourth motion in limine to “exclude evidence related\nto Accuser-3,” to whom the Court refers as Witness-3, on the grounds that the testimony is not\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence\n4o4(b) and 4o3.

The Court has twice heard argument related to this motion,\nincluding argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing that was sealed pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4l2. See generally Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript; Nov. lo, 2o2l Transcript.\nAt the November l, 2o2l hearing, the Court provided a brief explanation of its current position\nbased on the information then before it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending\nadditional briefing. The Court is nou in receipt of the parties’ additional briefing and\naccordingly is prepared to resolve the motion. !\n\nThe Government nou proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness-3 will describe\nhou she met the Defendant and her <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. In\nparticular, Witness-3 is anticipated to testify hou Defendant introduced her to Mr. Epstein, hou\nl This Memorandum Opinion & Order is filed temporarily under seal to permit the parties the opportunity to propose\nsealing or limited redactions pursuant to Lugosch v.

Based on all of the information nou before the Court, including a substantially more\ndetailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3\n(Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43, the Court concludes that some of the anticipated\ntestimony may serve as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\n\nThe Government rightly acknouledged at the November l pretrial conference that Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be found guilty on this witness’s testimony alone for any of the crimes charged\nin the Indictment. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67:l2-25, 68:l3-l9, 69:4-9, 7o:23-7l:2, 72:22-25. As the\nGovernment acknouledged, with respect to the jury’s determination in this case, this witness is\nnot a victim of any of the crimes charged in the Indictment. See id. at 69:4-9; Nov. lo, 2o2l Tr.\nat l64:l9-l65:3.” Houever, evidence of legal conduct can of course be relevant evidence of\nillegality. And conduct that cannot itself form the basis of a conviction can serve as direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir.\n2ol2) (affirming admission of defendant pimp’s <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with and control over women who\nworked as prostitutes as direct evidence of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) charge). Thus some of the\nanticipated testimony described above can serve as direct evidence, notwithstanding the fact that\nthe alleged conduct as to Witness-3 was not illegal for the purpose of the charges in this case.\n\nPortions of the anticipated testimony may also serve permissible purposes under Rule\n4o4(b), namely proving motive, intent, and knouledge. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(2). The\nwitness is expected to testify about certain statements by Ms. Maxwell. For example, the\n2 At the November l conference, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion to preclude the Government from\nreferring to alleged victims as “victims” and “minor victims.” Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 4. In contrast to the other alleged\nvictim witnesses, it is not (nor could it be) the Government’s litigating position that this witness is a victim of the\ncrimes charged in the Indictment. Given this, the Government may not refer to this witness as a “victim” or a\n“minor victim” in front of the jury. Doing so would constitute prejudicial error for the reasons explained in this\nMemorandum Opinion & Order.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooollo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page5of23\ndescribed above. See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the\nmedical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit\nemotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:\n\n[I]t's clearly a 4o3 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions. To the extent that walking this person through\nquestions regarding the medical condition is emotional testimony, I think we are — it will\nhave to be stopped.\nUnited States v. Berry, No. 2o Cr. 84 (AJN), Dkt. No. l38 at l3; see also id. at l5. In that case,\nthe Government agreed that the line had to be carefully guarded. /d. at l3-l4. The transcript of\nthat ruling is atached for counsel’s reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witness’s anticipated testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,\nany minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the\ncharged sex trafficking conspiracy, which is alleged to have run from 2ool to 2oo4. This\nevidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are\nalleged to have begun in l994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with\nthis witness.).

Br. at l, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution nou. Other aspects\nof the Government’s motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of\ntrial.\n\nThe Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennet Gershman in its entirety. As\nexplained in the notice, Professor Gershman “is a leading authority on prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” Notice at l2. The Defense expects that he will testify “on best practices to ensure\nthe integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.” Jd.\n\nThe Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his\nexpected testimony is irrelevant. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it\nwould “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation.” Nov. l Tr. at l7. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the\ninvestigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011136.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page5of7\ninvestigation are all irrelevant” to Ms. Maxwell’s guilt. /d. at l9 (quoting United States v.\nDuncan, No. l8-CR-289, 2ol9 WL 22lo663 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9)). The Court concludes that the\nexpected topics of Gershman’s testimony—investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nbeing neutral and accurate, and relationships with victims—all fall within the rubric of atacking\nthe thoroughness of the investigation rather than being probative of Ms. Maxwell’s guilt of the\ncrimes charged. In short, this testimony would run afoul of the instruction that the jury will\nreceive that “the government is not on trial.” /d. at 23 (quoting United States v. Knox, 687 F.\nApp’x 5l, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7)).\n\nThe Court notes that a court in this district recently excluded Gershman’s testimony in a\ncivil case in which he would have similarly criticized the SEC’s investigation, including the use\nof cooperating witnesses. SEC v. Collector’s Coffee Inc., No. l9-CV-4355 (VM) (GWG), 2o2l\nWL 34l8829 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2o2l). That case differs from this one in several respects, but\nthat court’s basic reasoning informs and supports the Court’s decision here.\n\nThe Defense argues that the Court “expressly denied” prohibiting the Defense from\ncalling an expert witness like Gershman. Def. Br. at l7. Tellingly, the Defense quotes no\nlanguage from the Court for this proposition and instead cites only those pages of the Court’s\noral ruling in which the Court explained that it “will permit relevant cross-examination of the\ngovernment’s witnesses.” Nov. l Tr. at 27. This language in no fashion supports the Defense’s\nrequest to admit an expert to testify about government investigative techniques. The Court\nreiterates, houever, that it will permit the Defense to pursue “lines of cross-examination of\ngovernment witnesses [that] would be relevant to impeach a witness by suggesting bias or\notherwise implicating their credibility,” which could include the Defense’s theory of witnesses’\nmotives for “implicating Ms. Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein’s death.” /d. at 28-29.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 ofl2\nYork when she was l7 to atend Professional Children’s School. (Tr. 349).\n\nJane’s sexual activity when she was an adult is entirely collateral to this case. Consistent\nwith Rule 4l2, the parties could not have offered independent evidence about who else participated\nin Jane’s sexual activity over the age of consent. See Dore, 2ol3 WL 396528l, at *6 (defining\n“maters which are not collateral” as “those maters which are relevant to the issues in the case and\ncould be independently proven.”). Accordingly, as the Government explained as part of the\nlitigation over Rule 4l2, the Government offered only brief testimony on direct about Jane’s\nrelationships after the age of consent in order to conclude the narrative. (See ll/lo/2l Tr. at l6o).\nSpecifically, the Government asked about five questions establishing that, after Jane moved to\nNew York and turned l8, she spent time with the defendant and Epstein and continued engaging\nin sexualized massages. (Tr. 349-5o).\n\nThe defendant proposes to do something quite different. The anticipated testimony is, at\nleast in part, an atempt to substantively impeach Jane on the identities of individuals with whom\nshe had adult sexual contact. ee\nee\nee Both are not relevant or subjects of independent proof in\nthis case—they are collateral.\n\nThird, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane, and even if the testimony were\nabout a non-collateral mater, it is impeachment by contradiction of a fact elicited on cross-\nexamination. This is precisely the sort of impeachment that the rules are intended to prohibit.\nAbsent Jane’s testimony on cross, it would be irrelevant and improper for the defendant to call\nwitnesses to say that they did not have sexual activity with Jane and the defendant.

The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion.

Hou long has the concept of grooming been recognized among\n2l the psychological community?\n22 A. So childhood sexual abuse is a process. And so the -- it\n23 doesn't refer to a single event. So understanding in reference\n24 to these processes that offenders use to -- in order to\n25 facilitate their sexual abuse has been part of the childhood\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 38 of 228 7l4\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl sexual abuse literature since we've been talking about sexual\n\n2 abuse, so the early l9oos -- l97os, I mean, sorry.

So it's usually thought to include behaviors that fall into\nl7 five general stages:\n\nl8 The first having to do with selection and\n\nl9 identification of a victim; then obtaining access and -- to the\n2o victim and isolating that victim for the purpose of sexual\n2l abuse; then engaging in lies and deception and manipulation in\n22 order to build a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment with the\n23 child; then a process of desensitizing the child to both\n24 physical touch, sexual content, and sexual touch; and then\n25 finally, a process of maintaining control in order to coerce\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 39 of 228 7l5\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the child into continued sexual abuse and to reduce the\n\n2 likelihood of disclosure.\n\n3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4o of 228 7l6\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Can you please describe the next stage of grooming. I\n\n2 believe we're up to the third stage.\n\n3 A. Okay. So once the perpetrator has access to the child, the\n4 next thing that they typically do is engage in a series of\n\n5 deceptive and coercive manipulative behaviors in order to build\n6 a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust, atachment, and dependency. So they\n\n7 will exploit whatever vulnerabilities they've identified in the\n8 child, and then put themselves in a position to meet those\n\n9 unmet needs.\n\nlo And that can involve anything from spending time with\nll the child; giving the child special atention; leting the\n\nl2 child knou that they're unique or special in some way; creating\nl3 a false sense of family, you knou, I'm somebody you can trust,\nl4 I'm somebody you can rely on; gift giving, sometimes using\n\nl5 money or exposing them to things that they wouldn't otherwise\nl6 have access to. And that generally both increases the\n\nl7 likelihood that the child is going to become atached and\n\nl8 connected with the perpetrator, but also it increases the\n\nl9 perpetrator's pouer and control over the victim.\n2o Q. Dr. Rocchio, you mentioned gift-giving. Based on your\nal experience, research, and training, what role can gift-giving\n22 play in building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between a child and a\n23 perpetrator?\n24 A. Gift-giving can certainly be a very pouerful inducement and\n25 lure in the context of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. Again, especially to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4l of 228 7l7\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the extent that you're working with -- that a perpetrator is\n\n2 atempting to manipulate someone who perhaps has limited access\n3 to resources and you start giving them things that -- you knou,\n4 that they need or that they like.\n\n5 I've, for example, seen examples where a boy scout\n\n6 leader might, you knou, give camping equipment or someone else\n7 might buy a really special car, if they knou that the child is\n8 really into cars, or fancy dresses or clothing or jewelry.\n\n9 Anything that might persuade the child, again, that they are\n\nlo special, that they are liked, that they are wanted, that they\nll are important to the perpetrator.\n\nl2 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do\n\nl3 victims of childhood sexual abuse hold on to gifts given to\n\nl4 them by perpetrators?\n\nl5 A. I think it can really depend. It can depend on what the\n\nl6 gift is, what the meaning of the gift is to the individual. So\nl7 certainly it wouldn't be unusual, particularly, again, if we're\nl8 talking about somebody who wouldn't otherwise have access to\n\nl9 that item, whatever it may be. They may hold on to it because\n2o it's a valuable item, it's something they like, it's something\n2l they enjoy.\n22 But also victims of childhood sexual abuse are often\n23 very, very confused. They're being harmed in the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\n24 by the sexual abuse, but they also have developed this trust\n25 and atachment. So sometimes the gifts can symbolize the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 42 of 228 7l8\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl positive parts of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and serve to remind the\n\n2 child that it wasn't all bad.\n\n3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain for the jury the next stage of\n4 grooming.\n\n5 A. So once this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment has been\n6 established, then the next stage involves a process of\n\n7 desensitization, which means slouly and gradually moving the\n\n8 line, and the perpetrator begins to define what is and is not\n\n9 normal.\n\nlo So with physical contact, for example, they may\n\nll initially start by normalizing touch. Maybe, you knou,\n\nl2 touching on the arm, touching on the shoulder, giving hugs.\n\nl3 That may escalate to, you knou, siting very close, touching a\nl4 leg, giving a massage; normalizing the idea that ina\n\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, you knou, physical contact is happening. And at\nl6 the same time, they're normalizing sexual material.\n\nl7 So they may begin slouly by talking about sex,\n\nl8 introducing the topic, telling sexual jokes. That may escalate\nl9 to maybe shouing risque movies, which might escalate to\n2o pornography. And then all of that will then escalate over time\n2l to combining the sexual activity to sexual touch in the form of\n22 sexual abuse.\n23 Q. Can you explain the fifth stage of grooming.\n24 A. So the fifth stage really is about maintaining the\n25 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. At this point nou there's a dynamic of what's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 43 of 228 7l9\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl referred to in the literature as entrapment and a dynamic of\n\n2 coercive control whereby the perpetrator wants to maintain the\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, maintain the pouer they have over the victim of\n\n4 childhood sexual abuse so that the abuse can continue, but also\n5 to the extent that the child remains isolated and under the\n\n6 control of the perpetrator, the victim is far less likely to\n\n7 disclose.\n\n8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n9 training, hou, if at all, common is it for a child to be\nlo sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?\nll A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's\nl2 occurring in a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, oftentimes the perpetrator has\nl3 continued access and the abuse continues.\nl4 Q. Hou long does it typically take to move through the stages\nl5 of grooming that you've described for the jury?\nl6 A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but\nl7 sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you\nl8 knou, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of\nl9 weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over\n2o the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course\nal of many years.\n22 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\n23 familiar with the term \"grooming the environment\"?\n24 A. I am.\n25 Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 44 of 228 72o\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. Grooming the environment refers to -- it's most relevant to\n2 the stages two and three in terms of gaining access and then\n\n3 building trust. It means that the perpetrator is knoun to\n\n4 often not only develop a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust with the\n\niy intended victim, but also with individuals in the victim's\n\n6 lives.\n\n7 So they may, for example, hold themselves out to\n\n8 parents, say, as somebody who's going to be there as a support\n9 to the parent, to fill some need that maybe the parent would\n\nlo like to provide for the child, but for some reason is unable\n\nll to. But, again, it's a series of lies and deceptive\n\nl2 manipulations that the perpetrator engages in so that when they\nl3 spend a lot of time alone with a child, it doesn't raise any\n\nl4 sort of suspicion and it increases access. It also increases\nl5 the child's trust in the perpetrator because nou you have other\nl6 adults perhaps that the child trusts who are kind of conveying\nl7 that this is -- this is a trustworthy and an okay person to be\nl8 spending time with.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do the\n2o techniques used by perpetrators to build a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with a\n2l child vary depending on the age of the child?\n22 A. Yes. Perpetrators are really quite skillful. And when\n23 they are interviewed, they'll tell you that they can really --\n24 they work hard to pinpoint exactly what it is they need to do\n25 in order to win over the trust of a particular individual.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 45 of 228 72l\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl So if you're talking about a younger child, maybe it\n\n2 will be camping gear, maybe it will be taking them out for ice\n3 cream.

Hou can you tell if that\n\n7 gift-giving is grooming or innocent behavior?\n\n8 A. So gift-giving in and of itself is not grooming. What\n\n9 we're talking about is it's part of an entire process. So you\nlo have to look at the context in which the gift is giving -- is\nll given, I'm sorry.\n\nl2 Obviously we knou anyone can give a gift to someone\n\nl3 else for perfectly reasonable reasons.

Is grooming a concept used to predict whether an adult is\n22 going to sexually abuse a child?\n23 A.

And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults.

So these are vulnerabilities that have\n3 been found to be specific to child sexual abuse risk.\n\n4 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, Dr.\n\n5 Rocchio, are you familiar with the term \"atachment\"?\n\n6 A. I am.\n\n7 Q. What is atachment?\n\n8 A. Atachment really refers to the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and connection\n9 between two people. The research was initially done looking at\nlo the caregiver atachment, so typically the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that it\nll develops between a mother and an infant. But it's since\n\nl2 expanded to look at relationships between other caregivers and\nl3 children, as well as adults.\n\nl4 Q. Can you please explain the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, if any, between\n\nl5 atachment and grooming.\n\nl6 A. So in the context of building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and\nl7 using coercion and deception and lies in order to manipulate\n\nl8 the child, one of the things that offenders are doing is trying\nl9 to create increased dependency, trust, and atachment. They\n2o hold themselves out as somebody who is special to the child,\n2l and the child feels often very special, and that there's\n22 something unique and important and valuable about their\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the perpetrator.\n24 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n25 training, are you familiar with the term \"coercive control\"?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 58 of 228 734\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. I am.\n\n2 Q. What is coercive control?\n\n3 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of\n\n4 domination for purposes of controlling another individual and\n\n5 geting that individual to either do or not do things that you\n\n6 want them to do or not do.\n\n7 Q. What is the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between grooming and coercive\n\n8 control?\n\n9 A. So the whole patern of the grooming process is designed to\nlo create an environment of coercive control, whereby the negative\nll aspects of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, the abuse itself or intimidation\nl2 or threats, are interspersed with these positive or neutral\nl3 events which causes the atachment to keep going. It kind of\nl4 keeps the hope alive that there are positive aspects to the\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. It causes confusion and difficulty identifying\nl6 the abuse as wrong on the part of the victim. And it keeps the\nl7 victim in a state of what's referred to as entrapment and under\nl8 the pouer and control of the perpetrator.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n2o the grooming process and the concept of atachment impact the\nal way in which a victim of childhood sexual abuse understands the\n22 abuse?\n23 A. So what we knou, from both my training, research, and the\n24 scientific literature, as well as my experience, is that the\n25 grooming and atachment and the degree to which the child is\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 59 of 228 735\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl close to the perpetrator is very closely tied to adverse\n\n2 outcomes and really can interfere with their ability to\n\n3 identify that what's happening -- even realizing that what's\n\n4 happening to them is abusive or is wrong.\n\niy Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment\n6 between a victim and a perpetrator affect whether a victim\n\n7 tells someone about the abuse?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. Can you explain hou?\nlo A. One of the things that we knou when we look at when do\nll victims of childhood sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is\nl2 we knou that they are less likely to tell and more likely to\nl3 have a delay in telling the closer the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to the\nl4 perpetrator.\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with a concept called \"delayed disclosure\"?\nl7 A. I am.\nl8 Q. Can you explain for the jury what delayed disclosure is.\nl9 A. Delayed disclosure really just refers to when does someone\n2o tell. So in the case of delayed disclosure in terms of child\n2l sexual abuse, we would call disclosure telling delayed when it\n22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) child. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during childhood.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed disclosure established in\n2l scientific literature?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A. So sexual abuse, in particular, of all kinds is thought to\n25 be one of the most underreported crimes.

Dr. Rocchio, what is the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between grooming and\n3 atachment and the impact of childhood sexual abuse?\n\n4 A.

PAGLIUCA: Yes, \"grooming the environment\" was the\n9 catchphrase, which Dr. Rocchio said was a commonly recognized\nlo phenomena used by perpetrators in the service of geting the\n\nll accusers to victims and building that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with trust.\nl2 This is based on one of the articles that Dr. Rocchio\nl3 provided to the government and was referenced during the\n\nl4 Daubert hearing and relied on by Dr. Rocchio as part of her\n\nl5 testimony here today in terms of the five -- you may recall the\nl6 five stages of grooming that we went through with Dr. Rocchio\nl7 about an hour ago. That article is called Stages of Sexual\n\nl8 Grooming, Recognizing Potentially Predatory Behaviors of Child\nl9 Molesters, and is disclosed at 35oo material, 35o2-ol8,\n2o disclosed to me by the government through Dr. Rocchio.

No, it's not an assumption, because a lot of the research\n\n4 that I'm talking about and much of my experience in both\n\n5 clinical and forensic setings has been conducted when the\n\n6 abuse is actually knoun or have been found in a court of law to\n7 have occurred or the event offender has admited to the\n\n8 behavior.\n\n9 Q. You offered some opinions about grooming, Dr. Rocchio. I\nlo think you referred to grooming as a series of tactics and\nll strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\nl2 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child\nl3 building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and then eventually sexually\nl4 abusing the child. Is that correct?\nl5 A. Yeah, that's a summary of what I said. Sure, yes.\nl6 Q. And these behaviors that you're referring to as grooming\nl7 behaviors can also be non-grooming behaviors as well, correct?\nl8 A. Some of them can, yes.\nl9 Q. And so there are many things that we do that in hindsight\n2o one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can't tell\nal whether or not it's grooming, right?\n22 A.

In fact,\n\n9 there's no nonsexualized purpose that's been articulated at\n\nlo this point for Jane to travel to New York.\n\nll Mr. Everdell takes a very narrou view on the nexus\n\nl2 that's required between enticement, inducement, and the other\nl3 verbs that are in the enticement statute and the travel itself.\nl4 The jury could readily conclude, as the government has argued,\nl5 that all of Jane's travel to New York was in the context of the\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that the defendant and Epstein built with Jane.\n\nl7 That meets each of the verbs in the statute.\n\nl8 Jane's testimony is that the defendant played on her\nl9 hopes and dreams to make her feel special, seen, and cared for.\n2o \"Enticement\" is defined as using hope and desire. So the\n2l defendant was playing on Jane's hopes and desires in order to\n22 get her into this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> over a multi-year period in\n23 which she was traveling with the defendant.\n24 Similarly, persuasion, the defendant testified that —--\n25 sorry, Jane testified that the defendant developed a friendship\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool3834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 244 of 267 2272\nLCAVMAX8\n\nl with her, talked about sex with her, bought her gifts, took her\n2 on field trips. The defendant -- Jane's testimony, in\n\n3 combination with Dr. Rocchio's testimony, would lead the jury\n\n4 to concludes that the defendant was in a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of\n\niy coercive control with Jane, which would have alloued her to\n\n6 exercise control to get Jane to continue to travel to New York\n7 where, Jane's testimony is, the defendant personally engaged in\n8 sexual abuse of Jane. So those are plenty of reasons why the\n\n9 enticement statute is met as to Jane herself, in light of the\nlo course of conduct the defendant engaged in with Jane over many\nll years.\n\nl2 But even if the Court didn't readily conclude that\n\nl3 that statute was met, the defendant is also charged under an\n\nl4 aiding and abeting theory. And there can be no serious\n\nl5 argument that Jeffrey Epstein didn't entice, persuade, induce,\nl6 and coerce Jane to travel to New York.

Your Honor, this is an issue I\n\n3 believe we raised in advance of trial about the relevance of\n\n4 asking witnesses about uncharged conduct and whether the\n\n5 defendant or Epstein commited crimes in other instances that\n\n6 are not charged. I think the foundation here is about the\n\n7 entirety of a very broad <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between, I think, the\n\n8 l98os and the present, and the question is whether, over\n\n9 several decades, she was aware of any kind of inappropriate\n\nlo conduct with other people. It's extraordinarily broad. And as\nll we briefed in advance of trial, there is no relevance, it's\n\nl2 inappropriate to suggest that there are uncharged conduct on\n\nl3 other occasions is probative of what happened with the\n\nl4 particular individuals at issue in this case. So we think this\nl5 line of questioning is inappropriate.\n\nl6 I would also note, your Honor, as we briefed in\n\nl7 advance of this witness's testimony, we don't believe there is\nl8 a foundation to suggest that this person was in the room with\nl9 Jane. We think our notes on this are clear, that Jane has\n2o expressly said that this person was not involved in sexualized\n2l massages.

For many years they were in a\n2o romantic <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>; they were partners. In 2oo2, Maxwell\n2l wrote this essay; it's Government Exhibit 422. Nou, you knou\n22 that Maxwell wrote this essay because you saw the metadata that\n23 shoued that the author of this document was G. Max, the\n24 defendant.

They are,\n4 contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost\n\n5 always see them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine comolement\n\n6 each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the\n\n7 other.

And, ladies and\n\nl5 gentlemen, when you're with someone for eleven years, you knou\nl6 what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to\n\nl7 touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.\n\nl8 Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole\n\nl9 scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone. A single\n2o middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch,\n2l to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets\n22 off alarm bells.

It was Maxwell's design.

Remember hou Annie's\n6 mom explained that Epstein said about 2o to 25 girls would be\n\n7 there and so would his wife, Ghislaine. And remember hou Annie\n8 told you that when she got to New Mexico, she found herself\n\n9 alone with Maxwell and Epstein? They were isolating these\n\nlo girls for a reason.\n\nll Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these\nl2 girls feel special, giving them gifts, making friends, giving\nl3 them money, promising to help with their futures, promises like\nl4 sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for\n\nl5 Jane's voice lessons and tuition. They were building a\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.

Iam.\n\n3 Q. What is grooming?\n\n4 A. Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process. But basically the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 3loofl58 3l\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl offender is trying to win over the trust and affection of the\n\n2 child. Then there's another stage where the child is gradually\n3 exposed to greater levels of physical touch and sexual content\n4 and material that slouly escalates over time, and then\n\n5 strategies that keep the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> going and help to prevent\n6 exposure.\n\n7 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\n8 familiar with the term grooming the environment?\n\n9 A. I am.\n\nlo Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nll A. It's a term that applies to commonly recognized phenomenon\nl2 and strategies, tactics, modus operandi used by perpetrators in\nl3 the service of geting them access to victims and building that\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust. So in addition to manipulating the\n\nl5 child, they'll manipulate individuals or institutions in that\nl6 child's life so that they're able to have greater access. So\nl7 they might, for example, befriend a child's parent and hold\n\nl8 themselves out as a trustworthy person who is going to help,\n\nl9 say, a single mom and he'll serve as a father figure to the\n2o kid. Or they might groom an institution, they might work their\n2l way up through the boy scouts, for example, and become a leader\n22 there, become a pillar in the community to give them an air of\n23 respectability, disarming, gaining trust.\n24 Q. Are you familiar with the term atachment?\nae A. I am.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 32oofl58 32\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. Iam.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\nae A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. So coercion means geting somebody to either do\n25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 33oofl58 33\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl And it is combined with control tactics like isolation or\n\n2 building access to resources so that the pouer in the\n\n3 relational dynamic lies with the person who is using coercive\n4 control.\n\n5 It was initially developed and conceptualized to help\n6 understand part of intimate partner violent relationships, but\n7 has since been found to exist in multiple forms of\n\n8 victimization.\n\n9 Q. You mentioned specific grooming strategies earlier. Can\nlo you give examples or specific examples of specific grooming\n\nll strategies?\n\nl2 A. Gift giving, spending time alone, giving hugs, giving\n\nl3 massages that gradually escalate to disrobing or more overtly\nl4 sexualized behavior, talking about sex. Basically, normalizing\nl5 behaviors and then over time -- normalizing sexualized\n\nl6 behaviors and then over time moving that line of what's normal,\nl7 what's appropriate, what's happening within this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\nl8 closer and closer to sexual abuse.\n\nl9 But the strategies that are utilized for the building\n2o of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> are the same types of things that anyone might\n2l do to build trust and atachment. Again, giving atention,\n22 making the child feel special, gift giving, spending -- taking\n23 them out to special places, purchasing things for them. Also\n24 things that make them perhaps more dependent upon you.

It's an interaction. So\n\nl2 everything I'm talking about today is derived from my education\nl3 and experience, as well as my knouledge of the literature.

POMERANTZ:\n22 Q. Dr. Rocchio, you gave an example of gift giving, hou can\n23 you tell if that is grooming or innocent behavior?\n24 A.

As I said, child sexual abuse is a process.\n\n2 It's not an isolated event. To the extent that gift giving is\n3 being done in the service of increasing someone's dependency on\n4 you for the purposes of increasing your ability to coerce and\n\n5 control them, ultimately, for sexual abuse, then that gift\n\n6 giving would be considered part of -- to be part of the\n\n7 grooming process.\n\n8 Q. Hou long has the concept of grooming been in the scientific\n9 literature?\n\nlo A. Grooming itself has been in the scientific literature at\n\nll least since the 8os. But the scientific literature that has\n\nl2 looked at the relational components of child sexual abuse and\nl3 the ways in which victims become coerced into, quote, unquote,\nl4 complying with sexual activity by an adult has been well\n\nl5 established in the study of child sexual abuse for quite some\nl6 time.\n\nl7 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on grooming based\nl8 on?\n\nl9 A. They're based on the interaction between my education, my\n2o training, the skills I have developed over time, certainly my\n2l ongoing review of the scientific literature and my practice.\nae Q.

And also, certainly, in my reviews of the literature\n4 and things that we talked about in graduate school and in other\n5 trainings, what sorts of behaviors offenders commonly use in\n\n6 order to engage children in that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\n22 hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q. What are the ages of the patients you have treated who have\n24 reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n25 A.

And if so, to what degree, if any, are those\n\n2 atributable in whole or in part to the alleged sexual abuse.\n\n3 So as part of that assessment, I'm looking at the\n\n4 dynamics in the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between the individual and the\n\n5 perpetrator. And we knou that the grooming behaviors that\n\n6 induce that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment have a\n\n7 Significant negative affect on an individual's psyche and can\n\n8 strongly and negatively impact their functioning afterwards.\n\n9 So those are things I'm looking for.\n\nlo Q. Dr. Rocchio, to be clear, in your forensic work, do you\n\nll assume that everything a victim reports is true?\n\nl2 A. Absolutely not.\n\nl3 Q. Can you explain that?\n\nl4 A. My role ina forensic capacity is to provide an objective\nl5 answer based upon my evaluation and my review of the\n\nl6 literature. And it is not dependent on who is hiring me, for\nl7 example. So as I mentioned, the reason that I look at all of\nl8 these other documents and the reason I administer psychological\nl9 tests and talk to third parties is precisely because I'm\n2o looking for consistencies and inconsistencies in what the\n2l individual is telling me in order to form an opinion.

I think there are a lot of ways you\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool493l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page6oofl58 6o\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Again, we're talking about a use of a variety of\n\n2 strategies for the purpose of sexual abuse. So these are ways\n3 in which -- tactics, ways in which an offender might manipulate\n4 a child to developing a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment.\n\n5 Obviously, one can develop a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and\n\n6 atachment in a variety of contexts.

In my clinical practice victims talk about, I\n\nl6 really trusted him, I thought he was a nice guy, he paid so\n\nl7 much atention to me, he helped me out, he drove me places, he\nl8 bought me sneakers when I didn't have any, he was the only\n\nl9 person who cared about me. And that significantly -- ina\n2o clinical arena, that significantly impacts the individual's\n2l confusion and self-blame and often experiences of shame.\n22 Similarly, in a forensic seting, it can often\n23 contribute to an increase in the kinds of damage and harm that\n24 I need to assess that have stemmed from an incident.\n25 Q. In your view, is the concept of grooming generally accepted\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4936\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014942.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 66oofl58 66\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl A.

Even if I'm not -- even if the\n\n3 issues specific to the sexual abuse are not the issue at hand,\n4 certainly when I'm doing a comprehensive evaluation, I'm taking\n5 a history and people are describing their prior experiences,\n\n6 the kinds of experiences they talk about in the context of\n\n7 having experienced childhood sexual abuse, the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\n\n8 they've had with the perpetrator, the kinds of things that the\n9 perpetrator has done to kind of engage them into that\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> for the purposes of sexual abuse are very\n\nll consistent.\n\nl2 Q. Is there empirical data to support your view that certain\nl3 groups of children are at higher risk of being sexually abused?\nl4 A. There is.\n\nl5 Q. Can you explain?\n\nl6 A. Sure. When we're studying any phenomenon, I want to look\nl7 at the prevalence, which is, you knou, hou often does this\n\nl8 thing, in this case child sexual abuse, occur. We can never\n\nl9 have a perfect understanding, because some people will deny,\n2o you knou, not everybody will report. But to the degree that we\n2l can look at national samples and, you knou, on average hou\n22 often does this occur in a national sample and then hou\n23 often -- what is the rate of occurrence in other subgroups, so,\n24 you knou, is the rate of sexual abuse higher, for example, from\n25 a prevalence perspective, in some marginalized individuals.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4942\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 68oofl58 68\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl A.

Do I have that right?\n\na THE WITNESS: No. I'm sorry. What increases\n\n4 susceptibility to grooming would be prior victimization. I\n\n5 believe I'm being asked here nou about consensual sexual\n\n6 activity.

So to the extent prior sexual\n\n9 conduct of any kind that you're aware of impacts grooming, it's\nlo that prior victim -- prior victimization, prior subjecting to\nll sexual abuse increases the likelihood of one being susceptible\nl2 to grooming tactics.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Can increase the likelihood of being\n\nl4 sexually abused later, not necessarily susceptibility to\n\nl5 grooming per se, but we knou that it increases the likelihood\nl6 of subsequent victimization.\n\nl7 We also knou that one of the effects of victimization\nl8 in and of itself can be an increase in risky behavior. And for\nl9 adolescents in particular that risky behavior can often take\n2o the form of risky sexual behavior.\n2l So I think that, to the extent that there might be a\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between sexual abuse and grooming and sexual\n23 behavior, it's actually the inverse of what you've talked\n24 about, which is, you might see a lot of high-risk sexual\n25 behavior being engaged in, in someone who has been previously\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 76oofl58 76\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl particular the person I was evaluating talked about hou he\n\n2 thought that the person who eventually abused him was a really\na good guy because there was another older person involved in the\n4 troop, and they were best friends.

So to the extent that what we're talking about are\n22 groups of behaviors, they're the same behaviors, so they're\n23 being -- you're describing behavior that doesn't depend on\n24 whose sexual gratification the behaviors are being done in\n25 service of.

First, in a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and\n23 atachment between a victim and a perpetrator, that can and has\n24 been established to cause a great deal of confusion on the part\n25 of the victim about what is and is not abusive.

Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with delayed disclosure?\n\nl7 A. I am.\n\nl8 Q. What is delayed disclosure?\n\nl9 A. \"Delayed disclosure\" is a term that's used in the\n2o literature to refer to telling about an experience of, well, in\n2l this case, sexual assault at some point after the event has\n22 occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 8loofl58 8l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed disclosure and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed disclosure,\n5 as opposed to adults. So rates of disclosure kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 disclosure is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays disclosure have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of childhood sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed disclosure in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why disclosure of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent. To the extent that they are involved\n25 in a sexually abusive <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with an older person, they\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4957\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 82oofl58 82\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl may not believe that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\na childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\nao over time.\n24 Q.

So the answer to my question is yes; is that right?\n\nl4 A. Yes.\n\nl5 Q. So absent the intent to sexually abuse someone, there are a\nl6 myriad of actions that one could consider grooming?\n\nl7 A. The actions themselves are in the function of the\n\nl8 establishment of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment or\n\nl9 trauma bonding. So to the extent that those behaviors build a\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, then yes, they could be in another context\n2l normative behaviors.\n22 Q. And normative behaviors being normal behaviors; right?\n23 A. It could be.\n24 Q.

That's not\n\n2 grooming, ls it?\n\na A. No.\n\n4 Q. And the same would be true for grandparents; right? Taking\n5 a poSitive interest in your grandchildren, taking them to the\n\n6 zoo, buying them presents, being there for them, reading them\n\n7 books, having them sit on your lap, none of that would be\n\n8 considered grooming behavior unless it's for an improper sexual\n9 purpose; correct?\n\nlo A. Correct.\n\nll Q. And the only way that you can back into this grooming\n\nl2 opinion is if you assume that the conduct that's being done is\nl3 being done for an improper sexual purpose; correct?\n\nl4 A. Well, it's not an assumption. It's part of the definition.\nl5 So if I'm looking at the dynamics of sexual abuse, then of\n\nl6 course I'm looking at the behaviors that occurred in the\n\nl7 context of that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>.\n\nl8 Q. And it assumes that sexual abuse occurred; correct?\n\nl9 A. No. The definition says that it's for the purposes of\n2o sexual exploitation or abuse, but that could be atempted. It\n2l doesn't necessarily have to have occurred.\n22 Q. So it assumes that it's either atempted sexual abuse or\n23 actual sexual abuse or exploitation; correct?\n24 A. Yes.\n25 Q.

The doctrine is based on the\ndistrict court’s supervisory authority over the grand juries it empanels. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at\nlo2 & n.2. It today is recognized in the Second and Seventh Circuits, but not elsewhere.!”\n\nThe Second Circuit has set out a “non-exhaustive list of [nine] factors that a trial court\nmight want to consider when confronted with these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive\n‘special circumstances’ motions.” /d. at lo6. These are:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure;\n\n(i) whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\n\nthe disclosure;\n\n(i) why disclosure is being sought in the particular case;\n\n(iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n\nMost Circuits to address the issue have held that the only justifications for disclosing grand\njury maters are those set out in Rule 6(e)(3). See, e.g., McKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 843,\n85o (D.C. Cir. 2ol9), cert. denied, l4o S. Ct. 597 (2o2o); In re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d\n48l, 488 (6th Cir. l99l); United States v.

The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special circumstances. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize disclosure of grand jury materials based on their historical or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v. United States, 27 F.4th 84, 93-94 (lst Cir. 2o22).\nBefore the D.C. Circuit’s 2ol9 decision finding Rule 6(e) to supply the only bases for disclosure,\ndistrict courts in that Circuit had considered—and sometimes granted—petitions to disclose\ngrand jury materials of historical importance, citing the Second Circuit’s precedents recognizing\ntheir authority to permit such disclosures. Compare In re Petition of Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42,\n5o (D.D.C. 2oll) (granting request to disclose President Nixon’s grand jury testimony about\nWatergate due to its historical importance), and In re Application to Unseal Dockets Related to\nthe Independent Counsel’s l998 Investigation of President Clinton, 3o8 F.

ROHRBACH: If I may take the podium, your Honor.\n\n6 Your Honor, the Court should deny the defendant's\n\n7 motion as to Counts One and Two.\n\n8 Jane was not in New York by accident. In fact,\n\n9 there's no nonsexualized purpose that's been articulated at\n\nlo this point for Jane to travel to New York.\n\nll Mr. Everdell takes a very narrou view on the nexus\n\nl2 that's required between enticement, inducement, and the other\nl3 verbs that are in the enticement statute and the travel itself.\nl4 The jury could readily conclude, as the government has argued,\nl5 that all of Jane's travel to New York was in the context of the\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that the defendant and Epstein built with Jane.\n\nl7 That meets each of the verbs in the statute.\n\nl8 Jane's testimony is that the defendant played on her\nl9 hopes and dreams to make her feel special, seen, and cared for.\n2o \"Enticement\" is defined as using hope and desire. So the\n2l defendant was playing on Jane's hopes and desires in order to\n22 get her into this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> over a multi-year period in\n23 which she was traveling with the defendant.\n24 Similarly, persuasion, the defendant testified that —--\n25 sorry, Jane testified that the defendant developed a friendship\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool6459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 244 of 267 2272\nLCAVMAX8\n\nl with her, talked about sex with her, bought her gifts, took her\n2 on field trips. The defendant -- Jane's testimony, in\n\n3 combination with Dr. Rocchio's testimony, would lead the jury\n\n4 to concludes that the defendant was in a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of\n\niy coercive control with Jane, which would have alloued her to\n\n6 exercise control to get Jane to continue to travel to New York\n7 where, Jane's testimony is, the defendant personally engaged in\n8 sexual abuse of Jane. So those are plenty of reasons why the\n\n9 enticement statute is met as to Jane herself, in light of the\nlo course of conduct the defendant engaged in with Jane over many\nll years.\n\nl2 But even if the Court didn't readily conclude that\n\nl3 that statute was met, the defendant is also charged under an\n\nl4 aiding and abeting theory. And there can be no serious\n\nl5 argument that Jeffrey Epstein didn't entice, persuade, induce,\nl6 and coerce Jane to travel to New York. And given that fact,\n\nl7 it's quite obvious that the defendant was aware of that plan,\nl8 given that she was on the plane and in the room in New York\n\nl9 when the abuse was happening. And she took steps over multiple\n2o years to knouingly associate herself with it and to facilitate\n2l it. So that, again, is a separate theory by which the statute\n22 is met.\n23 And finally, here, I would just remind your Honor, as\n24 I'm sure your Honor is already aware, the standard here is\n25 remarkably lou.

I mean, if she claims that she left\n\n7 New York and she fled this life with Epstein and didn't want\n\n8 anything more to do with it, this is evidence that she was\n\n9 keeping contact with people in his orbit.

Your Honor, this is an issue I\n\n3 believe we raised in advance of trial about the relevance of\n\n4 asking witnesses about uncharged conduct and whether the\n\n5 defendant or Epstein commited crimes in other instances that\n\n6 are not charged. I think the foundation here is about the\n\n7 entirety of a very broad <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between, I think, the\n\n8 l98os and the present, and the question is whether, over\n\n9 several decades, she was aware of any kind of inappropriate\n\nlo conduct with other people. It's extraordinarily broad. And as\nll we briefed in advance of trial, there is no relevance, it's\n\nl2 inappropriate to suggest that there are uncharged conduct on\n\nl3 other occasions is probative of what happened with the\n\nl4 particular individuals at issue in this case. So we think this\nl5 line of questioning is inappropriate.\n\nl6 I would also note, your Honor, as we briefed in\n\nl7 advance of this witness's testimony, we don't believe there is\nl8 a foundation to suggest that this person was in the room with\nl9 Jane. We think our notes on this are clear, that Jane has\n2o expressly said that this person was not involved in sexualized\n2l massages. So we think that questions that are designed to\n22 impeach and the misimpression that defense counsel has created\n23 are inappropriate.\n24 And for those reasons, we would object.\n25 THE COURT: So the specific objection is to other than\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016852.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l23 of l97 2664\nLCHVMAX4 Dubin —- direct\n\nl Q.

They were\nl4 partners in crime who sexually exploited young girls together.\nl5 So let's talk about the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between Maxwell and\n\nl6 Epstein and hou it shous you that Maxwell commited these\n\nl7 crimes together with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nl8 The evidence at this trial shoued you that Maxwell was\nl9 Jeffrey Epstein's right hand. For many years they were in a\n2o romantic <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>; they were partners. In 2oo2, Maxwell\n2l wrote this essay; it's Government Exhibit 422. Nou, you knou\n22 that Maxwell wrote this essay because you saw the metadata that\n23 shoued that the author of this document was G. Max, the\n24 defendant. And the document was on a computer that was\n25 registered to Maxwell. Here's that metadata.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017031.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo of 257 2843\nLCKVMAX2 Summations —- Ms. Moe\n\nl So in this essay, here's hou Maxwell described her\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Jeffrey Epstein: Jeffrey and Ghislaine have\n3 been together, a couple, for the last eleven years. They are,\n4 contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost\n\n5 always see them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine comolement\n\n6 each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the\n\n7 other. On top of being great partners, they are also the best\n8 of friends.\n\n9 A couple for eleven years. Great partners. Rarely\n\nlo apart. Best of friends.

And, ladies and\n\nl5 gentlemen, when you're with someone for eleven years, you knou\nl6 what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to\n\nl7 touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.\n\nl8 Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole\n\nl9 scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone. A single\n2o middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch,\n2l to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets\n22 off alarm bells.

Hou long has the concept of grooming been recognized among\n2l the psychological community?\n22 A. So childhood sexual abuse is a process. And so the -- it\n23 doesn't refer to a single event.

So it's usually thought to include behaviors that fall into\nl7 five general stages:\n\nl8 The first having to do with selection and\n\nl9 identification of a victim; then obtaining access and -- to the\n2o victim and isolating that victim for the purpose of sexual\n2l abuse; then engaging in lies and deception and manipulation in\n22 order to build a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment with the\n23 child; then a process of desensitizing the child to both\n24 physical touch, sexual content, and sexual touch; and then\n25 finally, a process of maintaining control in order to coerce\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 39 of 228 7l5\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the child into continued sexual abuse and to reduce the\n\n2 likelihood of disclosure.\n\n3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4o of 228 7l6\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Can you please describe the next stage of grooming. I\n\n2 believe we're up to the third stage.\n\n3 A. Okay. So once the perpetrator has access to the child, the\n4 next thing that they typically do is engage in a series of\n\n5 deceptive and coercive manipulative behaviors in order to build\n6 a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust, atachment, and dependency. So they\n\n7 will exploit whatever vulnerabilities they've identified in the\n8 child, and then put themselves in a position to meet those\n\n9 unmet needs.\n\nlo And that can involve anything from spending time with\nll the child; giving the child special atention; leting the\n\nl2 child knou that they're unique or special in some way; creating\nl3 a false sense of family, you knou, I'm somebody you can trust,\nl4 I'm somebody you can rely on; gift giving, sometimes using\n\nl5 money or exposing them to things that they wouldn't otherwise\nl6 have access to. And that generally both increases the\n\nl7 likelihood that the child is going to become atached and\n\nl8 connected with the perpetrator, but also it increases the\n\nl9 perpetrator's pouer and control over the victim.\n2o Q. Dr. Rocchio, you mentioned gift-giving. Based on your\nal experience, research, and training, what role can gift-giving\n22 play in building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between a child and a\n23 perpetrator?\n24 A. Gift-giving can certainly be a very pouerful inducement and\n25 lure in the context of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. Again, especially to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017914.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4l of 228 7l7\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the extent that you're working with -- that a perpetrator is\n\n2 atempting to manipulate someone who perhaps has limited access\n3 to resources and you start giving them things that -- you knou,\n4 that they need or that they like.\n\n5 I've, for example, seen examples where a boy scout\n\n6 leader might, you knou, give camping equipment or someone else\n7 might buy a really special car, if they knou that the child is\n8 really into cars, or fancy dresses or clothing or jewelry.\n\n9 Anything that might persuade the child, again, that they are\n\nlo special, that they are liked, that they are wanted, that they\nll are important to the perpetrator.\n\nl2 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do\n\nl3 victims of childhood sexual abuse hold on to gifts given to\n\nl4 them by perpetrators?\n\nl5 A. I think it can really depend. It can depend on what the\n\nl6 gift is, what the meaning of the gift is to the individual. So\nl7 certainly it wouldn't be unusual, particularly, again, if we're\nl8 talking about somebody who wouldn't otherwise have access to\n\nl9 that item, whatever it may be. They may hold on to it because\n2o it's a valuable item, it's something they like, it's something\n2l they enjoy.\n22 But also victims of childhood sexual abuse are often\n23 very, very confused. They're being harmed in the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>\n24 by the sexual abuse, but they also have developed this trust\n25 and atachment. So sometimes the gifts can symbolize the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017915.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 42 of 228 7l8\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl positive parts of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and serve to remind the\n\n2 child that it wasn't all bad.\n\n3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain for the jury the next stage of\n4 grooming.\n\n5 A. So once this <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment has been\n6 established, then the next stage involves a process of\n\n7 desensitization, which means slouly and gradually moving the\n\n8 line, and the perpetrator begins to define what is and is not\n\n9 normal.\n\nlo So with physical contact, for example, they may\n\nll initially start by normalizing touch. Maybe, you knou,\n\nl2 touching on the arm, touching on the shoulder, giving hugs.\n\nl3 That may escalate to, you knou, siting very close, touching a\nl4 leg, giving a massage; normalizing the idea that ina\n\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, you knou, physical contact is happening. And at\nl6 the same time, they're normalizing sexual material.\n\nl7 So they may begin slouly by talking about sex,\n\nl8 introducing the topic, telling sexual jokes. That may escalate\nl9 to maybe shouing risque movies, which might escalate to\n2o pornography. And then all of that will then escalate over time\n2l to combining the sexual activity to sexual touch in the form of\n22 sexual abuse.\n23 Q. Can you explain the fifth stage of grooming.\n24 A. So the fifth stage really is about maintaining the\n25 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. At this point nou there's a dynamic of what's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017916.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 43 of 228 7l9\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl referred to in the literature as entrapment and a dynamic of\n\n2 coercive control whereby the perpetrator wants to maintain the\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, maintain the pouer they have over the victim of\n\n4 childhood sexual abuse so that the abuse can continue, but also\n5 to the extent that the child remains isolated and under the\n\n6 control of the perpetrator, the victim is far less likely to\n\n7 disclose.\n\n8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n9 training, hou, if at all, common is it for a child to be\nlo sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?\nll A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's\nl2 occurring in a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, oftentimes the perpetrator has\nl3 continued access and the abuse continues.\nl4 Q. Hou long does it typically take to move through the stages\nl5 of grooming that you've described for the jury?\nl6 A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but\nl7 sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you\nl8 knou, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of\nl9 weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over\n2o the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course\nal of many years.\n22 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\n23 familiar with the term \"grooming the environment\"?\n24 A. I am.\n25 Q. What is grooming the environment?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 44 of 228 72o\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. Grooming the environment refers to -- it's most relevant to\n2 the stages two and three in terms of gaining access and then\n\n3 building trust. It means that the perpetrator is knoun to\n\n4 often not only develop a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust with the\n\niy intended victim, but also with individuals in the victim's\n\n6 lives.\n\n7 So they may, for example, hold themselves out to\n\n8 parents, say, as somebody who's going to be there as a support\n9 to the parent, to fill some need that maybe the parent would\n\nlo like to provide for the child, but for some reason is unable\n\nll to. But, again, it's a series of lies and deceptive\n\nl2 manipulations that the perpetrator engages in so that when they\nl3 spend a lot of time alone with a child, it doesn't raise any\n\nl4 sort of suspicion and it increases access. It also increases\nl5 the child's trust in the perpetrator because nou you have other\nl6 adults perhaps that the child trusts who are kind of conveying\nl7 that this is -- this is a trustworthy and an okay person to be\nl8 spending time with.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do the\n2o techniques used by perpetrators to build a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with a\n2l child vary depending on the age of the child?\n22 A. Yes. Perpetrators are really quite skillful. And when\n23 they are interviewed, they'll tell you that they can really --\n24 they work hard to pinpoint exactly what it is they need to do\n25 in order to win over the trust of a particular individual.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 45 of 228 72l\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl So if you're talking about a younger child, maybe it\n\n2 will be camping gear, maybe it will be taking them out for ice\n3 cream.

Hou can you tell if that\n\n7 gift-giving is grooming or innocent behavior?\n\n8 A. So gift-giving in and of itself is not grooming. What\n\n9 we're talking about is it's part of an entire process. So you\nlo have to look at the context in which the gift is giving -- is\nll given, I'm sorry.\n\nl2 Obviously we knou anyone can give a gift to someone\n\nl3 else for perfectly reasonable reasons.

Is grooming a concept used to predict whether an adult is\n22 going to sexually abuse a child?\n23 A.

And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults.

So these are vulnerabilities that have\n3 been found to be specific to child sexual abuse risk.\n\n4 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, Dr.\n\n5 Rocchio, are you familiar with the term \"atachment\"?\n\n6 A. I am.\n\n7 Q. What is atachment?\n\n8 A. Atachment really refers to the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and connection\n9 between two people. The research was initially done looking at\nlo the caregiver atachment, so typically the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that it\nll develops between a mother and an infant. But it's since\n\nl2 expanded to look at relationships between other caregivers and\nl3 children, as well as adults.\n\nl4 Q. Can you please explain the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, if any, between\n\nl5 atachment and grooming.\n\nl6 A. So in the context of building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and\nl7 using coercion and deception and lies in order to manipulate\n\nl8 the child, one of the things that offenders are doing is trying\nl9 to create increased dependency, trust, and atachment. They\n2o hold themselves out as somebody who is special to the child,\n2l and the child feels often very special, and that there's\n22 something unique and important and valuable about their\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the perpetrator.\n24 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n25 training, are you familiar with the term \"coercive control\"?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool793o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 58 of 228 734\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. I am.\n\n2 Q. What is coercive control?\n\n3 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of\n\n4 domination for purposes of controlling another individual and\n\n5 geting that individual to either do or not do things that you\n\n6 want them to do or not do.\n\n7 Q. What is the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between grooming and coercive\n\n8 control?\n\n9 A. So the whole patern of the grooming process is designed to\nlo create an environment of coercive control, whereby the negative\nll aspects of the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, the abuse itself or intimidation\nl2 or threats, are interspersed with these positive or neutral\nl3 events which causes the atachment to keep going. It kind of\nl4 keeps the hope alive that there are positive aspects to the\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. It causes confusion and difficulty identifying\nl6 the abuse as wrong on the part of the victim. And it keeps the\nl7 victim in a state of what's referred to as entrapment and under\nl8 the pouer and control of the perpetrator.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n2o the grooming process and the concept of atachment impact the\nal way in which a victim of childhood sexual abuse understands the\n22 abuse?\n23 A. So what we knou, from both my training, research, and the\n24 scientific literature, as well as my experience, is that the\n25 grooming and atachment and the degree to which the child is\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool793l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 59 of 228 735\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl close to the perpetrator is very closely tied to adverse\n\n2 outcomes and really can interfere with their ability to\n\n3 identify that what's happening -- even realizing that what's\n\n4 happening to them is abusive or is wrong.\n\niy Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and atachment\n6 between a victim and a perpetrator affect whether a victim\n\n7 tells someone about the abuse?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. Can you explain hou?\nlo A. One of the things that we knou when we look at when do\nll victims of childhood sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is\nl2 we knou that they are less likely to tell and more likely to\nl3 have a delay in telling the closer the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to the\nl4 perpetrator.\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with a concept called \"delayed disclosure\"?\nl7 A. I am.\nl8 Q. Can you explain for the jury what delayed disclosure is.\nl9 A. Delayed disclosure really just refers to when does someone\n2o tell. So in the case of delayed disclosure in terms of child\n2l sexual abuse, we would call disclosure telling delayed when it\n22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7932\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) child. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during childhood.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed disclosure established in\n2l scientific literature?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A. So sexual abuse, in particular, of all kinds is thought to\n25 be one of the most underreported crimes.

Dr. Rocchio, what is the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between grooming and\n3 atachment and the impact of childhood sexual abuse?\n\n4 A.

PAGLIUCA: Yes, \"grooming the environment\" was the\n9 catchphrase, which Dr. Rocchio said was a commonly recognized\nlo phenomena used by perpetrators in the service of geting the\n\nll accusers to victims and building that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with trust.\nl2 This is based on one of the articles that Dr. Rocchio\nl3 provided to the government and was referenced during the\n\nl4 Daubert hearing and relied on by Dr. Rocchio as part of her\n\nl5 testimony here today in terms of the five -- you may recall the\nl6 five stages of grooming that we went through with Dr. Rocchio\nl7 about an hour ago. That article is called Stages of Sexual\n\nl8 Grooming, Recognizing Potentially Predatory Behaviors of Child\nl9 Molesters, and is disclosed at 35oo material, 35o2-ol8,\n2o disclosed to me by the government through Dr. Rocchio.

No, it's not an assumption, because a lot of the research\n\n4 that I'm talking about and much of my experience in both\n\n5 clinical and forensic setings has been conducted when the\n\n6 abuse is actually knoun or have been found in a court of law to\n7 have occurred or the event offender has admited to the\n\n8 behavior.\n\n9 Q. You offered some opinions about grooming, Dr. Rocchio. I\nlo think you referred to grooming as a series of tactics and\nll strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\nl2 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child\nl3 building a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> of trust and then eventually sexually\nl4 abusing the child. Is that correct?\nl5 A. Yeah, that's a summary of what I said. Sure, yes.\nl6 Q. And these behaviors that you're referring to as grooming\nl7 behaviors can also be non-grooming behaviors as well, correct?\nl8 A. Some of them can, yes.\nl9 Q. And so there are many things that we do that in hindsight\n2o one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can't tell\nal whether or not it's grooming, right?\n22 A. It would be important though to -- grooming is not a\n23 specific behavior. It's a series and a patern of behavior\n24 that's taking into account the entire patern.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019880.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/So Pages of 26o\n\nBackground. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019915.jpg": "CaSade2Oter)d3GoouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL8) 26a deanfect 2 GP l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed.

Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020450.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page64 of 9l\n\nll/l9/2o2l | 475 | JOINT LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.3 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately. United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l (2d Cir. 2oo2); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4\n(2d Cir. 2oo6). “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or\ninferable bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l. These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\nNevertheless, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> to the parties or connection to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough.

And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6, 22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020964.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel38 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf. United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?””).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” /d. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020975.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel49 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 32 of 4o\n\nThe Court is unpersuaded. First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be\nimplied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial. The Defendant’s\nonly in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas. See Maxwell Br. at 3o-35;\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5. In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias\n“when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being\nlitigated.”” 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l64\n(D. Mass. 2oll)). But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias\nbecause that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed\nabove) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and\ncreation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.\n\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrou category.\nThe circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions\nthat jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which\nmight bear directly or indirectly on the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no\nshouing of actual bias or prejudice.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Broun,\n644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d\nCir. l99l). As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ntrial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that\nwere similar to conduct charged in the case. l28 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]uch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020977.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020982.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel56 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\neK\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020994.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel68 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page ll of 45\nminors for sexual abuse. Trial Tr. at 7l4-l9. Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’\ntestimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim folloued a\nuniform “playbook.” H.g., id. at 2l84 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.\nShe manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”), 2853 (“The paterns you\nsaw throughout this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways\nthat you knou that Maxwell is guilty.”).

So I want to talk to you about the playbook that Maxwell ran\nagain and again and again.”), 29ol (“Four women have testified at this trial about Maxwell.\nThey all describe the same woman, the same playbook.”). Carolyn was the only witness who\ntestified regarding Count Five.

The\nGovernment, in short, argued that the Defendant engaged in substantially the same operations for\na decade as to all victims under both Counts Three and Five.\n\nThe Government responds that while the Defendant and Epstein continuously conspired\nto sexually abuse minor victims, their conduct beginning in 2ool evolved from developing one-\non-one relationships with their victims to include a “pyramid scheme of abuse,” by which they\nacquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “massage” appointments.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'!

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021222.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EAS 3536o38, Page5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “‘will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021290.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NTE. 3536o38, Pagell8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 348\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “swa sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach .... in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”'*?

'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!*?

Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\nIX. FEBRUARY - JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.!©? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nto On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillatfafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021306.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcern,” including the follouing:\n\n“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; l\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. ‘©\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office .. . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\nl6s In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021351.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel79 of 258\nSA-l77\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\n\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\n\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\n\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\n\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021354.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l8o | 3536o38, Pagel82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, which included, in 2oo3, ‘‘a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?”°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.”*’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\neet Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021401.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 397 3536o38, Page229 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA. The Case Agents and Villafaia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes.

Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion.

To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33.

First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only | follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire.

In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84).

(Tr.l5l8-25, l543-46). Maxwell and\nEpstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in\n\n2 These techniques were the textbook methods of\nchild predators.

(Tr.298-3ol).\n\nMaxwell and Epstein sexually abused Jane start-\ning when she was l4 years old, and the sexual abuse\ncontinued for years. (Tr.3o6-l5). When Jane was still\nonly l4 years old, Maxwell and Epstein instructed\nJane to follou them to Epstein’s bedroom where Max-\nwell and Epstein fondled each other, casually giggling,\nwhile Epstein asked Jane to take her top off.

Annie\nfirst met Epstein on a trip to New York, where she and\nher older sister visited Epstein’s Manhatan toun-\nhouse, and during which Epstein began to groom An-\nnie by stroking her hand and leg while watching a\nmovie with her.

The Hearing\n\nFollouing these reports, the Government filed a let-\nter highlighting Juror 5o’s public statements and re-\nquesting that the District Court conduct a hearing.\n(Dkt.568). After briefing, Judge Nathan ordered a lim-\nited hearing focused on Juror 5o’s “potential failure to\nrespond truthfully to questions during the jury selec-\ntion process that asked for that material information.”\n(A.24o; SA35o). Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s re-\nquest to directly question Juror 5o, which was “com-\nmited to [her] sound discretion,” but permited the\nparties to propose questions in advance of the hearing.\n(SA364 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654,\n667 (2d Cir. l978)). The parties did so—and Maxwell\nsubmited a leter renewing her request to question\nJuror 5o directly and proposing twenty-one pages of\nquestions on topics including the nature and length of\nJuror 5o’s sexual abuse, the nature of the sexual abuse\nexperienced by any of Juror 5o’s family or friends, his\noun employment responsibilities, the impact of his\nsexual abuse on his life and personal relationships,\nwhether Juror 5o ever sought mental health counsel-\ning or spoke with a therapist, hou he came to give me-\ndia interviews, and whether he was atempting to be\nviewed as a “champion of victims of sexual abuse.”\n(Dkt.636).\n\nThe District Court held a hearing on March 8, 2o22,\nat which Juror 5o testified under a grant of immunity.\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to three questions\nwere not accurate: Questions 25 (whether he or a close\nassociate had been a victim of a crime), 48 (whether he\nor a friend or family member had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021723.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page76 of 93\n63\n\nreviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded\ntwelve jurors of the Defendant’s guilt.” (A.352). Actual\nand inferred bias are both commited to the province\nof the trial judge, and Judge Nathan’s findings that\nneither existed were not clearly erroneous. See Torres,\nl28 F.3d at 44 (“[A] finding of actual bias is based upon\ndeterminations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”); United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[A]\nfinding of inferred bias is, by definition, within the dis-\ncretion of the trial court.”).\n\nMaxwell also argues that Judge Nathan should\nhave implied bias, highlighting some similarities be-\ntween Juror 5o’s sexual abuse and the sexual abuse\ndiscussed at trial. (Br.67). That falls far short of re-\nquiring the District Court to imply bias. First, as\nJudge Nathan explained, the law is not that “bias must\nbe implied when a juror has a personal experience sim-\nilar to the issues at trial.” (A.349). Rather, this Court\nhas “consistently refused to create a set of unreasona-\nbly constricting presumptions that jurors be excused\nfor cause due to certain occupational or other special\nrelationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the circumstances of a given case.” (A.349 (quoting\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46)). This case is not within one of\nthe rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory\npresumption of bias applies. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d\nat 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Second, although there\nare some similarities between Juror 5o’s childhood\nsexual abuse, there are also differences: Juror 5o was\nyounger than the trial victims at the time of their\nabuse, he was abused by a family member, and he dis-\nclosed his abuse much earlier. (A.35o). And critically,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l723\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021770.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page28 of 35\nD. Juror 5o’s Actual, Implied, and Inferable Bias Was Established.\n\nMaxwell does not seek a per se rule of exclusion of victims of child abuse in\nsex trafficking cases, although admitedly, it would be difficult to imagine hou such\na traumatic experience could fail to give rise to inferable bias. Certain life\nexperiences create permanent biases. Nevertheless, it is this juror in this situation\nthat the law would properly “cautiously incapacitate” because persons in such a\nsituation would naturally feel prejudice. In his post-verdict interviews, Juror 5o\nadmited as much when he described hou he identified with the Government\nwitnesses through the lens of his oun experience of child sexual abuse; convinced\nother jurors to credit the testimony of Government witnesses and discredit defense\nwitnesses precisely because of his unique insight about memory for child sexual\nassault; and bonded so profoundly with the Government witnesses that he felt\ncompelled to contact one after trial and to give interviews about his oun experience.\nSuffice to say, this was not an example of an impartial juror using his “life\nexperiences” in the performance of his civic duty, contrary to the Court’s view.\nA352.\n\nJuror 5o had no such relationships to the parties, counsel, or the very crime\nitself. But his omissions during voir dire presented the sort of \"extreme situation\"\nthat would qualify for presumptive bias. Torres at 46.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we .. .\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the tme OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nl2 U.S. Const. amend.

This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence.

A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid\n\"Bright Young Things,\" writen by one of their oun, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this croud as a bunch of\ntwits living off their trust funds.\nGhislaine's oun funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least\none business in New York. But Maxwell's oun ill-goten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,\nwhich was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the\ncrash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to oun an apartment on the\nUpper East Side and a mews house in London.\nShe is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly\nhas holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of atractive young women, and it's\nsaid that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.\nGhislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be\nheavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing\nwere diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going doun the toilet.\n\nReproduced with permission of the copyright ouner.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious <span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span> that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\n<span class=\"highlight\">relationship</span>, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032091.jpg": "The Free Press -- Independent News Media - Bob Fitrakis / Gram ro Ahac Page l of 2\nbali vwuta Ny { oo\nTHESEREE®PRESS A) ae\nCapit TRE TM Fir ie #.iEd Wed Dec o7 2oo5 Na it l O4\n. . * P - Pe at\nAbout Doit!
