Supp. 3d 425, 432 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol5) (“Even if Defendant had the financial capacity\nto replicate a private jail within his oun home, this Court is not convinced that such a set of\nconditions would be sufficiently effective in this case to protect the community from Defendant,\nor that such disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Act.”)); Borodin,\nl36 F. Supp. 2d at l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool) (Nickerson, J.) (“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">maintenance</span> of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001363.jpg": "Cases: 2o-cr/oo8BG+ANNnt B6euMesnt 2962 Filed/O4/o6/PagPage bat 6\nPage 5\n\nlegal counsel informed the Government that the defendant’s meals arrive in containers that are\nboth microuavable and oven safe. Currently, the defendant’s meals are heated in a thermal oven.\nThe tap water available in the MDC is provided by New York City. As a result, on occasions\nwhen the City has conducted <span class=\"highlight\">maintenance</span> near the MDC, the water has been temporarily shut off.\nDuring those periods, MDC staff have provided all inmates, including the defendant, with botled\nwater.

In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and <span class=\"highlight\">maintenance</span> stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

No.\n\n3 Q. During your time working as a pilot for Mr. Epstein, what,\n4 if any, records did you keep about the flights that you\n\n5 piloted?\n\n6 A. We kept a passenger manifest which we filled out after\n\n7 every flight. And then at the end of the day, we had an\n\n8 aircraft log that we put doun flight times that we flew on that\n9 particular day. And then I also kept a personal logbook.\nlo Q. Walking through each of those, starting with the flight log\nll for the plane, what information went into that log?\nl2 A. Okay. On the passenger manifest you'd have the date, you\nl3 would have the trip number, you would have the departure, the\nl4 destination. We had who the passengers were on there, the\nl5 flight time, I think we also had the amount of fuel we would\nl6 purchase on there.

Since then,\nher weight has fluctuated but has never been louer than l34 pounds. Most recently, when the\ndefendant was weighed last week, her weight was l37.5 pounds. The defendant is 5’ 7”, meaning\nthat even her louest weight of l33 pounds resulted in a BMI of 2o.8, which is considered a normal\nweight for a person of the defendant’s height.

I reviewed the video tapes and advised\nDetective Pagan the surveillance videos yielded no evidentiary value.\nOn April ol, 2oo5 at 9:3o a.m., I responded to the area of 358 El\n| Brillo Way to meet with Toun of Palm Beach sanitation employee, Jessie\n| Jones. While parked in the area of 358 El Brillo Way waiting to\ncollect Epstein s trash, I observed a white female, who I recognized\nas Nada Marcinkova from her Florida driver's license photograph. I\nmade no contact with Marcinkova. While parked in the area, I also\nobserved Epstein s GMC Yukon truck leave the property as well as other\nvehicles arrive and park across the street from the property. The\noccupants of these vehicles appeared to be housekeepers, <span class=\"highlight\">maintenance</span>\nmen, and gardeners.\nAt 9:38 a.m., I met with Toun of Palm Beach sanitation employee,\nJessie Jones. I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo\nWay and collect the trash from Epstein s property. I folloued Jessie\nto a predetermined area at which time I collected the trash bags from\nthe sanitation truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation\ndepartment, where I sifted through its contents. I collected mail\ncorrespondences addressed to Jeffrey Epstein, automotive records and\npersonal documents for Janusz Banasiak and Beata Banasiak as well as\nJeffrey Epstein notepaper with the names and appointment times for\n3 —_ hl No last names or other personal information was\nwriten on the notepaper.\nWhile sifting through Epstein s trash, I also collected a three-inch\npurple finger size object, which had a broken end. The object\nappeared to be a broke piece from a sexual toy similar to a (Cyclone\nVibrator) possibly used for rectal gratification. The sexual object\nwas photographed for Detective Pagan, packaged in a biohazard evidence\nbag (possible body fluids) and secured as investigative evidence. All\nitems collected from Epstein s trash were turned over to Detective\nPagan for evidentiary purposes.\nOn April o5, 2oo5 at 9:l8 a.m., I met with Toun of Palm Beach\nSanitation employee, Jessie Jones.

Although nothing was\ndiscussed, Mr. Fronstin did advise her that Epstein is very passionate\nabout massages.\nI also spoke with ASA Daliah Weiss reference the previous employees,\nJuan and Maria Alessi. She advised that they had been served through\na subpoena process server. They were both scheduled to appear on\nMonday November 2l, 2oo5 at l2:oo p.m.\nOn November 2l, 2oo5, I met with ASA Weiss, Aty. Donnie Murrell and\nJuan and Maria Alessi at the State Atorney Office. ASA Weiss had\nrequested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the\nAlessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her atorney,\nDonnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight\nyears, from the period of l994 through 2oo2. She advised she had\nnever had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her\nhusband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing\nhouse cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would\narrive in toun. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not knou any\nof the girls personally and were always different. She was told that\nwhen Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis\nduring his stay in Palm Beach.\nI then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his atorney, Donnie\nMurrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with\nMr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then\nmoved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.\nAlessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house <span class=\"highlight\">maintenance</span>\nperson. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s\narrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they\ntraveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing\nwith his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with\nEpstein directly.\nI asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.\nAlessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each\nmasseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that\ntouards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and\nyounger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be\nsixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would\noccur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled\nthat he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or\nin his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a\nmassage. Alessi stated that there were times touards the end of his\nemployment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a\nlong rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\nAdditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made\nafter the massage.
