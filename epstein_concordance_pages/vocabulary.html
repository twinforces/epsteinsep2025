The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\nlaboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">vocabulary</span> of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v. Randall, l9-Cr.-l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335.\n\nFor the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—\nthe Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability\nof Dr. Rocchio’s method.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method\nis unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 84\n” Joseph, 542 F.3d at 2l-22 (first and second alterations in original) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThat point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases.
