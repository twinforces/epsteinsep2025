Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded.

Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">predictors</span> of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental Disorders Associated with Sexual Assault: A\nMeta-Analysis, 2l Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2o), pp. loll-lo28. Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations. Emily R. Dworkin, Anna E.\nJaffe, Michele Bedard-Gilligan, and Skye Fitzpatrick, PTSD in the Year Follouing Sexual\nAssault: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2l)\nhtps://doi.org/lo.ll77/l524838o2llo322l3. A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma. Caron Zlotnick, Meredith Warshaw, et al., Chronicity in Postraumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD) and <span class=\"highlight\">Predictors</span> of Course of Comorbid PTSD in Patients with Anxiety Disorders, l2 J.\nTraumatic Stress (l999), 89-loo.\n\nSymptoms of PTSD include distressing memories of the event; intense or prolonged\npsychological distress at exposure to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic\nevent; marked physiological reactions to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the\ntraumatic event; avoidance or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about\nor closely associated with the traumatic event(s); and avoidance of or efforts to avoid external\nreminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing\nmemories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 27l-272. Individuals with\nany of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or\nfriendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator,\nor to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit\nintense distress.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007928.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 6o of l5959\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">predictors</span> of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental Disorders Associated with Sexual Assault: A\nMeta-Analysis, 2l Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2o), pp. loll-lo28. Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations. Emily R. Dworkin, Anna E.\nJaffe, Michele Bedard-Gilligan, and Skye Fitzpatrick, PTSD in the Year Follouing Sexual\nAssault: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2l)\nhtps://doi.org/lo.ll77/l524838o2llo322l3. A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma. Caron Zlotnick, Meredith Warshaw, et al., Chronicity in Postraumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD) and <span class=\"highlight\">Predictors</span> of Course of Comorbid PTSD in Patients with Anxiety Disorders, l2 J.\nTraumatic Stress (l999), 89-loo.\n\nSymptoms of PTSD include distressing memories of the event; intense or prolonged\npsychological distress at exposure to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic\nevent; marked physiological reactions to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the\ntraumatic event; avoidance or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about\nor closely associated with the traumatic event(s); and avoidance of or efforts to avoid external\nreminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing\nmemories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 27l-272. Individuals with\nany of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or\nfriendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator,\nor to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit\nintense distress.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014935.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 59oofl58 59\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. I wanted to direct your atention to the use of the term\n\n2 grooming, so in that top paragraph. If you could review the\n\n3 section of the article that starts with \"If their use of the\n\n4 term grooming\" and all the way to the end of that paragraph and\n5 let me knou when you have had a chance to review it, please.\n\n6 A. Okay.\n\n7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response, reaction to this\n\n8 passage?\n\n9 A. It's a bit confusing as to the point that's being made. I\nlo feel like they're trying to -- the author here seems to be\n\nll mixing different applications of the term that they use\n\nl2 grooming, so it looks like in part he's talking about what is\nl3 true in the literature, which is that we're not particularly\n\nl4 good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and\nl5 predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we\nl6 can't look at specific behaviors alone as <span class=\"highlight\">predictors</span>.\n\nl7 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is\nl8 used to describe a process, a patern of behaviors. I'm not\n\nl9 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these\n2o particular behaviors, yes, we knou you're a child abuser. So\n2l he's making that point. But I don't think anybody -- I don't\nae think that -- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with\n23 that. Except that he's then going on -- I disagree where he\n24 says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might in\n25 fact be prosocial or normal.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4935\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 8loofl58 8l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl what are some of the <span class=\"highlight\">predictors</span> of delayed disclosure and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed disclosure,\n5 as opposed to adults.
