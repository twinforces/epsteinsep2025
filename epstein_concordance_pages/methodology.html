First, the inactive voters in all counties except Dutchess were excluded from\nselection. Assuming that they should have been considered, this exclusion resulted in the\nsample frame (the voter lists) being improperly defined for all counties except Dutchess. The\nsecond issue is that, of the six counties which make up the White Plains community, three\ncounties feed both the Manhatan and White Plains master jury wheel, while three counties feed\nonly White Plains. The process for selecting for the White Plains master jury wheel from the\nthree non-overlapping counties was to select one out of every three voters, while the process for\nselecting from the three overlapping counties was to select one out of every 4.5 voters.* Thus,\nthe White Plains sampling <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span> underrepresents the voters in the three overlapping\ncounties.°\n\nl4. If the sample from the voter registration lists had been a simple random sample, then\nthe master jury wheel would be expected to mirror that of the voter registration lists as of\nNovember l, 2ol6.

Of course,\nthe master jury wheel could vary from the actual demographics of the community due to\n> There may be some valid reason for excluding inactive voters, but inactive voters from\nDutchess county were included in the selection process, and some inactive voters responded and\nwere on the qualified jury wheel. Thus, I assume that the exclusion of the inactive voters was in\nerror and I explore the impact of this error in explaining any differences between the wheel and\ncommunity demographics.\n\n* The <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span> was to first select the Manhatan wheel by selecting one out of every 3 voters\nfrom each county in the Manhatan community, and then for the overlapping counties to remove\nthose selected for the Manhatan wheel from consideration for the White Plains community and\nthen selecting one out of every 3 of the remaining voters. The result is that, considering all\nvoters in the county, only l out of every 4.5 are selected for the White Plains community.\n> The procedure may have been a compromise between having an overly burdensome process for\nvoters in the overlapping counties whose chances of jury selection would be twice that of voters\nin non-overlapping counties and the underrepresentation of voters in the overlapping counties in\nthe White Plains master jury wheel.\n\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3627\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 3o\nand the more homogeneous the area, the more accurate the geocoding estimate.

Houever, since the master jury\nwheel is selected from registered voters and not from potentially voting-eligible persons, this\nassumes that the likelihood of registering to vote for those who live within the same census tract\nis the same by race and ethnicity. If African Americans and/or Hispanics are less likely to\nregister to vote, the results of the geocoding will overestimate the percent of African Americans\nand Hispanics on the master jury wheel (reason l).

Based on the geocoding, the race and ethnicity representation of the master jury\nwheel is ll.2o% African American and l2.97% Hispanic.

The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o.

See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8.

Because statistical rigor is not a useful method for evaluating the reliability of qualitative\nresearch like Dr. Rocchio’s, statistical tools like error rates are irrelevant to the Daubert analysis.\n\nContrary to the defendant’s next claim, these opinions are not “impregnable for purposes\nof cross examination.” (Def.

The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth.

A few observations are in order:\n\nFirst, the reason we are required to hold a Daubert hearing in this case is that the\ngovernment endorsed an expert to talk about subjects that are not widely accepted by\nqualified experts in the field.

Dietz and Hall, respectively), include hundreds of pages of 35oo material.\n\nFourth, no Daubert hearing would be appropriate for Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus or Dr. Hall.\nEach is well qualified, have been accepted by hundreds of courts as experts, and their\nopinions are based on science, not “trauma clinical” pseudoscience.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellof 4l\n\nA threshold issue is, of course, whether the witness “is qualified to be an ‘expert’” in the\nsubject mater at issue.

Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 589-9o; see Kumho Tire Co., Inc. v. Carmichael, 526\nU.S. l37 (l999).

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed.

To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6 of 29\n\nloo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span> of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lol\n\nThe determination that a report of sexual assault is false can be\n\nmade only if the evidence establishes that no crime was commited or\n\natempted. This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\n<span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span> and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false rape allegation. On March l3, 2oo6, the\nlacrosse team at Duke University hired two exotic dancers, Crystal Magnum\nand Kim Roberts, to perform at a house party (Hemmens, 2oo8). While\nat the house, Magnum fell unconscious for a short while after which an\nexchange of insults occurred between the lacrosse team and the two strip-\npers. Roberts then drove Magnum to a store where she was dropped off.\nAfter being arrested for public drunkenness, Magnum accused three of the\nDuke lacrosse teammates of rape. The allegations were pursued over the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page2ofll\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nThe Court exercises a “gatekeeper function” in assessing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony.

Discussion\n\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defense argues that the additional materials filed by the\nGovernment in support of Dr. Rocchio’s expertise should be excluded as failing to comply with\nthe Court’s order that the Government make all expert witness disclosures by April 23, 2o2l.\nDkt. No. 25o.

Carmichael, 526\nU.S. l37, l52 (l999)). “To decide ‘whether a step in an expert’s analysis is unreliable, the\ndistrict court should undertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies, the\nmethod by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts, and hou the expert applies the\nfacts and methods to the case at hand.’” Electra v. 59 Murray Enterprises, Inc., 987 F.3d 233,\n254 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (quoting Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 267). If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span>, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\nspecialized’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4.

Even were the Court inclined to follou Raymond rather than the cases in this District,\nit should similarly revisit permiting Dr. Rocchio to testify about the opinion at issue if the defense\natacks victim credibility.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span>, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span> or theory behind it.

As Judge Engelmayer explained\nwhen evaluating the testimony of a similar expert in a sex trafficking case, analyzing error rates is\nan “unusually poor fit” in this area:\n\n[S]tudying the circumstances and psychological drivers of trafficked\n\nwomen is not like studying diseases or potential cures in laboratory\n\nanimals. . . .

Because statistical rigor is not a useful method for evaluating the reliability of qualitative\nresearch like Dr. Rocchio’s, statistical tools like error rates are irrelevant to the Daubert analysis.\n\nContrary to the defendant’s next claim, these opinions are not “impregnable for purposes\nof cross examination.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross\nexamination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed.

A at l3-l4). This is plainly inadequate under the rules,\nand the Government cannot litigate the qualifications, reliability, or relevance of unknoun\ntestimony about unidentified documents at this time.\n\nOf course, the Court has the option of permiting the defense to clarify this notice mid-trial\nwhenever the defense receives and reviews the documents they have in mind. Doing so, houever,\nwould almost certainly lead to mid-trial Daubert briefing, possibly a mid-trial Daubert hearing,\nand late-breaking rebutal expert notice by the Government.\n\nThe beter course is to require the defense to identify, immediately, the documents they\nexpect to be the subject of forensic analysis and the precise forensic <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span> that these experts\nwill use to analyze those documents. That may—depending on the details—permit some Daubert\nlitigation to occur nou, because the Government may be able to agree with, or challenge, the notion\nthat these experts are qualified to use the <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span>, that the <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span> is reliable, or that\nthe document is relevant. See, e.g., Jennifer L. Mnookin, “Scripting Expertise: The History of\nHandwriting Identification Evidence and the Judicial Construction of Reliability,” 87 Va. L. Rev.\nl723, l726-27 (2ool) (describing “major pretrial batles being waged over the admissibility of . . .\nexpert evidence in handwriting identification”). !7\n\nHere too, the Court should order the defendant to provide additional expert notice of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span> these experts intend to use, and the precise documents they expect to examine. Such\n'3 Tt would of course defeat the purpose of an order along these lines if the defendant gives expert\nnotice of numerous document examination methodologies, requiring extensive Daubert litigation\nthat may stretch into trial and would far exceed the scope any actual testimony that may be\npresented at trial.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008095.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pageloof 25\n\nInstead of seeking relief under Rule 7o2, the government actually seeks relief under\nRules 4ol and 4o3, with an additional mention of Rule 7o3. None of the government’s\narguments is well taken, houever, if only because, “as with an expert’s qualifications and the\nreliability of his or her <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span>, the liberality of Rule 7o2 insists that ‘doubts about whether\nan expert’s testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility unless\nthere are strong factors such as time or surprise favoring exclusions.’” Washington v.

A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers.

Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008174.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page2ofl7\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nThe Court exercises a “gatekeeper function” in assessing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7). To determine whether an\nexpert’s method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme\nCourt in Daubert, including whether the expert’s method has been tested, whether it has been\nsubjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method’s operation, and\nwhether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d\n259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 593-94\n(l993)).\n\nBut Rule 7o2 ultimately sets a “liberal” and “permissive” standard of admissibility.\nNimely v. City of New York, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 395-96 (2d Cir. 2oo5). In particular, not every expert\nadmissible under Daubert need rely on a method that conforms with “the exactness of hard\nscience methodologies.” E.E.o.C. v.

The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses.

The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. 8 77ol(c)(l)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 l2ol.56(b)(l)(i).\nIn Chapter 2 of this report, we provide background information, including identification and a description of\nsignificant entities and individuals; a summary of our <span class=\"highlight\">methodology</span>; and the applicable laws, federal\nregulations, and BOP policies. In Chapter 3, we outline a timeline of key events. In Chapter 4, we set forth\nour findings of fact relating to the BOP’s custody and care of Epstein before his death. In Chapter 5, we set\nforth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, including Epstein’s death. In Chapter 6,\nwe set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security\ncamera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s\ndeath. Finally, Chapter 7 contains our conclusions and recommendations.\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023373.tif": "referred to as a “round sheet’) falsely stating that she and Thomas had conducted such rounds when, in\nfact, they had not.°\nOn November l9, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\nreturned an indictment that charged Noel and Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple\ncounts each of falsification of records, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, lool(a)(3), and 2. The indictment\nalleged that on August 9, 2ol9, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and lo p.m. counts of inmates\nin the MCC New York SHU, and that on August lo, 2ol9, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the\nmandatory l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 3o-minute rounds within the MCC New York\nSHU. The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, certified, and submited false\ndocumentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to\nperform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU,\nincluding Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9, until approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, when\nEpstein was found hanged in his cell.\nOn May 25, 2o2l, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred\nprosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court\nrecord in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely certified that they had\nconducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely\ndisclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the\nU.S. Atorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete loo hours of\ncommunity service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision\nand their establishment of good behavior. On December l3, 2o2l, after Noel and Thomas successfully\nfulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all\ncharges pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count\nslips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and\nThomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor\njudgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties.\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Methodology</span>\nDuring the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one\noccasion. The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the\nSHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,\nAssociate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC\nNew York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had\n5 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check\nSheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute\nrounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23373\n"};
