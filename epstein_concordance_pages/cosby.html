Defense counsel did not respond.\n\nMost recently, on June 3o, 2o2l, Mr. Markus authored an Op-Ed in the New York Daily\nNews.? The Op-Ed compared the defendant to Bill <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and argued that this case should be\ndismissed in the wake of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s release from prison. The Op-Ed claims that Jeffrey Epstein’s\nnon-prosecution agreement is binding in this District, but that “[t]he trial court, just like the trial\ncourt and intermediate appellate court in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s case, has agreed to let the government out of its\ndeal.” The Op-Ed further claims that this case is “extremely weak” and asserts that “[a] jury should\nreject those flimsy and stale charges.” The Op-Ed also identifies Mr. Markus as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” Other news outlets have subsequently issued articles regarding the Op-Ed.*\n\nB. Relief Is Warranted Under Local Rule 23.l\n\nLocal Rule 23.l generally prohibits extrajudicial statements of opinion that a reasonable\nperson would expect to create “‘a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with\na fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(a).\nThe Rule further provides, in relevant part, that statements of “opinion as to the accused’s guilt or\ninnocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the case” are among those that\n“presumptively involve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with\na fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(d)(7).\nThe Rule applies to all statements made by lawyers “in connection with pending or imminent\ncriminal litigation with which they are associated.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(a). Furthermore, the\nRule provides that the Court “may issue a special order governing such maters as extrajudicial\nstatements by parties and witnesses likely to interfere with the rights of the accused to a fair trial\nby an impartial jury ....” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(h).\n\nMr. Markus is plainly governed by Local Rule 23.l, because he is not only “associated”\nwith this criminal case, but he is also counsel of record in the defendant’s appeals in connection\nwith this mater. Mr. Markus’s comments to the media—most egregiously, the Op-Ed—were\nclearly in violation of Local Rule 23.l.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2, 2o2l\nPage 2\nafter the assault; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil atorneys to pursue financial\ncompensation through a lawsuit against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. (/d. at 9-lo).\nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, which he\nviewed as, and Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would never\nbe prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2 of 8o\n[J-loo-2o2o]\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nMIDDLE DISTRICT\nBAER, C.J., SAYLOR, TODD, DONOHUE, DOUGHERTY, WECHT, MUNDY, JJ.\nCOMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, > No. 39 MAP 2o2o\nAppellee : Appeal from the Order of Superior\n: Court at No. 33l4 EDA 2ol8 dated\n: December lo, 2ol9 Affirming the\nV. : Judgment of Sentence dated\n: September 25, 2ol8 of the\n: Montgomery Court of Common\nWILLIAM HENRY <span class=\"highlight\">COSBY</span> JR., : Pleas, Criminal Division, at No. CP-\n> 46-CR-3932-2ol6\nAppellant :\n: ARGUED: December l, 2o2o\nOPINION\nJUSTICE WECHT DECIDED: June 3o, 2o2l\nIn 2oo5, Montgomery County District Atorney Bruce Castor learned that Andrea\nConstand had reported that William <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> had sexually assaulted her in 2oo4 at his\nCheltenham residence.

In evaluating the\nlikelinood of a successful prosecution of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, the district atorney foresaw difficulties\nwith Constand’s credibility as a witness based, in part, upon her decision not to file a\ncomplaint promptly. D.A.

We granted allouance of appeal here as\nwell to consider the admissibility of that prior bad act evidence pursuant to Pa.R.E. 4o4(b).\nHouever, because our decision on the Castor declination issue disposes of this appeal,\nwe do not address the Rule 4o4(b) claim.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4 of 8o\ninvolved with, the university.

When Constand arrived, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> greeted her, escorted her to a room, and left\nher alone to eat dinner and drink wine. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> later returned, sat next to Constand on a\ncouch, and placed his hand on her thigh.

Soon thereafter, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> invited Constand to return to his home for dinner.\nConstand arrived at the residence and again ate alone, in the same room in which she\nhad eaten during her first visit.

When she leaned forward to prevent him\nfrom doing so, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> immediately ceased his efforts. Constand believed that her actions\nhad communicated to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> clearly that she did not want to engage in a physical\nrelationship with him. She expected that no further incidents like this one would occur.\n\nTouard the end of 2oo3, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> invited Constand to meet at the Foxwoods Casino\nin Connecticut. Constand accepted the invitation and, once at the casino, dined with\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and a casino employee, Tom Cantone. After dinner, Cantone walked Constand\nto her hotel room. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> called Constand and asked her to meet him for dessert in his\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5of 8o\nroom. Constand agreed. When she arrived, she sat on the edge of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s bed as the\ntwo discussed their customary topics: Temple athletics and sports broadcasting. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nthen reclined on the bed next to Constand. Eventually, he drifted off to sleep. After\nremaining in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s room for a few minutes, Constand left and returned to her oun room.\nConstand interpreted <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s actions as another sexual overture. Notwithstanding these\nunwelcome advances, Constand still regarded <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> as a mentor, remained grateful for\nhis career advice and assistance, and did not feel physically threatened or intimidated.4\n\nEventually, Constand decided to leave her job at Temple and return to Canada to\nwork as a masseuse. In January 2oo4, Constand went to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>'s Cheltenham residence\nto discuss that decision. As on her previous visits to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s home, Constand entered\nthrough the kitchen door. On this occasion, houever, Constand noticed that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nalready had placed a glass of water and a glass of wine on the kitchen table. While she\nsat at the table with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and discussed her future, Constand initially chose not to\nsample the wine because she had not yet eaten and did not want to consume alcohol on\nan empty stomach. At <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s insistence, houever, Constand began to drink.\n\nAt one point, Constand rose to use the restroom. When she returned, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was\nstanding next to the kitchen table with three blue pills in his hand. He reached out and\noffered the pills to Constand, telling her that the pills were her “friends,” and that they\nwould “help take the edge off.” Constand took the pills from <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and swalloued them.\nThe two then sat back doun and resumed their discussion of Constand’s planned\ndeparture from Temple.\n\nConstand soon began experiencing double vision. Her mouth became dry and\nshe slurred her speech. Although Constand could not immediately identify the source of\n4 N.T., Trial, 4/l3/2ol8, at 53, 55.\n\n5 N.T., Trial, 4/l3/2ol8, at 59-6o.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004818.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6 of 8o\nher sudden difficulties, she knew that something was wrong. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> tried to reassure her.\nHe told her that she had to relax. When Constand atempted to stand up, she needed\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s assistance to steady herself. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> guided her to a sofa in another room so that\nshe could lie doun. Constand felt weak and was unable to talk. She started slipping out\nof consciousness.\n\nMoments later, Constand came to suddenly, finding <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> siting behind her on\nthe sofa. She remained unable to move or speak. With Constand physically incapable\nof stopping <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> or of telling him to stop, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> began fondling her breasts and\npenetrating her vagina with his fingers. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> then took Constand’s hand and used it to\nmasturbate himself. At some point, Constand lost consciousness.\n\nWhen Constand eventually awakened on <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s couch in the early morning\nhours, she discovered that her pants were unzipped and that her bra was raised and out\nof place. Constand got up, adjusted her clothing, and prepared to leave the residence.\nShe found <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> standing in a doorway, wearing a robe and slippers. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> told\nConstand that there was a muffin and a cup of tea on a table for her. She took a sip of\nthe tea, broke off a piece of the muffin, and left.\n\nAfter the January 2oo4 incident, Constand and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> continued to talk over the\ntelephone about issues involving Temple University athletics. In March of that year,\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> invited Constand to dinner at a Philadelphia restaurant. She accepted the\ninvitation in hopes of confronting <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> about the January episode, but the two did not\ndiscuss that mater during dinner. Afterward, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> invited Constand to his residence.\nShe agreed. Once there, Constand atempted to broach the subject by asking <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to\nidentify the pills that he had provided to her. She then tried to ask him why he took\nadvantage of her when she was under the influence of those pills. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was evasive\nand would not respond directly. Realizing that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was not going to answer her\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7 of 8o\nquestions, Constand got up and left. She did not report to the authorities what <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> had\ndone to her.\n\nA few months later, Constand moved back to her native Canada. She spoke with\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> over the telephone, mostly about an upcoming Toronto performance that he had\nscheduled. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> invited Constand and her family to the shou, which especially excited\nConstand’s mother, who had atended two of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s other performances and who\nbrought a gift for <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to the shou.\n\nConstand kept the January 2oo4 incident to herself for nearly a year, until one night\nin January 2oo5, when she bolted awake crying and decided to call her mother for advice.\nInitially, Constand’s mother could not talk because she was en route to work, but she\nreturned Constand’s call immediately upon arrival. During the call, Constand told her\nmother that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> had sexually assaulted her approximately one year earlier. Together,\nthe two decided that the best course of action was to contact the Durham Regional Police\nDepartment in Ontario, Canada, and to atempt to retain legal counsel in the United\nStates.\n\nThat night, Constand filed a police report with the Durham Regional Police\nDepartment. Shortly thereafter, Constand called <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, but he did not answer his phone.\nWhen <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> returned the call the next day, both Constand and her mother were on the\nline. Constand brought up the January 2oo4 incident and asked <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to identify the\nthree blue pills that he had given to her that night. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> apologized vaguely. As to the\npills, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> feigned ignorance, promising Constand that he would check the label on the\nprescription botle from which they came and relay that information to her.\n\nFrustrated, Constand left the call, but her mother remained on the line and\ncontinued to speak with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> assured Constand’s mother that he did not have\nsexual intercourse with Constand while she was incapacitated.

During this conversation,\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> offered to continue assisting Constand if she still desired to work in sports\nbroadcasting. He also indicated that he would pay for Constand to continue her\neducation. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> asked Constand to meet him in person to discuss these maters further,\nand told her that he would have someone contact her to set up the meeting. As with the\nprevious call, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> again refused to identify the pills that he had provided to Constand\non the night of the alleged assault.\n\nWithin days of filing the police report, Constand received two telephone messages\nfrom people associated with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. The first message was from one of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\nassistants, calling on <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s behalf to invite Constand and her mother to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\nupcoming performance in Miami, Florida. Constand called the representative back and\nrecorded the call. The representative asked for certain details about Constand and her\nmother so that he could book flights and hotel rooms for them. Constand declined the\noffer and did not provide the requested information. Constand then received a message\nfrom one of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s atorneys, who stated that he was calling to discuss the creation of\na trust that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> wanted to set up in order to provide financial assistance for Constand’s\neducation. Constand never returned the atorney’s call.\n\nIn the meantime, the Durham Regional Police Department referred Constand’s\npolice report to the Philadelphia Police Department, which, in turn, referred it to the\nCheltenham Police Department in Montgomery County, where <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s residence was\nlocated. The case was assigned to Sergeant Richard Schaeffer, who worked in tandem\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo482o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 8o\nwith the Montgomery County Detective Bureau and the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office to investigate Constand’s allegation.\n\nSergeant Schaeffer first spoke with Constand by telephone on January l9, 2oo5.\nAccording to Sergeant Schaeffer, Constand seemed nervous throughout this brief initial\ninterview. Thereafter, Constand traveled from Canada to Cheltenham to meet with the\ninvestigating team in person. Because this was Constand’s first time meeting with law\nenforcement personnel, she felt nervous and uncomfortable while discussing with them\nthe intimate nature of her allegations.\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then-Montgomery County District Atorney Bruce Castor\nissued a press release informing the public that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was under investigation for sexual\nassault. Sergeant Schaeffer and other law enforcement officials interviewed <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in\nNew York City, utilizing a writen question and answer format. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was accompanied\nby his atorneys, Walter M. Phillips, Esquire, and John P. Schmit, Esquire. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nreported that Constand had come to his home at least three times during their social and\nromantic relationship. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> claimed that, on the night in question, Constand came to\nhis house complaining of an inability to sleep. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> stated that he told Constand that,\nwhen he travels, he takes Benadryl, an antihistamine, which immediately makes him\ndrousy. According to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, he then handed Constand one-and-a-half Benadryl pills,\nbut did not tell her what they were.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> recalled that, once Constand ingested the pills, they kissed and touched\neach other on the couch. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> admited that he touched Constand’s breasts and vagina,\nbut he insisted that she neither resisted nor told him to stop. Additionally, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> told the\ninvestigators that he never removed his clothing and that Constand did not touch any part\nof his body under his clothes. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> denied having sexual intercourse with Constand\nand disclaimed any intent to do so that night. In fact, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> claimed that the two never\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo482l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 8o\nhad sexual intercourse on any occasion. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> admited that he told Constand and her\nmother that he would write doun the name of the pills and provide them that information,\nbut he acknouledged that he never actually did so. After the interview—and without being\nasked to do so—<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> provided the police with pills, which laboratory testing confirmed\nto be Benadryl.\n\nIn February 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor reviewed Constand’s interviews\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s writen answers in order to assess the viability of a prosecution of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.\nThe fact that Constand had failed to promptly file a complaint against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> troubled the\ndistrict atorney. In D.A. Castor’s view, such a delay diminished the reliability of any\nrecollections and undermined the investigators’ efforts to collect forensic evidence.\nMoreover, D.A. Castor identified a number of inconsistences in Constand’s various\nstatements to investigators. After <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial compensation in\na lawsuit against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a conviction against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A. Castor found these recurring interactions between a complainant and\nan alleged perpetrator to be atypical. D.A. Castor also reasoned that the recordings likely\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4822", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 8o\nwere illegal and included discussions that could be interpreted as atempts by Constand\nand her mother to get <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to pay Constand so that she would not contact the\nauthorities. The totality of these circumstances ultimately led D.A. Castor to conclude\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidence upon which any charge\nagainst [] <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> related to the Constand incident could be proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 6o.\n\nHaving determined that a criminal trial likely could not be won, D.A. Castor\ncontemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some\nform of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not prosecute [] <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64. By removing the threat of a criminal\nprosecution, D.A. Castor reasoned, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would no longer be able in a civil lawsuit to\ninvoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for fear that his statements\ncould later be used against him by the Commonwealth. Mr. Castor would later testify that\nthis was his intent:\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that a person\n\nmay not be compelled to give evidence against themselves. So you can't\n\nsubpoena somebody and make them testify that they did something\n\nillegat—or evidence that would lead someone to conclude they did\n\nsomething illegal—on the threat of if you don’t answer, you'll be subject to\n\nsanctions because you’re under subpoena.\n\nSo the way you remove that from a witness is—if you want to, and what |\n\ndid in this case—is | made the decision as the sovereign that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\n\nwould not be prosecuted no mater what. As a mater of law, that then made\n\nit so that he could not take the Fifth Amendment ever as a mater of law.\n\nSo | have heard banter in the courtroom and in the press the term\n\n“agreement,” but everybody has used the wrong word. | told [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\n\natorney at the time, Walter] Phillips that | had decided that, because of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4823", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 8o\ndefects in the case, that the case could not be won and that | was going to\n\nmake a public statement that we were not going to charge Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.\n\n| told him that | was making it as the sovereign Commonwealth of\n\nPennsylvania and, in my legal opinion, that meant that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would not\n\nbe alloued to take the Fifth Amendment in the subsequent civil suit that\n\nAndrea Constand’s lawyers had told us they wanted to bring.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips agreed with me that that is, in fact, the law of\n\nPennsylvania and of the United States and agreed that if <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was\n\nsubpoenaed, he would be required to testify.\n\nBut those two things were not connected one to the other. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was\n\nnot geting prosecuted at all ever as far as | was concerned. And my belief\n\nwas that, as the Commonwealth and the representative of the sovereign,\n\nthat | had the pouer to make such a statement and that, by doing so, as a\n\nmater of law Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would be unable to assert the Fifth Amendment in\n\na civil deposition.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips, a lawyer of vastly more experience even than me—and\n\n| had 2o years on the job by that point—agreed with my legal assessment.\n\nAnd he said that he would communicate that to the lawyers who were\n\nrepresenting Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in the pending civil suit.\n\nId. at 64-66. Recalling his thought process at the time, the former district atorney further\nemphasized that it was “absolutely” his intent to remove “for all time” the possibility of\nprosecution, because “the ability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.”\nId. at 67.\n\nConsistent with his discussion with Atorney Phillips, D.A. Castor issued another\npress release, this time informing the public that he had decided not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.\nThe press release stated, in full:\n\nMontgomery County District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr. has announced\n\nthat a joint investigation by his office and the Cheltenham Tounship Police\n\nDepartment into allegations against actor and comic Bill <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> is\n\nconcluded. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> maintains a residence in Cheltenham Tounship,\n\nMontgomery County.\n\nA 3l year old female, a former employee of the Athletic Department of\n\nTemple University complained to detectives that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> touched her\n\ninappropriately during a visit to his home in January of 2oo4.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. Detectives\nsearched Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\nthe need arise.

Castor did not communicate to Constand or her counsel his decision to\npermanently forego prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. In fact, Constand did not learn of the decision\nuntil a reporter appeared at one of her civil atorney’s offices later that evening. With the\nresolution of her allegations removed from the criminal courts, Constand turned to the\ncivil realm. On March 8, 2ol5, less than one month after the district atorney’s press\nrelease, Constand filed a lawsuit against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania.®\n\nDuring discovery in that lawsuit, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> sat for four depositions. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>'s atorney\nfor the civil proceedings, John Schmit, had learned about the non-prosecution decision\nfrom <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s criminal counsel, Walter Phillips. From the perspective of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\natorneys, the district atorney’s decision legally deprived <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> of any right or ability to\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, not once during the four depositions did <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment or even mention it. During one deposition, Atorney Schmit\nadvised <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> not to answer certain questions pertaining to Constand, but he did not\nspecifically invoke the Fifth Amendment.’ Nor did <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> claim the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment when asked about other alleged victims of his sexual abuse, presumably\nbecause he believed that he no longer retained that privilege. In fact, no one involved\nwith either side of the civil suit indicated on the record a belief that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> could be\nprosecuted in the future. D.A. Castor’s decision was not included in any writen\nstipulations, nor was it reduced to writing.\n\n6 See Constand v. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, Docket No. 2:o5-cv-olo99-ER.\nt Constand’s atorneys subsequently filed a motion to compel <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to answer.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4826", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l5 of 8o\n\nAt deposition, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> testified that he developed a romantic interest in Constand\nas soon as he met her, but did not reveal his feelings. He acknouledged that he always\ninitiated the in-person meetings and visits to his home. He also stated that he engaged\nin consensual sexual activity with Constand on three occasions, including the January\n2oo4 incident.\n\nThroughout the depositions, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> identified the pills that he provided to Constand\nin 2oo4 as Benadryl. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> claimed to knou the effects of Benadryl well, as he frequently\ntook two of the pills to help himself fall asleep. Thus, when Constand arrived at his house\non the night in question stressed, tense, and having difficulty sleeping, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> decided to\ngive her three half-pills of Benadryl to help her relax. According to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, Constand took\nthe pills without asking what they were, and he did not volunteer that information to her.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> explained that, after fifteen or twenty minutes, he suggested that they move\nfrom the kitchen to the living room, where Constand met him after going to the restroom.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> testified that Constand sat next to him on the couch and they began kissing and\ntouching each other. According to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, they laid together on the couch while he\ntouched her breasts and inserted his fingers into her vagina. Afterwards, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> told her\nto try to get some sleep, and then he went upstairs to his bedroom. He came back\ndounstairs two hours later to find Constand awake. He then escorted her to the kitchen\nwhere they had a muffin and tea.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was questioned about his telephone conversations with Constand’s mother.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> admited that he told Constand and her mother that he would write doun the name\nof the pills that he gave her and then send it to them, but that he failed to do so. He further\nexplained that he would not admit what the pills were over the phone with Constand and\nher mother because he did not want Constand’s mother to think that he was a perverted\nold man who had drugged her daughter. He also noted that he had suspected that the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4827", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l6 of 8o\nphone calls were being recorded. Although he did not believe that Constand was making\nthese allegations in an atempt to get money from him, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> explained that, after\nConstand and her mother confronted him, he offered to pay for her education and asked\nhis atorney to commence discussions regarding seting up a trust for that purpose.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> admited that it would be in his best interests if the public believed that Constand\nhad consented to the encounter, and that he believed he would suffer financial\nconsequences if the public believed that he had drugged and assaulted her.\n\nNotably, during his depositions, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> confessed that, in the past, he had provided\nQualudes®*—not Benadrylto other women with whom he wanted to have sexual\nintercourse.\n\nEventually, Constand setled her civil suit with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> for $3.38 million.’ Initially,\nthe terms of the setlement and the records of the case, including <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s depositions,\nwere sealed. Houever, follouing a media request, the federal judge who presided over\nthe civil suit unsealed the records in 2ol5.\n\nBy that point, then-D.A. Castor had moved on from the district atorney's office and\nwas serving as a Montgomery County Commissioner. He was succeeded as district\natorney by his former first assistant, Risa Vetri Ferman, Esquire.‘° Despite her\npredecessor’s decision not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, upon release of the civil records, District\nAtorney Ferman reopened the criminal investigation of Constand’s allegations.

So you almost certainly knou\n\nthis already. |’m writing to you just in case you might have forgoten what\n\nwe did with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> back in 2oo5. Atached is my opinion from then.\n\nOnce we decided that the chances of prevailing in a criminal case were too\n\nremote to make an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve justice\n\nwas to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would have the best chance\n\nof prevailing in a civil suit against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. With the agreement of [Atorney]\n\nPhillips and [Constand’s] lawyers, | wrote the atached as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending. Again, with the\n\nagreement of the defense lawyer and [Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally\n\nand specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state\n\nprosecution of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in order to remove from him the ability to claim his\n\nFifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing him to\n\nsit for a deposition under oath. [Atorney Phillips] was speaking for <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\n\nside at the time, but he was in contact with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s civil lawyers who did\n\nnot deal with me directly that | recall. | only discovered today that [Atorney\n\nPhillips] had died. But those lawyers representing [Constand] civilly, whose\n\nnames | did not remember until | saw them in recent media accounts, were\n\npart of this agreement because they wanted to make <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> testify. |\n\nbelieved at the time that they thought making him testify would solidify their\n\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the Commonwealth) to\n\npromise not to prosecute him. So in effect, that is what | did. | never made\n\nan important decision without discussing it with you during your tenure as\n\nFirst Assistant.\n\nKnouing the above, | can see no possibility that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s deposition could\n\nbe used in a state criminal case, because | would have to testify as to what\n\nhappened, and the deposition would be subject to suppression. | cannot\n\" Mr. Steele has since been elected District Atorney of Montgomery County.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4829", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 8o\nbelieve any state judge would allou that deposition into evidence, nor\nanything derived therefrom. In fact, that was the specific intent of all parties\ninvolved including the Commonwealth and the plaintiff's lawyers. Knouing\nthis, unless you can make out a case without that deposition and without\nanything the deposition led you to, | think <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would have an action\nagainst the County and maybe even against you personally. That is why |\nhave publically suggested looking for lies in the deposition as an alternative\nnou that we have learned of all these other victims we did not knou about\nat the time we had made the go, no-go decision on arresting <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. |\npublically suggested that the DA in California might try a common plan\nscheme or design case using [Constand’s] case as part of the res gestae in\ntheir case. Because | knew Montgomery County could not prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nfor a sexual offense, if the deposition was needed to do so. But | thought\nthe DA in California might have a shot because | would not have the pouer\nto bind another state’s prosecutor.\n\nSome of this, of course, is my opinion and using <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s deposition in the\n\nCA case, might be a stretch, but one thing is fact: the Commonwealth,\n\ndefense, and civil plaintiffs lawyers were all in the agreement that the\n\natached decision from me stripped <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> of this Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination, forcing him to be deposed. That led to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\npaying [Constand] a lot of money, a large percentage of which went to her\nlawyers on a contingent fee basis. In my opinion, those facts will render\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s deposition inadmissible in any prosecution in Montgomery County\n\nfor the incident that occurred in January 2oo4 in Cheltenham Tounship.\n\nBruce\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

Ferman asserted that, despite the public press release,\nthis was the first she had learned about a binding understanding between the\nCommonwealth and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. She requested a copy of any writen agreement not to\nprosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. D.A. Castor replied with the follouing email:\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that we would not\n\nprosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. That was what the lawyers for [Constand] wanted and |\n\nagreed. The reason | agreed and the plaintiffs lawyers wanted it in writing\n\nis so that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> could not take the 5th Amendment to avoid being deposed\n\nor testifying. A sound strategy to employ. That meant to all involved,\n\nincluding <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s lawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> said in\n\nthe civil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution for\n\nthe event we had him under investigation for in early 2oo5. | signed the\n\npress release for precisely this reason, at the request of [Constand’s]\n\ncounsel, and with the acquiescence of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s counsel, with full and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo483o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 8o\ncomplete intent to bind the Commonwealth that anything <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> said in the\n\ncivil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing him to be deposed\n\nand perhaps testify in a civil trial without him having the ability to “take the\n\n5th” | decided to create the best possible environment for [Constand] to\n\nprevail and be compensated. By signing my name as District Atorney and\n\nissuing the atached, | was “signing off’ on the Commonwealth not being\n\nable to use anything <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> said in the civil case against him in a criminal\n\nprosecution, because | was stating the Commonwealth will not bring a case\n\nagainst <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> for this incident based upon then-available evidence in order\n\nto help [Constand] prevail in her civil action. Evidently, that strategy worked.\n\nThe atached, which was on leterhead and signed by me as District\n\nAtorney, the concept approved by [Constand’s] lawyers was a “writen\n\ndeclaration” from the Atorney for the Commonwealth there would be no\n\nprosecution based on anything <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> said in the civil action. Naturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> said, or anything\n\nderived from what <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> said, | believed then and continue to believe that\n\na prosecution is not precluded.\n\nId., Exh. D-7.\n\nDespite her predecessor’s concerns, D.A. Ferman and the investigators pressed\nforward, reopening the criminal case against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. Members of the prosecutorial team\ntraveled to Canada and met with Constand, asking her to cooperate with their efforts to\nprosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, even though she had specifically agreed not to do so as part of the civil\nsetlement. Investigators also began to identify, locate, and interview other women that\nhad claimed to have been assaulted by <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.\n\nNearly a decade after D.A. Castor’s public decision not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, the\nCommonwealth charged <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> with three counts of aggravated indecent assault’?\nstemming from the January 2oo4 incident with Constand in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>'s Cheltenham\nresidence. On January ll, 2ol6, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus‘?\nie By this time, Mr. Steele had replaced Judge Ferman as District Atorney. See l8\nPa.C.S. § 3l25(a)(l), (a)(4), and (a)(5).\n\ni <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> styled the petition as a “Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Motion to\nDisqualify the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office.” The trial court treated the\nomnibus motion as three separate motions: (l) a motion to dismiss the charges based\nupon the alleged non-prosecution agreement; (2) a motion to dismiss the charges based\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo483l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2o of 8o\nseeking, inter alia, dismissal of the charges based upon the former D.A. Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2l of 8o\nLikewise, he did not recall the specific statement, “[i]n Pennsylvania we\ncharged people for criminal conduct. We don’t charge people with making\na mistake or doing something foolish;” houever, he indicated that it is a true\nstatement.\n\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] gave a full statement to law\nenforcement and his Pennsylvania and New York homes were searched.\n[<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] was accompanied by counsel and did not invoke the Fifth\nAmendment at any time during the statement. After [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>'s] interview,\nMs. Constand was interviewed a second time. Mr. Castor never personally\nmet with Ms. Constand. Follouing that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.\nCastor spoke to [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] atorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told\nMr. Castor that during the year between the assault and the report, Ms.\nConstand had multiple phone contacts with [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]. Mr. Phillips was also\nconcerned that Ms. Constand had recorded phone calls with [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]. Mr.\nPhillips told Mr. Castor that if he obtained the phone records and the\nrecorded calls he would conclude that Ms. Constand and her mother were\natempting was to get money from [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] so they would not go to the\npolice. While he did not necessarily agree with the conclusions Mr. Phillips\nthought would be drawn from the records, Mr. Castor directed the police to\nobtain the records. Mr. Castor’s recollection was that there was an\n“inordinate number of [phone] contacts” between [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] and Ms. Constand\nafter the assault. He also confirmed the existence of at least two “wire\ninterceptions,” which he did not believe would be admissible.\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, allegations made by other women were\nalso investigated. Mr. Castor delegated that investigation to Ms. Ferman.\nHe testified that he determined that, in his opinion, these allegations were\nunreliable.\nFollouing approximately one month of investigation, Mr. Castor concluded\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidenced upon which\nany charge against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> related to the Constand incident could be\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt.” He testified that he could either leave\nthe case open at that point or definitively close the case to allou a civil case.\nHe did not believe there was a chance that the criminal case could get any\nbeter. He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that\ncould not be overcome.\nMr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in\nexchange for Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> not being prosecuted.” Mr. Castor testified that he\ntold Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the\nanalysis and directed her to contact Constand’s atorneys. He testified that\nshe was to contact the atorneys to let them knou that “<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was not going\nto be prosecuted and that the purpose for that was that | wanted to create\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4833", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 8o\nthe atmosphere or the legal conditions such that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would never be\nalloued to assert the Fifth Amendment in the civil case.” He testified that\nshe did not come back to him with any objection from Ms. Constand’s\natorneys and that any objection from Ms. Constand’s atorneys would not\nhave matered anyway. He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]\ncould be sustained. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 8o\nless than flatering light,” as a threat to Ms. Constand and her atorneys\nshould they atack his office. In a 2ol6 Philadelphia Inquirer article, in\nreference to this same sentence, Castor stated, “I put in there that if any\nevidence surfaced that was admissible | would revisit the issue. And\nevidently, that is what the D.A. is doing.” He testified that he remembered\nmaking that statement but that it referred to the possibility of a prosecution\nbased on other victims in Montgomery County or perjury.\n\nHe testified that the press release was intended for three audiences, the\nmedia, the greater legal community, and the litigants. He testified about\nwhat meaning he hoped that each audience would glean from the press\nrelease. He did not intend for any of the three groups to understand the\nentirety of what he meant. The media was to understand only that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]\nwould not be arrested. Lawyers would parse every word and understand\nthat he was saying there was enough evidence to arrest [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] but that\nMr. Castor thought the evidence was not credible or admissible. The third\naudience was the litigants, and they were to understand that they did not\nwant to damage the civil case. He then stated that the litigants would\nunderstand the entirety of the press release, the legal community most of it\nand the press litle of it.\nMr. Castor testified that in November of 2ol4 he was contacted by the\nmedia as a result of a joke a comedian made about [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]. Again, in the\nsummer of 2ol5 after the civil depositions were released, media\napproached Mr. Castor. He testified that he told every reporter that he\nspoke to in this time frame that the reason he had declined the charges was\nto strip Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> of his Fifth Amendment privilege. He testified that he did\nnot learn the investigation had been reopened until he read in the paper that\n[<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] was arrested in December 2ol5, but there was media speculation\nin September 2ol5 that an arrest might be imminent.\nOn September 23, 2ol5, apparently in response to this media speculation,\nunprompted and unsolicited, Mr. Castor sent an email to then District\nAtorney Risa Vetri Ferman. His email indicated, in pertinent part,\n\nI’m writing you just in case you might have forgoten what we\n\ndid with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> back in 2oo5. .. Once we decided that the\n\nchances of prevailing in a criminal case were too remote to\n\nmake an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve\n\njustice was to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would\n\nhave the best chance of prevailing in a civil suit against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.\n\nWith the agreement of [Atorney Phillips] and [Constand’s]\n\nlawyer, | wrote the atached [press release] as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending.\n\nAgain, with the agreement of the defense lawyer and\n\n[Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally and specifically bound the\n\nCommonwealth that there would be no state prosecution of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4835", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 8o\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in order to remove from him the ability to claim his Fifth\nAmendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing\nhim to sit for a deposition under oath. ... But those lawyers\nrepresenting [Constand] civilly . .. were part of this agreement\nbecause they wanted to make <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> testify. | believed at the\ntime that they thought making him testify would solidify their\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the\nCommonwealth) to promise not to prosecute him. So in effect,\nthat is what | did. | never made an important decision without\ndiscussing it with you during your tenure as First Assistant.\n\n[B]ut one thing is fact. The Commonwealth, defense and civil\n\nplaintiff's lawyers were all in agreement that the atached\n\ndecision from me stripped <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> of his Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination forcing him to be deposed.\nHe indicated in his email that he learned Mr. Phillips had died on the date\nof his email. The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject\nto suppression.\nMs. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by leter of September 25,\n2ol5, requesting a copy of the “writen declaration” indicating that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]\nwould not be prosecuted. In her leter, Ms. Ferman indicated that “[t]he first\n| heard of such a binding agreement was your email sent this past\nWednesday. The first | heard of a writen declaration documenting the\nagreement not to prosecute was authored on 9/24/l5 and published today\nby Margaret Gibbons of the Intelligencer. ... We have been in contact with\ncounsel for both Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and Ms. Constand and neither has provided us\nwith any information about such an agreement.”\nMr. Castor responded by email. His email indicated,\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that\n\nwe would not prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. That was what the lawyers\n\nfor the plaintiffs wanted and | agreed. The reason | agreed\n\nand the plaintiff's wanted it in writing was so <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> could not\n\ntake the 5\" Amendment to avoid being deposed or\n\ntestifying. ... That meant to all involved, including <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\n\nlawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> said in the\n\ncivil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal\n\nprosecution for the event we had him under investigation for\n\nin early 2oo5. | signed the press release for precisely this\n\nreason, at the request of Plaintiff's counsel, and with the\n\nacquiescence of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s counsel, with full and complete\n\nintent to bind the Commonwealth that anything <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> said in\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4836", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 8o\n\nthe civil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing\n\nhim to be deposed and perhaps testify in a civil trial without\n\nthe ability to “take the 5.” | decided to create the best\n\npossible environment for the Plaintiff to prevail and be\n\ncompensated.

In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First Assistant District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the Commonwealth or anyone representing [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] would never be prosecuted. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution. Ms. Troiani had not receive any prior\nnotification of the decision not to prosecute.\nMs. Constand and her atorneys did not request a declaration from Mr.\nCastor that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] would not be prosecuted. Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] atempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] asserted the Fifth\nAmendment, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider. Ms. Constand and her counsel had no\nreason to request immunity. At no time during the civil suit did Ms. Troiani\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4837", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 8o\nreceive any information in discovery or from [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] atorneys indicating\nthat [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] could never be prosecuted.\n\nMs. Troiani testified that she understood the press release to say that Mr.\nCastor was not prosecuting at that time but if additional information arose,\nhe would change his mind. She did not take the language, “District Atorney\nCastor cautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision\nshould the need arise,” to be a threat not to speak publicly. She continued\nto speak to the press; Mr. Castor did not retaliate.\nMs. Troiani was present for [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] depositions. At no point during the\ndepositions was there any mention of an agreement or promise not to\nprosecute. In her experience, such a promise would have been put on the\nrecord at the civil depositions. She testified that during the four days of\ndepositions, [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] was not cooperative and the depositions were\nextremely contentious. Ms. Troiani had to file motions to compel [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s]\nanswers. [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] refusal to answer questions related to Ms. Constand’s\nallegations formed the basis of a motion to compel. When Ms. Troiani\natempted to question [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] about the allegations, [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] atorneys\nsought to have his statement to police read into the record in lieu of cross\nexamination.\nMs. Troiani testified that one of the initial provisions [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] wanted in the\ncivil setlement was a release from criminal liability. [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s civil atorney\nPatrick] O’Conner’s leter to Ms. Ferman does not dispute this fact. [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]\nand his atorneys also requested that Ms. Troiani agree to destroy her file,\nshe refused. Eventually, the parties agreed on the language that Ms.\nConstand would not initiate any criminal complaint. The first Ms. Troiani\nheard of a promise not to prosecute was in 2ol5. The first Ms. Kivitz learned\nof the purported promise was in a 2ol4 newspaper article.\nJohn P. Schmit, Esq., testified that he has represented [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] since l983.\nIn the early l99os, he became [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] general counsel. In 2oo5, when\nhe became aware of the instant allegations, he retained criminal counsel,\nWilliam Phillips, Esq., on [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] behalf. Mr. Phillips dealt directly with\nthe prosecutor’s office and would then discuss all maters with Mr. Schmit.\n[<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] January 2oo5 interview took place at Mr. Schmit’s office. Both\nMr. Schmit and Mr. Phillips were present for the interview. Numerous\nquestions were asked the answers to which could lead to criminal charges.\nAt no time during his statement to police did [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] invoke the Fifth\nAmendment or refuse to answer questions. Mr. Schmit testified that he had\ninterviewed [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] prior to his statement and was not concerned about his\nanswers. Within weeks of the interview, the District Atorney declined to\nbring a prosecution. Mr. Schmit testified that Mr. Phillips told him that the\ndecision was an irrevocable commitment that District Atorney Castor was\nnot going to prosecute [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]. He received a copy of the press release.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 25\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4838", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 27 of 8o\n\nOn March 8, 2oo5, Ms. Constand filed her civil suit and Mr. Schmit retained\n\nPatrick O’Conner, Esq., as civil counsel. Mr. Schmit participated in the civil\n\ncase. [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] sat for four days of depositions. Mr. Schmit testified that\n\n[<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] did not invoke the Fifth Amendment in those depositions and that\n\nhe would not have let him sit for the depositions if he knew the criminal case\n\ncould be reopened.\n\nHe testified that generally he does try to get agreements on [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] behalf\n\nin writing. During this time period, Mr. Schmit was involved in writen\n\nnegotiations with the National Enquirer. He testified that he relied on the\n\npress release, Mr. Castor’s word and Mr. Phillips’ assurances that what Mr.\n\nCastor did was sufficient. Mr. Schmit did not personally speak to Mr. Castor\n\nor get the assurance in writing. During the depositions, Mr. O’Conner\n\nobjected to numerous questions. At the time of the depositions, Mr. Schmit,\n\nthrough his negotiations with the National Enquirer, learned that there were\n\nJane Doe witnesses making allegations against [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>]. [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] did not\n\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege when asked about these other women.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that he had not formed an opinion as to whether Mr.\n\nCastor’s press release would cover that testimony.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that during negotiations of the setlement agreement\n\nthere were references to a criminal case. The setlement agreement\n\nindicated that Ms. Constand would not initiate a criminal case against Mr.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. Mr. Schmit did not come forward when he learned the District\n\nAtorney’s office re-opened the case in 2ol5.\n\nT.C.O. at 47-6l (cleaned up).\n\nNotably, when District Atorney Castor decided not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, he\n“absolutely” intended to remove “for all time” the possibility of prosecution, because “the\nability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67.\nThe trial court sought clarification from Mr. Castor about his statement in his second email\nto D.A. Ferman that he still believed that a prosecution was permissible as long as\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s depositions were not used in such proceedings. Former D.A. Castor explained\nto the court that he meant that a prosecution may be available only if other victims were\ndiscovered, with charges related only to those victims, and without the use of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\ndepositions in the Constand mater. Specifically, former D.A. Castor stated that what he\nwas “trying to convey to Mrs. Ferman [was that his] binding of the Commonwealth not to\nprosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was not for any crime in Montgomery County for all time. It was only\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4839", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 28 of 8o\nfor the sexual assault crime in the Constand case.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 224-25. He\ncontinued, “[s]o if they had evidence that some of these other women had been sexually\nassaulted at <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s home in Cheltenham, then | thought they could go ahead with the\nprosecution of that other case with some other victim, so long as they realized they could\nnot use the Constand deposition and anything derived therefrom.” /d.\n\nAs noted, the trial court denied the motion, finding that then-D.A. Castor never, in\nfact, reached an agreement with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, or even promised <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> that the Commonwealth\nwould not prosecute him for assaulting Constand. T.C.O. at 62. Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the interaction between the former district atorney and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court\nnoted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s\nimmunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947.4 Per the terms of the statute,\na The immunity statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in\n\nall proceedings before:\n\n(l) Courts.\n\n(b) Request and issuance.--The Atorney General or a district atorney\n\nmay request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and\n\nthat judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the Atorney\n\nGeneral or district atorney:\n\n(l) the testimony or other information from a witness may be\nnecessary to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide\nother information on the basis of his privilege against self-\nincrimination.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 29 of 8o\npermission from a court is a prerequisite to any offer of transactional immunity. See id.\n§ 5947(b) (“The Atorney General or a district atorney may request an immunity order\nfrom any judge of a designated court.”). Because D.A. Castor did not seek such\npermission, and instead acted of his oun volition, the trial court concluded that any\npurported immunity offer was defective, and thus invalid. Consequently, according to the\ntrial court, the “press release, signed or not, was legally insufficient to form the basis of\nan enforceable promise not to prosecute.” T.C.O. at 62.\n\nThe trial court also found that “Mr. Castor’s testimony about what he did and hou\nhe did it was equivocal at best.” /d. at 63. The court deemed the former district atorney's\ncharacterization of his decision-making and intent to be inconsistent, inasmuch as he\ntestified at times that he intended transactional immunity, while asserting at other times\nthat he intended use and derivative-use immunity. The trial court specifically credited\nAtorney Troiani’s statements that she never requested that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> be provided with\nimmunity and that she did not specifically agree to any such offer.\n\n(c) Order to testify.--WWhenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in\n\na proceeding specified in subsection (a), and the person presiding at such\n\nproceeding communicates to the witness an immunity order, that witness\n\nmay not refuse to testify based on his privilege against self-incrimination.\n\n(d) Limitation on use.--No testimony or other information compelled under\n\nan immunity order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such\n\ntestimony or other information, may be used against a witness in any\n\ncriminal case, except that such information may be used:\n(l) in a prosecution under l8 Pa.C.S. § 49o2 (relating to perjury) or\nunder l8 Pa.C.S. § 49o3 (relating to false swearing);\n(2) in a contempt proceeding for failure to comply with an immunity\norder; or\n(3) as evidence, where otherwise admissible, in any proceeding\nwhere the witness is not a criminal defendant.\n42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(a)-(d).\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3o of 8o\n\nAs further support for the view that no agreement was reached, nor any promise\nextended, the trial court noted that, in his initial statement to police, which was voluntarily\nprovided and not under oath, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. Instead,\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> presented a narrative of a consensual sexual encounter with Constand, which he\nasserted again later in his depositions. “Thus,” the trial court explained, “there was\nnothing to indicate that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] cooperation would cease if a civil case were filed.” /d.\nat 65. Since <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> previously had discussed the incident without invoking his right to\nremain silent, the court found no reason to believe that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> subsequently would do so\nin a civil case so as to necessitate the remedy that the former district atorney purported\nto provide in anticipation of that litigation.\n\nThe trial court further held that, even if there was a purported grant of immunity,\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> could not insist upon its enforcement based upon the contractual theory of\npromissory estoppel, because “any reliance on a press release as a grant of immunity\nwas unreasonable.” /d. Specifically, the court noted that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was represented at all\ntimes by a competent team of atorneys, but none of them “obtained [D.A.] Castor’s\npromise in writing or memorialized it in any way.” /d. at 65-66. The failure to demand\nwriten documentation was evidence that no promise not to prosecute was ever extended.\nFor these reasons, the trial court found no legal basis to estop the Commonwealth from\nprosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> filed a notice of appeal and a petition for review with the Superior Court. In\nresponse to the filings, the Superior Court temporarily stayed the proceedings belou.\nHouever, upon a motion by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court quashed the appeal\nand lifted the stay. This Court likewise rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s pre-trial efforts to appeal the\nadverse rulings, denying his petition for allouance of appeal, his petition for review, and\nhis emergency petition for a stay of the proceedings.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4842", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s charges were held\nfor trial.

Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth\nwould introduce portions of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s deposition testimony against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> opposed by writen response. The\nCommonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted\ndue to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2ol7, the trial court\ngranted the Commonwealth’s motion, but permited only one of these alleged past victims\nto testify at <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s trial.\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol6, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.\nThe trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be\nl8 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur\nDefendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 58l(l), l2/5/2ol6,\nat 5).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4843", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 32 of 8o\nselected from a different county. Thus, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s jury was selected from residents of\nAllegheny County, and trial commenced. On June l7, 2ol7, after seven days of\ndeliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The trial\ncourt dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial.\n\nAhead of the second trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion seeking to introduce\nthe testimony of a number of additional women who offered to testify about <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s prior\nacts of sexual abuse. Generally, the women averred that, in the l98os, each had an\nencounter with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> that involved either alcohol, drugs, or both, that each became\nintoxicated or incapacitated after consuming those substances, and that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> engaged\nin some type of unwanted sexual contact with each of them while they were unable to\nresist. The dates of the conduct that formed the basis of these allegations ranged from\nl982 to l989, approximately fifteen to twenty-two years before the incident involving\nConstand. Again, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> opposed the motion. Follouing oral argument, and despite\nthere being no change in circumstances other than the first jury’s inability to reach a\nunanimous verdict, the trial court granted the Commonwealth’s motion in part, increasing\nthe number of prior bad acts witnesses alloued at trial from one to five. The selection of\nthe five witnesses from a pool of at least nineteen women was left entirely to the\nCommonwealth.\n\nThe Commonwealth selected, and introduced testimony at <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s second trial\nfrom, the follouing women:\n\nJanice Baker-Kinney. |n l982, Baker-Kinney worked at a Harrah’s Casino in\nReno, Nevada. During that year, a friend invited her to a party that, unbeknounst to her,\nwas being held at a temporary residence used by <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in Reno.

At one point she came to on a bed only to find <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> forcing his penis\ninto her mouth. She passed out and awoke later feeling sick.\n\nChelan Lasha. Lasha met <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in l986, while she was working as an actress\nand model. She was only seventeen years old. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was forty-eight. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> called her\nat her home, and later visited her there. Lasha then sent him modeling shots and spoke\nwith him a number of times on the phone about her career. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> invited her to meet\nhim in Las Vegas, where, he told her, someone would take beter pictures of her. He\nimplied that she could get a role on “The <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> Shou.” Enticed by the prospect, Lasha\nwent to Las Vegas. As promised, once there, someone took pictures of her. Someone\nelse gave her a massage. Eventually, Lasha was alone with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. He gave her a blue\npill, which he said was an antihistamine that would help with a cold from which she was\nsuffering. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> also provided her with a shot of liquor.

Lasha began to feel intoxicated. Lasha was unable to move\non her oun, and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> helped her to the bed. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> laid next to her, pinched her breasts,\nand rubbed his genitals against her leg until she felt something warm on her leg. Lasha\nwoke up the next day wearing only a robe.\n\nMaud Lise-Lote Lublin. When <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> met Lublin in l989, he was fifty-two years\nold, and she was twenty-three. Lublin also was an aspiring model and actress. Lublin’s\nagent informed her that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> wanted to meet her. Soon after, Lublin met with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>,\nwho told her that he would refer her to a modeling agency in New York City. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> then\nstarted to call her regularly. Lublin considered <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to be a mentor and a father figure.\nOnce, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> invited her to his hotel, where they talked about improvisation. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\npoured her a shot of liquor and told her to drink it. Not normally a drinker, Lublin initially\ndeclined the shot. When <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> insisted, she drank it. He poured her another shot, and\nagain strongly encouraged her to drink it. Because she trusted him, Lublin drank the\nsecond shot as well. She quickly felt dizzy and unstable, and was unable to stand on her\noun. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> asked her to sit between his legs and lean against his chest. He stroked her\nhair and talked, but she could not hear his words. She could not move or get up. She\nawoke two days later at her home, with no idea hou she got there.\n\nThe trial court rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s arguments that the introduction of testimonies from\nthe five prior bad acts witnesses violated his due process rights, and that the incidents\nwere too remote in time and too dissimilar to have probative value, let alone probative\nvalue sufficient to overcome the unduly prejudicial impact of such evidence. The court\nnoted that prior bad acts evidence generally cannot be used to establish a criminal\npropensity or to prove that the defendant acted in conformity with the past acts, but that\nsuch evidence can be used to shou motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4847", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 36 of 8o\nknouledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, so long as the probative value of\nthe evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\"° The court then determined that the\ntestimony of the five prior bad act witnesses—and the deposition testimony pertaining to\nthe prior use of Qualudes—was admissible to demonstrate <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s common plan,\nscheme, or design. The trial court reasoned that the similarity and distinctiveness of the\ncrimes bore a logical connection to Constand’s allegations, and amounted to a “signature\nof the same perpetrator.”'’ Comparing the past and present allegations, the court noted\nthat each woman was substantially younger than <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and physically fit; that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\ninitiated the contact with each woman, primarily though her employment; that each\nwoman came to trust <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and view him as a friend or mentor; that each woman\naccepted an invitation to a place that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> controlled; that each woman consumed a\ni T.C.O. 96-97 (citing Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)).

These “chilling\nsimilarities,” the court explained, rendered <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s actions “so distinctive as to become\na signature,” and therefore the evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan,\nscheme, or design. /d. at lo4.\n\nThe court further determined that the prior bad acts evidence was admissible to\ndemonstrate that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s actions were not the result of mistake or accident. The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were proffered as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the conclusion that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] found himself in this situation more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d. Accordingly, “the fact that numerous other women recounted the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4849", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 38 of 8o\nsame or similar story, further supports the admissibility of this evidence under the doctrine\nof chances.” /d.\n\nThe trial court recognized that the alleged assaults upon the prior bad acts\nwitnesses were remote in time, but it explained that remoteness “is but one factor that the\ncourt should consider.” /d. at 97. The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\nsimilarity of the other crimes or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 359). Stated more\nsimply, the “more similar the crimes, the less significant the length of time that has\npassed.” /d.at 98 (citing Commonwealth v. Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. l996)).\nThe court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the prior\nincidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses\noccurred relatively close in time to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly identical similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt). Evidence “will not be prohibited merely because it is\nharmful to the defendant,” and a court “is not required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all\nunpleasant facts.” /d. at loo-ol (quoting Commonwealth v. Conte, l98 A.3d ll69, ll8o-\n8l (Pa. Super. 2ol8)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between\nConstand’s claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,\nparticularly because the court believed that the Commonwealth had a “substantial need”\nfor the evidence. /d. at lo9. “Where the parties agreed that the digital penetration\noccurred, the evidence of other acts was necessary to rebut [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] characterization of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 39 of 8o\n\nthe assault as a consensual encounter.” /d. “Furthermore,” the court opined, “Ms.\nConstand did not report the assault until approximately one year later, further supporting\nthe Commonwealth’s need for the evidence.” /d. at llo. With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d. The court\nnoted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but\nlimited the number to five so as to mitigate the prejudice to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. The court added that\nit gave cautionary instructions on the permissible use of this evidence, designed so as to\nlimit its prejudicial impact. /d. at llo-ll.\n\nFinally, the trial court rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents\nof his deposition testimony to the extent that it concerned his use of Qualudes in decades\npast. The court opined that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s “oun words about his use and knouledge of drugs\nwith a depressant effect was relevant to shou his intent and motive in giving a depressant\nto [] Constand.” /d. at ll5. Because the evidence demonstrated <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s knouledge of\nthe effects of drugs such as Qualudes, the court reasoned, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> “either knew\n[Constand] was unconscious, or recklessly disregarded the risk that she could be.” /d.\nAs with the Rule 4o4(b) witnesses, the court found that any prejudicial effect of this\nevidence was mitigated by the court’s cautionary instructions. /d. Accordingly, the court\ntrial opined that all of the Rule 4o4(b) evidence was admissible.\n\nAt the conclusion of a second jury trial, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was convicted on all three counts of\naggravated indecent assault. Follouing the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the\ntrial court deemed <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-\napplicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA’), 42\nPa.C.S. §§ 9799.lo-9799.4l.

He filed post-sentence motions\nseeking a new trial and a modification of his sentence, which were denied.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> timely filed a notice of appeal, prompting the trial court to order him to file a\nconcise statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. l925\\(b).\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> complied. On May l4, 2ol9, the trial court responded to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s concise\nstatement with its opinion, issued pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. l925(a).\n\nA unanimous panel of the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence in all\nrespects. Commonwealth v. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, 224 A.3d 372 (Pa. Super. 2ol9). The Superior Court\nbegan by assessing <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s challenge to the admissibility of the prior bad acts evidence\nunder Rule 4o4(b). The panel observed that a reviewing court must evaluate the\nadmission of evidence pursuant to the abuse-of-discretion standard. /d. at 397.\nAddressing the trial court’s rationale regarding the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence\ndemonstrating a common plan, scheme, or design, the panel noted that the exception\naims to establish a perpetrator’s identity based upon “his or her commission of\nextraordinarily similar criminal acts on other occasions. The exception is demanding in\nit{s] constraints, requiring nearly unique factual circumstances in the commission of a\ncrime, so as to effectively eliminate the possibility that it could have been commited by\nanyone other than the accused.” /d. at 398 (citing Commonwealth v. Miller, 664 A.2d\nl3lo, l3l8 (Pa. l995)). Although the common plan, scheme, or design rationale typically\nis used to establish the identity of a perpetrator of a particular crime, the Superior Court\npointed out that courts previously have also used the exception “to counter [an]\nanticipated defense of consent.” /d. (quoting Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 36l).\n\nIn Tyson, Jermeel Omar Tyson brought food to his victim, who was feeling ill.\nTyson, ll9 A.3d at 356.

But, when she fell asleep a second time, he resumed\nthe uninvited sexual contact.

The\nDelaware victim similarly was casually acquainted with Tyson, invited Tyson into her\nhome, was in a compromised state, and awoke to find Tyson engaged in vaginal\nintercourse with her. /d. at 357. The trial court declined to admit the Rule 4o4(b) evidence\nagainst Tyson. /d. at 356. On interlocutory appeal, the Superior Court reversed the trial\ncourt’s decision, finding that the proffered evidence was admissible. /d. at 363. The court\nreasoned that the “relevant details and surrounding circumstances of each incident further\nreveal criminal conduct that is sufficiently distinctive to establish [that Tyson] engaged in\nacommon plan or scheme.” /d. at 36o.'° Notably, the Tyson Court found the twelve-year\ngap between Tyson’s Delaware conviction and the offense at issue to be “less important”\nwhen compared to the strength of the similarities between the crimes. /d. at 36l.\n\nWith Tyson in mind, the Superior Court turned its atention to the case sub judice.\nBased upon the similarities between Constand’s allegations and those of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s other\naccusers identified by the trial court, the Superior Court agreed that the accounts of the\nie The en banc majority opinion in Tyson was authored by then-President Judge\nGantman and joined by then-Judge Mundy, President Judge Emeritus Ford Elliot, and\nJudges Panella, Shogan, and Olson. Then-Judge Donohue dissented, joined by\nPresident Judge Emeritus Bender and Judge Ot, opining that the majority\n“overemphasize[d] the few similarities that exist between Tyson’s prior rape conviction\nand the present mater while completely dismissing the several important differences\nbetween the two incidents.” Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 363 (Donohue, J., dissenting). The\ndissent further disputed the en banc majority’s reliance upon the need for the prior bad\nacts evidence “to bolster the credibility of the Commonwealth’s only witness where there\nis no indication that the witness is otherwise impeachable.” /d. at 364.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4853", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 42 of 8o\nfive prior bad acts witnesses established a “predictable patern” that reflected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>'s\n“unique sexual assault playbook.” <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, 224 A.3d at 4o2. Accordingly, the panel\nconcluded that the witnesses’ testimony was admissible to shou <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s common plan,\nscheme, or design.\n\nThe Superior Court further agreed with the trial court that the prior bad acts\nevidence was admissible to demonstrate the absence of mistake on <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s part as to\nConstand’s consent. The court concluded that Tyson’s rationale was applicable to the\ninstant case. The court rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s efforts to distinguish Constand’s allegations\nfrom those dating to the l98os. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> emphasized the fact that the relationship between\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and Constand lasted longer than his relationship with any of the prior bad acts\nwitnesses, that Constand was a guest at <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s home on multiple occasions, that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nand Constand had exchanged gifts, that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> had made prior sexual advances touard\nConstand, that the nature of the sexual contact differed among the alleged victims, and\nthat the alleged prior assaults occurred in hotel rooms or at the home of a third party,\nwhile the incident with Constand occurred in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s home. /d. at 4ol-o2. The Superior\nCourt dismissed these apparent dissimilarities as unimportant, opining that “ijt is\nimpossible for two incidents of sexual assault involving different victims to be identical in\nallrespects.” /d. at 4o2. The court added that it would be “simply unreasonable” to require\ntwo incidents to be absolutely identical in order to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), and\nconcluded that “[i]t is the patern itself, and not the mere presence of some inconsistencies\nbetween the various assaults, that determines admissibility under these exceptions.” /d.\n\nAs to the temporal gap between the prior bad acts and the incident involving\nConstand, the Superior Court acknouledged that, even if the evidence were otherwise\nadmissible under Rule 4o4(b), it “will be rendered inadmissible if it is too remote.” /d. at\n4o5 (quoting Commonwealth v. Shively, 424 A.2d l257, l259 (Pa. l98l)). The panel\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4854", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 43 of 8o\nagreed with the trial court’s statement that the significance of the age of a prior bad act is\n“inversely proportional” to the similarity between the prior bad act and the facts underlying\nthe charged offense. /d. (quoting Commonwealth v. Aikens, 99o A.2d ll8l, ll85 (Pa.\nSuper. 2olo)). Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the\nevents in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by the trial court to conclude\nthat “the at-issue time gap is relatively inconsequential.” /d. “Moreover,” the panel opined,\n“because [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] identity in this case was not in dispute (as he claimed he only engaged\nin consensual sexual contact with [Constand]), there was no risk of misidentification”\nthrough the admission of the prior bad acts evidence, “despite the gap in time.” /d.\n\nAdditionally, the Superior Court rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s contention that the trial court had\nfailed to weigh adequately the prejudicial impact of the prior bad acts evidence. The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were sufficient to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o. The court credited the Commonwealth’s\nargument that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s familiarity with Qualudes was suggestive of his mens rea,\ninasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances knoun to him for purposes of\ndetermining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated\nindecent assault—recklessness.” /d. (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)(2)). Moreover, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\n“knouledge of the use of central nervous system depressants, coupled with his likely past\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4855", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 44 of 8o\nuse of the same with the [prior bad acts] witnesses, were essential to resolving the\notherwise he-said-she-said nature of [Constand’s] allegations.” /d. The Superior Court\nadded that the trial court did not err in determining that the probative value of this evidence\noutweighed its potential for unfair prejudice, inasmuch as, “in a vacuum, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s use and\ndistribution of a then-legal ‘party drug’ nearly half a century ago did not appear highly\nprejudicial,” and “only becomes significantly prejudicial, and fairly so, when, in the context\nof other evidence, it establishes <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>'s knouledge of and familiarity with central nervous\nsystem depressants for purposes of demonstrating that he was at least reckless” in giving\nConstand such a drug before having sexual contact with her. /d. at 42o-2l (emphasis in\noriginal) (cleaned up). The court added that any potential for unfair prejudice was\nmitigated substantially by the court’s cautionary instructions, and that, accordingly, there\nwas no error in the admission of this evidence. /d. at 42l.\n\nTurning to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s claims relating to the enforceability of the non-prosecution or\nimmunity decision rendered by then-District Atorney Castor, the Superior Court viewed\nthis as a challenge to the denial of a motion to quash a criminal complaint, which would\nbe evaluated under an abuse-of-discretion standard. /d. at 4lo. Like the trial court, the\npanel found no “authority suggesting that a district atorney ‘may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. at 4ll (quoting\nT.C.O. at 62). Therefore, the court opined, “it is clear on the face of the record that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there was no enforceable non-\nprosecution agreement in this case.” /d. The court added: “Even assuming Mr. Castor\npromised not to prosecute [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>], only a court order can convey such immunity. Such\npromises exist only as exercises of prosecutorial discretion, and may be revoked at any\ntime.” /d. The court discussed the immunity statute and observed that it provides that “a\ndistrict atorney may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4856", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 45 of 8o\ncourt... .” /d. (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A.

The panel opined that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 46 of 8o\nNational Enquirer on the details of its published interview with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, and that Atorney\nSchmit negotiated a term of the setlement agreement with Constand that required her\nassurance that she would not cooperate with any future criminal investigation.

The\nSuperior Court agreed that “the evidence was entirely inconsistent with [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>'s] alleged\nreliance on Mr. Castor’s promise in choosing not to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege\nin the civil suit.” /d. at 4l3-l4.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Superior Court rejected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s claim that the trial court\nerred in failing to suppress his deposition testimony due to the immunity that he\npurportedly should have enjoyed.

The panel\ndistinguished all of the precedents upon which <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> relied, including this Court’s\ndecision in Commonwealth v. Stipetich, 652 A.2d l294 (Pa. l995).\n\nIn Stipetich, Pitsburgh police personnel had promised George and Heidi Stipetich\nthat, if they answered questions about the source of the drugs found in their home, no\ncharges would be filed against them. After the Stipetiches fulfilled their part of the\nagreement, prosecutors charged them anyway. /d. at l294-95. The trial court granted\nthe Stipetiches’ motion to dismiss the charges on the basis of the police promise. /d. at\nl295.

Although the Superior Court dismissed this passage from Stipetich as dicta,\nit found the situation distinguishable in any event inasmuch as former D.A.

The trial court had “determined that Mr. Castor’s\ntestimony and, by implication, Atorney Schmit’s testimony (which was premised upon\ninformation he indirectly received from Mr. Castor) were not credible.” /d. at 4l7. The\npanel added that the trial court had “found that the weight of the evidence supported its\nfinding that no agreement or grant of immunity was made, and that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] did not\nreasonably rely on any overtures by Mr. Castor to that effect when he sat for his civil\ndeposition.” /d.

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. Ruling upon <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d.

From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b). Presented with such a request, the petitioned court “shall issue\nsuch an order,” id., upon which a witness “may not refuse to testify based on his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.” /d. § 5947(c). At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> with transactional immunity. He\nexplained that this conferral was predicated upon the state’s common-law authority as a\nsovereign rather than any statutory provisions or protocols. T.C.O. at 5/7 (citing N.T.,\n2/2/2ol6, at 232, 234, 236). The record does not contradict his testimony. There is no\nevidence, nor any real contention, that the parties even contemplated a grant of immunity\nunder Section 5947. The trial court’s finding that the interaction between D.A. Castor and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4862", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5l of 8o\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was not a formal atempt to bestou transactional immunity upon <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> is\nsupported by the record.\n\nThe trial court’s description of former D.A. Castor’s testimony as inconsistent and\nequivocal finds support in the record as well. At times, the former district atorney was\nemphatic that he intended his decision not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to bind the Commonwealth\npermanently, provided no substantive changes occurred in the case, such as <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nconfessing to the alleged crimes or proof appearing that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> had lied to, or atempted\nto deceive, the investigators. In addition to the unconditional nature of the press release,\nformer D.A. Castor told then-District Atorney Ferman in his first email to her that he\n“intentionally and specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state\nprosecution.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-5. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, Mr. Castor\nasserted that, by “signing off on the press release, he was “stating that the\nCommonwealth will not bring a case against <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> for this incident based upon then-\navailable evidence.” /d., Exh. D-7.\n\nFurther indicative of his intent to forever preclude prosecution of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> for the\n2oo4 incident, former D.A. Castor testified that the signed press release was meant to\nserve as proof for a future civil judge that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would not be prosecuted, thus stripping\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> of his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Mr. Castor emphasized that his decision\nwas “absolute that [<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>] never would be prosecuted.” T.C.O. at 52. The former district\natorney stressed that his intent was to “absolutely” remove “for all time” the prospect of\na prosecution, because, in his view, only a steadfast guarantee would permanently strip\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> of his right to invoke the Fifth Amendment. N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67. Mr. Castor also\nexpounded upon the purpose of his emails to D.A. Ferman, which he claimed were an\natempt to inform her that, while he bound the Commonwealth with regard to the 2oo4\nincident, she was free to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> for any other crimes that she might uncover.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4863", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 52 of 8o\n\nAlthough former D.A. Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> if <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings. Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\ncircumstances, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging discretion binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same discretion. This is a question of law.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4864", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 62 of 8o\n\nThat is what happened in this case. There has been considerable debate over the\nlegal significance of District Atorney Castor’s publicly announced decision not to\nprosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in 2oo5. Before the trial court, the Superior Court, and nou this Court,\nthe parties have vigorously disputed whether D.A. Castor and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> reached a binding\nagreement, whether D.A. Castor extended an enforceable promise, or whether any act of\nlegal significance occurred at all. There is testimony in the record that could support any\nof these conclusions. The trial court—the entity charged with sorting through those\nfacts—found that D.A. Castor made no agreement or overt promise.\n\nMuch of that debate, and the atendant factual conclusions, were based upon the\napparent absence of a formal agreement and former D.A. Castor’s various efforts to\ndefend and explain his actions ten years after the fact. As a reviewing court, we accept\nthe trial court’s conclusion that the district atorney's decision was merely an exercise of\nhis charging discretion.24 As we assess whether that decision, and the surrounding\nmA The dissent agrees—as do we —with the trial court’s conclusion that D.A. Castor’s\ndecision not to prosecute was, at its core, an exercise of the inherent charging discretion\nvested in district atorneys. See D.O. at l. But the dissent would simply end the analysis\nthere. In the dissent’s view, once a decision is deemed to fall within a prosecutor’s\ndiscretion, that decision “in no way” can bind the actions of future elected prosecutors.\nRespectfully, this perspective overlooks the verity that not all decisions are the same. As\nto routine discretionary decisions, the dissent may be correct. But as we explain\nthroughout this opinion, what occurred here was anything but routine. Here, D.A. Castor’s\nexercise of discretion was made deliberately to induce the deprivation of a fundamental\nright. The typical decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute, is not made for the purpose\nof extracting incriminating information from a suspect when there exists no other\nmechanism to do so.\n\nThe dissent would amalgamate and confine all “present exercise[s] of prosecutorial\ndiscretion” within a single, non-binding, unenforceable, and unreviewable category. /d.\nWe decline to endorse this blanket approach, as such decisions merit, and indeed require,\nindividualized evaluation. To rule otherwise would authorize, if not encourage,\nprosecutors to choose temporarily not to prosecute, obtain incriminating evidence from\nthe suspect, and then reverse course with impunity. Due process necessarily requires\nthat court officials, particularly prosecutors, be held to a higher standard. This is\nparticularly so in circumstances where the prosecutor’s decision is crafted specifically to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4874", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 63 of 8o\ncircumstances, implicated <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s due process rights, former D.A. Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\nprosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-4. The trial court’s narrou interpretation of\ninduce a defendant to forfeit a constitutional right, and where the defendant has relied\nupon that decision to his detriment.

The entire\npassage reads as follous:\n\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\n\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\n\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint potential jurors.\n\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\n\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\n\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\n\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\n\nthe need arise. Much exists in this investigation that could be used (by\n\nothers) to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a less than flatering\n\nlight. The District Atorney encourages the parties to resolve their dispute\n\nfrom this point forward with a minimum of rhetoric.\nId. (emphasis added).\nzs There is no doubt that there are two decisions at issue: the decision not to\nprosecute and the decision not to discuss that choice in public. The dissent would\nendorse the trial court’s selective interpretation of D.A. Castor’s language in the press\nrelease, finding at a minimum that D.A. Castor’s assertion that he would reconsider the\n“decision” is ambiguous. But a plain reading of the release belies such a construction.\nLike the trial court’s interpretation of the relevant paragraph of the press release, the\ndissent’s finding of ambiguity can result only when one overlooks the context and\nsurrounding statements quite entirely. D.A. Castor stated that he did not intend to discuss\nthe details of his decision not to prosecute. In the very next sentence, D.A. Castor stated\nthat he would reconsider “this decision” if the need arose. In context, “this decision” must\nnaturally refer to the decision not to discuss the mater with the public. This is so because\nannouncing that particular decision was the very purpose of the immediately preceding\nstatement, and the subject sentence naturally modifies that prior statement. D.A. Castor\nalready had stated earlier in the press release that he had decided not to prosecute\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. Thus, when D.A. Castor referred to “this decision” in the particular paragraph\nunder examination, he was referring not to a decision addressed much earlier in the press\nrelease but rather to the decision that he had stated for the first time in the immediately\npreceding sentence. Even more compelling is the fact that the entirety of the paragraph\nrelates to D.A. Castor’s concern about the potential effect that any public statements that\nhe would make might have on jurors empaneled in a civil case. Nothing at all in that\nparagraph pertains to the decision not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. As noted, D.A. Castor already\nhad addressed the non-prosecution decision. There is no support for the notion that D.A.\nCastor was referring to his decision not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in the middle of a paragraph\ndirected exclusively to: (l) the potential impact that any public explication by D.A. Castor\nmight have upon the fairness of a civil case; and (2) D.A. Castor’s derivative decision not\nto discuss the mater publicly in order to avoid that potential impact.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4876", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 65 of 8o\n\nWhen we review the statement in its full context, it is clear that, when D.A. Castor\nannounced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.\nNothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. The trial court’s\nconclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\nreliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s reliance was his\ncounseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the\nStates via incorporation though the Fourteenth Amendment, commands that “[n]o person\n... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. CONST.\namend. V. The right to refuse to incriminate oneself is an “essential mainstay” of our\nconstitutional system of criminal justice. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. l, 7 (l964).

No court could have forced <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to testify in a deposition or at a trial so\nlong as the potential for criminal charges remained. Here, houever, when called for\ndeposition, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> no longer faced criminal charges. When compelled to testify, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nno longer had a right to invoke his right to remain silent.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was forced to sit for four depositions. That he did not—and could not—\nchoose to remain silent is apparent from the record. When <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> atempted to decline\nto answer certain questions about Constand, Constand’s atorneys obtained a ruling from\nthe civil trial judge forcing <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to answer. Most significantly, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, having maintained\nhis innocence in all maters and having been advised by a number of atorneys, provided\ncritical evidence of his recurring history of supplying women with central nervous system\ndepressants before engaging in (allegedly unwanted) sexual activity with them—the very\nassertion that undergirded Constand’s criminal complaint.\n\nThe trial court questioned whether <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> believed that he no longer had a Fifth\nAmendment right to invoke during the civil proceedings, or whether he would have\ninvoked that right had he still possessed it. The court noted that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> voluntarily had\nsubmited to a police interview and had provided the police with a consent-based defense.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> repeated this narrative in his depositions. The court found no reason to believe\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would not continue to cooperate as he had, and, thus, discerned no reason\nfor him to invoke the Fifth Amendment. In other words, it was not that the trial court\nsurmised that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> had no privilege against compulsory self-incrimination to invoke, but\nrather that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> simply chose not to invoke it.\n\nThe trial court’s conjecture was legally erroneous. The trial court surmised that,\nalthough <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> repeatedly told an exculpatory, consent-based version of the January\n2oo4 incident, he naturally would have been willing to offer inculpatory information about\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4879", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 68 of 8o\nhimself as well. Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving\nevidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U.S. 436, 473 (l966); Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 33o (Pa. l972).\nThe fact that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> did not assert any right to remain silent to the police or while siting\nfor the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by\nD.A. Castor’s decision, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> did not do so at other junctures is not proof that he held the right but elected not\nto invoke it, as the trial court evidently reasoned. To assume an implicit waiver of the\nright violates a court’s “duty . . . to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen,”\nand to construe the existence of such rights broadly. Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo64 (quoting\nBoyd, supra).\n\nThese legal commandments compel only one conclusion. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> did not invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment before he incriminated himself because he was operating under the\nreasonable belief that D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute him meant that “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exist[ed].” /d. at lo65. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> could\nnot invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the Commonwealth’s assurances\nthat he faced no risk of prosecution. Not only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision\nnot to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> strip <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> of a fundamental constitutional right, but, because he\nwas forced to testify, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> provided Constand’s civil atorneys with evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\npast use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s ability to defend against the civil action, and led to a setlement for a significant\namount of money. We are left with no doubt that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> relied to his detriment upon the\ndistrict atorney’s decision not to prosecute him. The question then becomes whether\nthat reliance was reasonable. Unreasonable reliance warrants no legal remedy.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 69 of 8o\n\nWe already have determined that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in fact relied upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\nWe nou conclude that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s reliance was reasonable, and that it also was reasonable\nfor D.A. Castor to expect <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to so rely. The record establishes without contradiction\nthat depriving <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> of his Fifth Amendment right was D.A. Castor’s intended result.2’\nHis actions were specifically designed to that end. The former district atorney may have\nequivocated or contradicted himself years later with regard to hou he endeavored to\nachieve that result, but there has never been any question as to what he intended to\nachieve. There can be no doubt that, by choosing not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> and then\n27 The dissent asserts that we have predicated our decision upon the existence of an\n“unwriten promise,” which was rejected by the trial court’s credibility findings. D.O. at 3.\nTo the contrary. As we explained earlier, we have accepted the trial court’s findings in\nthis regard, and those findings, which are supported by the record, are binding on this\nCourt. See, supra, page 48 (citing O’Rourke, 778 A.2d at ll99 (Pa. 2ool)). Houever,\nour deference is limited to the factual findings only; we may draw our oun inferences\ntherefrom and reach our oun legal conclusions. See /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d at 63l.\nThus, the trial court’s factual finding that no formal bargained-for-exchange, writen or\nunwriten, occurred does not constrain our legal analysis, nor does it in any way serve to\nimmunize D.A. Castor’s actions from constitutional scrutiny. That there was no formal\npromise does not mean that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> no longer had due process rights.\n\nThe trial court’s credibility finding regarding the existence vel non of a particular\npromise does not allou us to ignore the remainder of the overwhelming evidence of\nrecord. The record firmly establishes that D.A. Castor’s desired result was to strip <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>\nof his Fifth Amendment rights. This patent and developed fact stands separate and apart\nfrom the trial court’s finding that D.A. Castor never extended a formal promise.\n\nThe dissent would ignore the undeniable reality that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> relied to his detriment\nupon D.A. Castor’s decision. The dissent does so by shifting the perspective from D.A.\nCastor’s actions to <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s, focusing in particular upon the fact that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> did not record\nthe purported agreement or reduce it to writing. As we note in this opinion, in this context,\nneither a promise, nor an agreement, nor a contract, nor evidence of reliance derives\nlegal validity only upon being recorded or upon writen materialization. The law knous no\nsuch prerequisite, and <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> cannot be punished for failing to comply with a legal\nrequirement that does not exist. The proof of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s reliance is plain on the face of the\nrecord. It is the fact that, upon the advice and assistance of counsel, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> sat for four\ndepositions and incriminated himself, obviously a decision made after and in direct\nreliance upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s reliance upon the conclusions and\nadvice of his atorneys reasonable, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to\ncounsel.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4882", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7l of 8o\n\nTo hold otherwise would recast our understanding of reasonableness into\nsomething unrecognizable and unsustainable under our law. If <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the Commonwealth,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client relationship would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is necessary in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice Black.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement of the Commonwealth’s charging decision.\n\nThe trial court alternatively suggested that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s belief that he would never be\nprosecuted, thus stripping him of his Fifth Amendment rights, based upon litle more than\na press release, was unreasonable because neither <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> nor his atorneys demanded\nthat the terms of any offers or assurances by D.A. Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance. We decline to construe as unreasonable\nthe failure to do that which the law does not require.\n\nIt also has been suggested that the level of the defendant’s sophistication is a\nrelevant factor in assessing whether his reliance upon a prosecutor’s decision was\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4883", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 72 of 8o\nreasonable. Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> reasonably relied upon the\nCommonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances. Knouing\nthat he induced <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s reliance, and that his decision not to prosecute was designed to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4884", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 73 of 8o\ndo just that, D.A. Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> violated <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv. Mebane, 58 A.3d l243 (Pa. Super. 2ol2) (upholding trial court ruling that fundamental\n28 See Khan v.

McSorley,\n485 A.2d l5, 2o (Pa. Super. l984), aff'd, 5o6 A.2d 895 (Pa. l986) (per curiam) (enforcing\nan incomplete agreement based upon detrimental reliance). As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement. In that case, Stipetich agreed with the police that, if he revealed\nhis source for obtaining drugs, no charges would be filed against him or his wife.\nStipetich, 652 A.2d at l294-95. Even though Stipetich fulfilled his end of the bargain,\ncharges still were filed against him and his wife. /d. at l295.

In light of the extent and duration of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 77 of 8o\nOur disagreement with the CDO arises concerning its view that mere suppression of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s deposition testimony will remedy his constitutional harm and “fully” restore him\nto where he stood before he detrimentally relied upon D.A. Castor’s inducement.*' This\nperspective understates the gravity of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s harm in this case, and suppression alone\nis insufficient to provide a full remedy of the consequences of the due process violation.\n\nThe CDO would limit our assessment of the harm suffered by <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to the\nCommonwealth's use of the deposition testimony at his two trials. But the harm is far\ngreater than that, and it began long before even the first trial. It must be remembered\nthat D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, and to announce that decision orally\nand in a writen press release, was not designed to facilitate the use of testimony against\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> in a future criminal trial. Instead, D.A. Castor induced <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s forfeiture of his Fifth\nAmendment rights as a mechanism and a lever to aid Constand’s civil action and to\nimprove the chances that she would receive at least a monetary benefit for the abuse that\nshe suffered, given that D.A. Castor had determined that Constand would not, and could\nnot, get relief in a criminal trial. Through his deliberate efforts, D.A. Castor effectively\nforced <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to participate against himself in a civil case in a way that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would not\nhave been required to do had he retained his constitutional privilege against self-\nincrimination. To say the least, this development significantly weakened <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s legal\nposition. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multi-\nmillion dollar setlement. The end result was exactly what D.A.

Nor can we ignore the fact that weakening <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s position in that\ncivil case was precisely why D.A. Castor proceeded as he did. Suppression of evidence\nin a third criminal trial can never restore <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to the position he held before he forfeited\nhis Fifth Amendment rights. The consequences of D.A. Castor’s actions include the civil\nmater, and no exclusion of deposition testimony can restore <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s injuries in that\nregard.\n\nIt was not only the deposition testimony that harmed <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>. As a practical mater,\nthe moment that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> was charged criminally, he was harmed: all that he had forfeited\nearlier, and the consequences of that forfeiture in the civil case, were for naught. This\nwas, as the CDO itself characterizes it, an unconstitutional “coercive bait-and-switch.”°2\nIt is the true and full breadth of the consequences of the due process violation that\nseparates this case from the cases relied upon by the CDO, including Stipetich.2° Each\nof those prosecutions involved defective or unenforceable promises that resulted in\nsuppression remedies. Critically, none of them featured the additional harm inflicted in\nthis case. In none of those cases did the effects of the constitutional violation extend to\nmaters beyond the criminal trial, as was the circumstance here. Accordingly, none of\nthose cases support, much less compel, the limited remedy that the CDO proffers.\n\nThe impact of the due process violation here is vast. The remedy must match that\nimpact.

All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all.

We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295. We will not\nundermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely recognized pouer to conduct criminal\nlitigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to decide whether and\nwhen to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d.

DiPasquale, 246 A.2d 43o, 432 (Pa. l968)). The decision to charge,\nor not to charge, a defendant can be conditioned, modified, or revoked at the discretion\nof the prosecutor.\n\nHouever, the discretion vested in our Commonwealth’s prosecutors, houever\nvast, does not mean that its exercise is free of the constraints of due process. When an\nunconditional charging decision is made publicly and with the intent to induce action and\nreliance by the defendant, and when the defendant does so to his detriment (and in some\ninstances upon the advice of counsel), denying the defendant the benefit of that decision\nis an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution\nthat was foregone for more than a decade. No mere changing of the guard strips that\ncircumstance of its inequity. See, e.g., State v. Myers, 5l3 S.E.2d 676, 682 n.l (W.Va.\nl998) (explaining that “any change in the duly elected prosecutor does not affect the\nstandard of responsibility for the office”). A contrary result would be patently untenable.\nIt would violate long-cherished principles of fundamental fairness. It would be antithetical\nto, and corrosive of, the integrity and functionality of the criminal justice system that we\nstrive to maintain.\n\nFor these reasons, <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s convictions and judgment of sentence are vacated,\nand he is discharged.*°\n\nJustices Todd, Donohue and Mundy join the opinion.\n\nJustice Dougherty files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which\nChief Justice Baer joins.\n\nJustice Saylor files a dissenting opinion.\na5 Accordingly, we do not address <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s other issue.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4892", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l Page3of7\nPage 3\n\nlawyers was making outrageously false statements to the press.2 The prosecution\nresponded: “Spencer Kuvin does not represent any of the witnesses the Government\nexpects to call at trial in this case.

Even if the local rules somehou applied to undersigned counsel, the\n\nOp-Ed did not violate the local rule.\n\nEven if the local rule applies to a lawyer who does not currently represent a party\nor a witness and has never appeared in the trial court, the opinion piece here did not\nviolate the rule.\n\nFirst, there is no risk of danger or prejudice to the upcoming trial because the\nOp-Ed raised the same argument — that the <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> decision applied to Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase — that was filed in public pleadings that were quoted by the press. No confidential\ninformation was disclosed.2 Ms. Maxwell’s trial lawyers made the very same argument\nin a public pleading that was quoted by the press. (Dkt. No. 3lo). In that public\npleading, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers argue:\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was\n\nenforceable and that DA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> ten years later\n\non the same charges violated his Due Process rights. (Id. at 78-79). As a\n\nresult, the Court vacated Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>’s conviction. (Id. at 79). In so holding,\n\nthe Court noted the follouing:\n\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant,\nincluding circumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some\npromise or assurance made by the former, are not immune from the\ndictates of due process and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, the\n\ngovernment is trying to renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms.\n\nMaxwell over 25 years later for the exact same offenses for which she\n\nwas granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even\n\nmore strongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal\n2 Emma Parry, Will She Survive?, (May 6, 2o2l),\n\nhtps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/l4875477/ghislaine-maxwell-plea-deal-same-fate-as-\nepstein/\n3 See Gentile, 5ol U.S. at lo74 (explaining that the risk of influencing a potential jury\nexists for trial lawyer because they “have special access to information through\ndiscovery and client communications” that others do not have).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4957", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l  Page4of7\nPage 4\n\nwriten agreement, as opposed to an informal promise like the one in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>.\n\nThis is not consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.\n(emphasis added).\n\nThe press (including Bloomberg, NBC, the New York Post, and Forbes)‘ reported\non this argument by Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers. Accordingly, there is no substantial\nlikelihood that the Op-Ed, which made the very same arguments that were made by\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers and covered extensively in the press, will interfere with a fair\ntrial, and the Government does not even really atempt to argue to the contrary.®\n\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell’s family, and undersigned as counsel for her family, have\nthe right to respond to the numerous lawyers, witnesses, and surrogates who are\nspeaking to the press and making it impossible for Ms. Maxwell to receive a fair trial.\nAs Justice Kennedy explained in Gentile, “in some circumstances press comment is\nnecessary to protect the rights of the client and prevent abuse.” Such “statements have\nthe full protection of the First Amendment.” Gentile, 5ol U.S. at lo58 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring).\n\nThe press has been unrelenting and overwhelmingly prejudicial in its coverage\nof Ms. Maxwell and her family, fueled by statements from involved parties about the\nmaters at issue. It is not an understatement to say that 99.9% of the press coverage\nis pro-government and anti-Maxwell. The press has already tried and convicted her.\nAnd the Government has done nothing to control its surrogates, which has only made\nthe problem worse. Hou can Ms. Maxwell be expected to receive a fair trial when\nlawyers for the accusers are holding press conferences, leaking information, and\n4 See, e.g., htps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2o2l-o7-o2/ghislaine-maxwell-\nsays-<span class=\"highlight\">cosby</span>-ruling-should-end-her-abuse-case; htps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-\nnews/ghislaine-maxwell-s-lawyers-cite-<span class=\"highlight\">cosby</span>-case-bid-have-sex-nl273o37;\nhtps://nypost.com/2o2l/o7/o2/ghislaine-maxwell-should-be-sprung-from-prison-just-\nlike-bill-<span class=\"highlight\">cosby</span>-lawyers/; and\nhtps://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2o2l/o7/o2/ghislaine-maxwell-tells-judge-her-\ncase-should-be-tossed-out-like-cosbys/?sh=68a89d9578bc\n5 The Government also complains that the Op-Ed described the accusations as “stale”\nand “flimsy.” But both descriptions have been used in publicly filed pleadings.\nMoreover, many of the accusations are in fact decades old, and similar descriptive\nwords have been held not to violate the rules. See, e.g., Law36o, Brooklyn U.S.\nAtorney’s Pretrial Remarks Fair Game, Judge Says, July l, 2o2l (reporting that Judge\nDora Irizarry held that U.S. Atorney’s comments that defendant had engaged in a\n“spree” of robberies that were “unprecedented” did not violate the local rule and also\ndid not prejudice the defendant), story available at: htps://tinyurl.com/4bnu2kfz\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4958", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004960.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l Page6eof7\nPage 6\nstrong measures to ensure that the balance is never weighed against the accused.”).\nThe Government’s contention that the prosecution won't receive a fair trial based on\nmy statements is completely divorced from the reality of what is occurring in the media\nin this case.7\nThird, the Government has helped to create a totally unlevel playing field and it\nshould not be heard to complain. For starters, the Government conducted an over-the-\ntop press conference upon Ms. Maxwell’s arrest — with blouups, photographs,\nsoundbites, inflammatory language, and strategic pauses to get the most impactful\nphoto opportunity, all designed to stir up the press, inflame the passions of the public,\nand prejudice the potential jury against Ms. Maxwell. And it worked. The Government’s\npress conference was one of, if not the most, covered Government’s press conferences in\nU.S. history.

June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> mandates a different result.

In any event,\nthe state court in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34.

Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI. This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “This protection\napplies both to successive punishments and to successive prosecutions for the same criminal\noffense.” United States v. Dixon, 5o9 U.S. 688, 696 (l993). “A defendant may only raise a\nDouble Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime\nbefore the alleged ‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (l978); Morris v. Reynolds,\n264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the\nGovernment is free to commence a prosecution.\n\nMaxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.\nShe concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense. She was never\ncharged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She\nagreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it.

June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span> after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. <span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district. Instead, the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020814.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel96 of 2o8\ncase focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be\nclear in the absence of a formal plea agreement. Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cosby</span>, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI. This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “This protection\napplies both to successive punishments and to successive prosecutions for the same criminal\noffense.” United States v. Dixon, 5o9 U.S. 688, 696 (l993). “A defendant may only raise a\nDouble Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime\nbefore the alleged ‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (l978); Morris v. Reynolds,\n264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the\nGovernment is free to commence a prosecution.\n\nMaxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.\nShe concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense. She was never\ncharged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She\nagreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it. She suffered no criminal\nconsequences as a result of Epstein’s guilty plea in Florida state court.
