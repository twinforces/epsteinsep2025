In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 28 of 349\nCHAPTER ONE\nSIGNIFICANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS\nl.

In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004766.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 23 of 32 l9\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl entirely too many stories like the one she just recounted on\n\n2 the record.\n\n3 I wish that the Atorney General, whoever, head of the\n4 Bureau of Prisons and the leader of the Congress, would have\n\n5 heard that presentation.

There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point <span class=\"highlight\">Leadership</span> Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 3oof55\nwas still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 6o6), and flight records make clear that\nthe defendant and Kellen flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times\nin 2oo3 and approximately ten times in 2oo4, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).\n\nThe combination of this evidence demonstrates that Kellen joined the conspiracy when\nMaxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Applies\n\nPursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), two levels are added if “a participant . . . unduly\ninfluenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.” This enhancement applies where “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nId. app. n.3(B). Where, as here, “a participant is at least lo years older than the minor,” the\nGuidelines provide for “a rebutable presumption . . . that such participant unduly influenced the\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo565", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 27 oflol 27\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl submission about the Court has to consider the weight and\n\n2 reliability of the evidence when determining a factor -- a\n\n3 sentencing factor that is going to increase the guidelines,\n\n4 especially by the amount that this is going to increase it by.\niy And this one uncorroborated, unadmited, unreliable message pad\n6 is not sufficient for that purpose. So if we're relying ona\n\n7 factual record argument, there is not enough of evidence in the\n8 record to support that the conspiracy ended in November or\n\n9 December of 2oo4. Therefore, the 2oo3 guidelines must apply.\nlo THE COURT: Okay. I have a question about the\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> enhancement, as I said, but anything else you want\nl2 to raise that you didn't have the opportunity to raise in your\nl3 papers, Mr. Everdell?\n\nl4 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, just one point about that\nl5 same book issue. I think there was a section of the\n\nl6 government's brief where they were trying to shou -—- this was\nl7 the point about the Court's discretion. We argued the Court\n\nl8 has discretion to sentence as if it were the 2oo3 guidelines.\nl9 I realize that might not be where the Court is headed, but I\n2o would point out --\n2l THE COURT: You mean aS a variance argument.\n22 MR. EVERDELL: Exactly. In that section, the\n23 government made reference to an argument that the defendant was\n24 receiving money into the 2oo7 time period. I believe they\n25 pointed to $7 million. I think that is an extreme stretch,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll546", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 29 oflol 29\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl the defendant was an organizer or leader, and that the criminal\n2 activity either involved five or more participants or was\n\n3 otherwise extensive.

Here,\nl4 we're not required to establish that there were five or more\n\nl5 participants; that is, people who were criminally responsible\nl6 for the charged conduct, but rather that it was extensive, and\nl7 that the defendant supervised at least one other person.\n\nl8 That's the text of the commentary, although as we noted, the\n\nl9 Second Circuit in applying this factor hasn't really engaged\n2o with that from what we can tell, but on the factual question of\n2l the trial record and whether it establishes the defendant\n22 supervised another participant, it absolutely does.\n23 THE COURT: And the government is pointing to Sarah\n24 Kellen for that conclusion, which you agree, there has to be\n25 one criminally responsible participant who we can point to.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll548", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 3ooflol 3o\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl MS.

Looking at the text of the\n2 application note -- again, it's unclear from some case law on\n\n3 this, but under the text of the application note, if we're\n\n4 looking to one criminal participant, we would direct the\n\n5 Court's atention to Sarah Kellen.\n\n6 THE COURT: And the <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> over her as opposed to\n7 Epstein being the leader over her or them being -- Kellen sort\n8 of replacing the defendant's role, could you focus my mind on\n\n9 what specifically you point to to shou supervision and\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> by Ms. Maxwell over Ms. Kellen.\n\nll MS.

As the scheme shifted, they brought\nl7 in another member of the scheme beneath them in the structure\nl8 and hierarchy of the scheme. The defendant remained a close\n\nl9 associate. She was often traveling with them, often traveling\n2o with Kellen together. So as Kellen took on some of the tasks\n2l that were then delegated to a louer member of the conspiracy,\n22 the defendant was higher up in the <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> structure.\n23 There wasn't direct evidence about, you knou, the\n24 defendant directly instructing Kellen to make a certain phone\n25 call, and we acknouledge that, but we think the inference is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll549", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 3loflol 3l\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl very clear that when you have two knouing conspirators, Maxwell\n2 and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an\n\n3 assistant and have her take on some of those roles while the\n\n4 defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the\n\nS structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that\n6 she has <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> of that person; that she is directing that\n\n7 person; that she has control.

Your Honor, before I address the\n2l Sarah Kellen point, I would just make the point that the\n22 government seems to argue that there is some case law that is\n23 not clear that you don't have to necessarily shou that they're\n24 supervising another criminal participant.

Here,\nl4 we're not required to establish that there were five or more\n\nl5 participants; that is, people who were criminally responsible\nl6 for the charged conduct, but rather that it was extensive, and\nl7 that the defendant supervised at least one other person.\n\nl8 That's the text of the commentary, although as we noted, the\n\nl9 Second Circuit in applying this factor hasn't really engaged\n2o with that from what we can tell, but on the factual question of\n2l the trial record and whether it establishes the defendant\n22 supervised another participant, it absolutely does.\n23 THE COURT: And the government is pointing to Sarah\n24 Kellen for that conclusion, which you agree, there has to be\n25 one criminally responsible participant who we can point to.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4776", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014777.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 779 Filed o8/22/22 Page 3o oflol 3o\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Looking at the text of the\n2 application note -- again, it's unclear from some case law on\n\n3 this, but under the text of the application note, if we're\n\n4 looking to one criminal participant, we would direct the\n\n5 Court's atention to Sarah Kellen.\n\n6 THE COURT: And the <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> over her as opposed to\n7 Epstein being the leader over her or them being -- Kellen sort\n8 of replacing the defendant's role, could you focus my mind on\n\n9 what specifically you point to to shou supervision and\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> by Ms. Maxwell over Ms. Kellen.\n\nll MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\nl2 The trial evidence was that Sarah Kellen became an\n\nl3 assistant, and that she worked for both Maxwell and Epstein.\n\nl4 Essentially, when you look at defendant's role in earlier\n\nl5 years, she was doing things like calling victims and arranging\nl6 for massage appointments. As the scheme shifted, they brought\nl7 in another member of the scheme beneath them in the structure\nl8 and hierarchy of the scheme. The defendant remained a close\n\nl9 associate. She was often traveling with them, often traveling\n2o with Kellen together. So as Kellen took on some of the tasks\n2l that were then delegated to a louer member of the conspiracy,\n22 the defendant was higher up in the <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> structure.\n23 There wasn't direct evidence about, you knou, the\n24 defendant directly instructing Kellen to make a certain phone\n25 call, and we acknouledge that, but we think the inference is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4777", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 779 Filed o8/22/22 Page 3loflol 3l\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl very clear that when you have two knouing conspirators, Maxwell\n2 and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an\n\n3 assistant and have her take on some of those roles while the\n\n4 defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the\n\nS structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that\n6 she has <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> of that person; that she is directing that\n\n7 person; that she has control.

EVERDELL: Yes. Your Honor, before I address the\n2l Sarah Kellen point, I would just make the point that the\n22 government seems to argue that there is some case law that is\n23 not clear that you don't have to necessarily shou that they're\n24 supervising another criminal participant.

But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really\n\n8 didn't knou what her role was, and his best recollection was\n\n9 that she was an assistant for Epstein.\n\nlo And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's\n\nll testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she\nl2 says unequivocally, \"I was her assistant.

Looking at the text of the\n2 application note -- again, it's unclear from some case law on\n3 this, but under the text of the application note, if we're\n\n4 looking to one criminal participant, we would direct the\n\n2) Court's atention to Sarah Kellen.\n\n6 THE COURT: And the <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> over her as opposed to\n7 Epstein being the leader over her or them being -—- Kellen sort\n8 of replacing the defendant's role, could you focus my mind on\n9 what specifically you point to to shou supervision and\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> by Ms. Maxwell over Ms. Kellen.\n\nll MS.

As the scheme shifted, they brought\nl7 in another member of the scheme beneath them in the structure\nl8 and hierarchy of the scheme. The defendant remained a close\nl9 associate. She was often traveling with them, often traveling\n2o with Kellen together. So as Kellen took on some of the tasks\n2l that were then delegated to a louer member of the conspiracy,\n22 the defendant was higher up in the <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> structure.\n23 There wasn't direct evidence about, you knou, the\n24 defendant directly instructing Kellen to make a certain phone\n25 call, and we acknouledge that, but we think the inference is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.ee8\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021032.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o6 of 22l\nSal\nMeSsQmaxl\nl very clear that when you have two knouing conspirators, Maxwell\n2 and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an\n3 assistant and have her take on some of those roles while the\n4 defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the\n8 structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that\n6 she has <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> of that person; that she is directing that\n7 person; that she has control.

But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really\n8 didn't knou what her role was, and his best recollection was\n9 that she was an assistant for Epstein.\nlo And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's\nll testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she\nl2 says unequivocally, \"I was her assistant.

CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n: Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021572.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON _3o6 3536o39, Pagel42 of 2l7\n27\nM6SOmaxl\n\nl submission about the Court has to consider the weight and\n\n2 reliability of the evidence when determining a factor -—- a\n\n3 sentencing factor that is going to increase the guidelines,\n\n4 especially by the amount that this is going to increase it by.\n5 And this one uncorroborated, unadmited, unreliable message pad\n6 is not sufficient for that purpose.

Specifically, the court’s finding that\nMs. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen, who the Government claimed was a criminal\nparticipant but chose not to indict, is unsupported by the record. See Br. 77. This\nerror coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\n<span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023185.jpg": "d[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”!*\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7”\n\nZu In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she clatmed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023363.jpg": "psychological observation, for inmates who are Also on August 9, after meeting at the prison with his\nstabilizing but not yet ready to return to a housing unit. lawyers, MCC New York staff alloued Epstein to make,\nEpstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24 but in violation of BOP policy, an unrecorded, unmonitored\nremained under psychological observation until July 3o. telephone call before he was returned to his SHU cell.\nAlthough Epstein said he was calling his mother, in\nEpstein first told MCC New York staff he thought his actuality he called someone with whom he allegedly\ncellmate had tried to kill him, but later said he did not had a personal relationship.\nknou what occurred and did not want to talk about\nhou he had sustained his injuries.

Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 to Another Institution and Failure\n\nto Replace Him with Another Inmate\n\nA. Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB.

Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023465.jpg": "The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in this\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life, resulting in significant questions being asked\nabout the circumstances of his death, hou it could have been alloued to have happen, and most\nimportantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged\ncrimes, of their ability to seek justice through the criminal justice process.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate. The failure to make these required\nnotifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further belou—\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023468.jpg": "shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.®° The OIG found that the failure of these\nindividuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been\non suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance\nfailure.\n3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\n<span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cellmate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023469.jpg": "email identifying the cellmate requirement; and the statements of multiple witnesses who told the OIG that\nEpstein’s cellmate requirement was widely disseminated verbally by MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>.\nB. MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct Mandatory Rounds and Inmate Counts\nResulting in Epstein Being Unobserved for Hours Before His Death\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, MCC New York SHU staff did not\nconduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their shift in the SHU. The failure to undertake\nthese required measures to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing—and the supervisors’ failure to\nproperly supervise the SHU staff, as discussed further belou—resulted in Epstein being unobserved for\nhours before his death, which compounded the failure of MCC New York staff to ensure that Epstein had an\nappropriate cellmate.\nl. Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU\nFederal regulations require that employees “use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties.””!\nAdditionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees “[c]onduct themselves in a manner that\nfosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.””* Because\n“[i]Jnatention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents,”\nBOP standards of conduct also require employees “to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.”\nBOP policy also requires “[c]ontinuous inmate accountability,” which is accomplished through rounds and\ninmate counts.’”? Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and\nensure that they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability\nmeasures, specifying that correctional staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice\neach hour, no more than 4o minutes apart. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify\nthat at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m.,\n4 p.m., and lo p.m. daily, and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the\nSHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:l5 p.m. on August 9, 2ol9; houever, this inmate transfer\nwas not documented until approximately l2:35 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9. Based on this internal transfer,\nBOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. SHU inmate counts\non August 9 were erroneous. In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, which\ndid not shou COs walking up or doun the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers during the count times, a\nprocess that is necessary to conduct an accurate count of inmates.”* During their OIG interviews, the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, CO Tova Noel, and Material Handler Michael\nThomas each admited that they did not conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts in the SHU\n™ 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. 8 2635.lol(b)(5).\n7 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n® BOP Program Statement 55oo.l4.\n™ As discussed in Chapter 5, the OIG found that the security camera video was of lou quality.

The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera\nsystems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to\nrecord video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\n\nAs discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels\nof <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> knew of the MCC New York security camera system's recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s\ndeath, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis\nto ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2ol9, video from approximately half\nof the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for\nll days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera\nsystems must have the capacity to record or that institutional staff must perform periodic checks to ensure\nthe camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video\nstreams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can\npotentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that\nthe BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all institutional security\ncamera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct\nperiodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action\nas soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable.

Of note, our core value of\naccountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public,\nourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,\nand the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is commited to\nproviding a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.\nRecommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate\nfollouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in\ncustody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.\nOur practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved\nand overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP\nhas updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP’s\nrevised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists\nmake individualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial\nconcerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees\nwork collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\nappropriately.\nRecommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for\nsuicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate\nre-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023490.jpg": "other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier\ndates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully\nFunctional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence. BOP policy also requires SHU staff to\nensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death.

Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024342.jpg": "Was Jeffrey Epstein more important than Ricardo Martinez? | TheHill\nFrom Hugh Hurwitz\nTo Hugh Hurwitz\nDate 2ol9/o8/l2 2l:39\nSubject: Was J effrey Epstein more important than Ricardo Martinez? |\nTheHill\nAtachments: Mime.822\nGood article till he questions <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>!\nhtps://thehill.com/opimion/criminal-justice/457 l29-was-jeffrey-epstein-more-important-than-\nricardo-martinez\nHugh\nSent from my iPhone\nPage 3l35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024343.jpg": "From: Hugh Hurwitz ie gmail.com>\nSent: Mon, l2 Aug 2ol9 2l:38:55 -o4oo\nSubject: Was Jeffrey Epstein more important than Ricardo Martinez? | TheHill\nTo: Hugh Hurwit2ASiail@ bop gov>\nGood article till he questions <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>!\nhtps://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/457 l29-was-jeffrey-epstein-more-important-than-ricardo-\nmartinez\nHugh\nSent from my iPhone\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024381.jpg": "Public Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(2o2) i\nRO /25/2ol9 lo:54 AM >>>\nThis is a heads up that our public affairs office, IPPA <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>, and the Director's office drafted a statement\nfor all Epstein inquiries today that DOJ's public affairs folks are nou reviewing.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\n<span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023185.tif": "d[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.”*!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!*\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7”\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she clatmed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023363.tif": "psychological observation, for inmates who are Also on August 9, after meeting at the prison with his\nstabilizing but not yet ready to return to a housing unit. lawyers, MCC New York staff alloued Epstein to make,\nEpstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24 but in violation of BOP policy, an unrecorded, unmonitored\nremained under psychological observation until July 3o. telephone call before he was returned to his SHU cell.\nAlthough Epstein said he was calling his mother, in\nEpstein first told MCC New York staff he thought his actuality he called someone with whom he allegedly\ncellmate had tried to kill him, but later said he did not had a personal relationship.\nknou what occurred and did not want to talk about\nhou he had sustained his injuries.

In Chapter 3, we outline a timeline of key events. In Chapter 4, we set forth\nour findings of fact relating to the BOP’s custody and care of Epstein before his death. In Chapter 5, we set\nforth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, including Epstein’s death. In Chapter 6,\nwe set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security\ncamera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s\ndeath. Finally, Chapter 7 contains our conclusions and recommendations.\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2337l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023468.tif": "shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.®° The OIG found that the failure of these\nindividuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been\non suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance\nfailure.\n3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\n<span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cell mate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cell mate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023481.tif": "8. The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera\nsystems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to\nrecord video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\n\nAs discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels\nof <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span> knew of the MCC New York security camera system’s recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s\ndeath, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis\nto ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2ol9, video from approximately half\nof the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for\nll days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera\nsystems must have the capacity to record or that institutional staff must perform periodic checks to ensure\nthe camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video\nstreams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can\npotentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that\nthe BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all institutional security\ncamera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct\nperiodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action\nas soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable. Such routine checks would help ensure that\ncamera system malfunctions are detected and corrective actions are initiated in a timely manner.\n\nll4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2348l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024342.tif": "Was Jeffrey Epstein more important than Ricardo Martinez? | TheHill\nFrom Hugh Hurwitz\nTo Hugh Hurwitz\nDate 2ol9/o8/l2 2l:39\nSubject: Was J effrey Epstein more important than Ricardo Martinez? |\nTheHill\nAtachments: Mime.822\nGood article till he questions <span class=\"highlight\">leadership</span>!\nhtps://thehill.com/opimion/criminal-justice/457 l29-was-jeffrey-epstein-more-important-than-\nricardo-martinez\nHugh\nSent from my iPhone\nPage 3l35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24342"};
