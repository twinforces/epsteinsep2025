Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it is\nhighly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors.\n\n78. First, under the applicable Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, a State party\nmay refuse extradition on the basis of nationality, houever if it does so, it is obliged to\nprosecute the requested person itself, on the basis of the conduct and the allegations\ncontained in the request. In the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, it is highly unlikely that the\nFrench government would be inclined to conducting such prosecution, considering that all\nthe relevant facts were commited in the USA, a long time ago, and that witnesses are also\nlocated in the USA.\n\n79. Secondly, France is mindful to preserve its good extradition relations with the United\nStates, as evidenced by a number of recent cases we reviewed or conducted in which\nFrench competent authorities proved highly <span class=\"highlight\">cooperative</span> with US authorities. If Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell were to flee to France, and the USA decided to issue an extradition\nrequest, it would be difficult for French authorities — from a diplomatic point of view — to\ndeny such an extradition request, considering that no legal bar applies.?”\n\n8o. Thirdly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell also holds American nationality, and has\nsubstantial ties to the USA, would, in all likelihood, be taken into account by the French\ngovernment as one more element weighing in favor of extradition.\n\n8l. Similarly, and fourthly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell signed a legally binding\nWaiver under US law, and would have subsequently fled to France in violation of her bail\nconditions, could equally be taken into account by the French government as an incentive\nnot to grant Ms Ghislaine Maxwell the benefit of her French nationality as a ban to\nextradition.\n\nWilliam Julie\n37 Of the 36 reported Supreme Court decisions involving extradition requests from the United States in the last 2o\nyears, the French authorities granted extradition in 34 of these cases.

Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home.

She did not take the language, “District Atorney\nCastor cautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision\nshould the need arise,” to be a threat not to speak publicly.

At no point during the\ndepositions was there any mention of an agreement or promise not to\nprosecute. In her experience, such a promise would have been put on the\nrecord at the civil depositions. She testified that during the four days of\ndepositions, [Cosby] was not <span class=\"highlight\">cooperative</span> and the depositions were\nextremely contentious. Ms. Troiani had to file motions to compel [Cosby’s]\nanswers. [Cosby’s] refusal to answer questions related to Ms. Constand’s\nallegations formed the basis of a motion to compel. When Ms. Troiani\natempted to question [Cosby] about the allegations, [Cosby’s] atorneys\nsought to have his statement to police read into the record in lieu of cross\nexamination.\nMs. Troiani testified that one of the initial provisions [Cosby] wanted in the\ncivil setlement was a release from criminal liability. [Cosby’s civil atorney\nPatrick] O’Conner’s leter to Ms. Ferman does not dispute this fact. [Cosby]\nand his atorneys also requested that Ms. Troiani agree to destroy her file,\nshe refused. Eventually, the parties agreed on the language that Ms.\nConstand would not initiate any criminal complaint. The first Ms. Troiani\nheard of a promise not to prosecute was in 2ol5. The first Ms. Kivitz learned\nof the purported promise was in a 2ol4 newspaper article.\nJohn P. Schmit, Esq., testified that he has represented [Cosby] since l983.\nIn the early l99os, he became [Cosby’s] general counsel. In 2oo5, when\nhe became aware of the instant allegations, he retained criminal counsel,\nWilliam Phillips, Esq., on [Cosby’s] behalf. Mr. Phillips dealt directly with\nthe prosecutor’s office and would then discuss all maters with Mr. Schmit.\n[Cosby’s] January 2oo5 interview took place at Mr. Schmit’s office. Both\nMr. Schmit and Mr. Phillips were present for the interview. Numerous\nquestions were asked the answers to which could lead to criminal charges.\nAt no time during his statement to police did [Cosby] invoke the Fifth\nAmendment or refuse to answer questions. Mr. Schmit testified that he had\ninterviewed [Cosby] prior to his statement and was not concerned about his\nanswers. Within weeks of the interview, the District Atorney declined to\nbring a prosecution. Mr. Schmit testified that Mr. Phillips told him that the\ndecision was an irrevocable commitment that District Atorney Castor was\nnot going to prosecute [Cosby].

The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that Epstein and his\natorney mocked her for thinking Epstein was suicidal.*®\nOn July l6, 2ol9, at Epstein’s request, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein during his atorney\nconference. The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied\nsuicidality. The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding\nadditional coping strategies. Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The\nChief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follou-up and that Epstein\nwould be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews.\nAccording to the BOP After Action Review submited by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief\nPsychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July l6, 2ol9, at Epstein’s request during his atorney conference was\ninappropriate. The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein atempted to “bring his\natorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the\nAfter Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide\npsychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet\nwith an inmate’s atorney. When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that\nthe intention was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security.\nOn July l8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was\nunavailable due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would atempt to interview Epstein in the near\nfuture to complete his monthly review.\nAs noted previously, at approximately l:27 a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his\ncell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck. The Chief Psychologist made a general\nadministrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately\n2 a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely\nhanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant l assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in\nBOP records that Epstein was <span class=\"highlight\">cooperative</span>, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein\ndid not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not knou\nwhat had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant l noted that Epstein\nhad a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-\nthirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems. Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024094.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nClinical Encounter\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/3o/2ol9 l5:58 Provider: po a Unit: Zol\nChronic Care - Chronic Care Clinic encounter performed at Health Services.\nSUBJECTIVE:\nCOMPLAINT l Provider: POO “o\nChief Complaint: Other Problem\nSubjective: PATIENT WAS REFERRED BY THE WARDEN FOR EVALUATION.\nPATIENT REPORTS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT HIS MEDS FOR ABOUT l WEEK.

He has various risk factors for suicidality at this time\nincluding a high profile case with extensive media atention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court\nproceeding yesterday which may have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein also informed this\nwriter that his only family at this time is his brother, with whom he does not have a close relationship with.\nDespite these risk factors, inmate Epstein possesses a number of protective factors at this time. Inmate Epstein adamantly\ndenied any suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He was very future oriented and requested a phone call, to meet with his\natorney, to take a shouer, and to brush his teeth.
