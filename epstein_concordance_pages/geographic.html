Epstein died while\nincarcerated on August lo, 2ol9.\n\nOne year later, after Epstein died in jail, Ghislaine\nMaxwell was indicted in the Southern District of\nNew York for her alleged actions as a co-conspirator\nof Epstein, on charges that were the same as had\nbeen brought against Epstein. Initially, Maxwell was\ncharged with crimes in the l994 to l997 timeframe,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000120.jpg": "57a\nevery instance to make clear that it applies only in the\ndistrict where signed.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite\nconclusion. The provision of the NPA dealing with\nco-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds\nU.S. Atorneys in other districts. It does not expressly\nstate that it applies in other districts. The relevant\nlanguage, in its entirety, reads as follous: “the United\nStates also agrees that it will not institute any crimi-\nnal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” Dkt.

The government’s promises, made in return\nfor demanding the defendant’s waiver of constitutional\nrights, should be rigorously enforced. Yet the louer court\npermited the government to escape its promises and\nincorrectly limited the scope of the non-prosecution and\nplea agreement (NPA) well beyond its plain language.\n\nThe intentionally broad scope of this NPA may be\nsurprising in retrospect but that does not change the\nwords on the page. Indeed, a survey of plea agreements\nfrom across the country shous that the Department of\nJustice knous hou to limit a plea agreement’s reach to\na single prosecutorial district rather than making it a\nnationwide restriction against future prosecution. Where,\nas here, the “United States ... agrees that it will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-\nconspirators” (App. 3la), without imposing any <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span>\nlimitation, no part of the Department of Justice may\ninstitute criminal charges against any co-conspirator in\nany district.\n\nThe Department of Justice directs prosecutors to be\ncareful when exercising their authority to bind the entire\nDepartment but there is no question that prosecutors\nhave the authority to do so. That they rarely exercise\nthis authority is not a ground for invalidating it, quite\nthe opposite.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo2o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000207.jpg": "7\nand on. See Robert H. Jackson, The Federal\nProsecutor, 24 J. AM. JUDICATURE Soc’y l8, l8\n(l94o).\nUnited States v. Osorto, 445 F. Supp. 3d lo3, lo9 (N.D.\nCal. 2o2o).\n\nTo permit the United States to escape the plain\nlanguage of its agreement in this case would work a\ndetriment on the entire plea system. This is of particular\nconcern given that the criminal justice system “is for\nthe most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.”\nMissouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. at l43-44. For the plea system\nto work in practice, defense counsel and defendants must\nbe able to rely on the writen promises made by the\ngovernment and trust that courts will honor and enforce\nthose promises doun the road, even when it means that\nthe Department must forego a meritorious prosecution.\n\nConsider a situation where a defendant agrees to\nplead guilty to a violent felony that will bring substantial\nprison time. He agrees to plead only because the\n“United States” promises in writing that it will not\ncharge any co-conspirators in the offense, including the\ndefendant’s brother, and because the plea agreement\ncontains no <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> or other limitation on that\npromise. The defendant should be able to rely on the\ngovernment’s bargained-for promise that he alone will\nsuffer incarceration. And a prosecutor in a different\ndistrict must not be permited to charge his brother with\nconspiracy to commit the same offense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo2o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000235.jpg": "l2\n(the USAO) and the corresponding <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> limita-\ntions of that agreement, as reflected in its promises re-\ngarding the prosecution of Epstein himself.\n\nPetitioner’s remaining arguments are likewise mis-\nplaced. Her effort (Pet. l5-l6) to link the coconspira-\ntors clause with other NPA provisions addressing\npotential civil suits under l8 U.S.C. 2255 (2oo6) is self-\ndefeating, since the later provisions reinforce the\nNPA’s limitation to the Southern District of Florida.\nSee Pet. App. 28a (providing that “Epstein will not con-\ntest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of Florida” in such suits). Sim-\nilarly unavailing is petitioner’s emphasis (Pet. l7) on\nlanguage in one draft of the NPA that would have ex-\npressly limited the coconspirators’ protection to the\nSouthern District of Florida. See Pet. App. ll7a. There\nis no indication that anyone involved in drafting the\nNPA understood the different versions of the cocon-\nspirators clause to have different <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scopes.\nSee id. at l22a-l23a; see also id. at l25a n.l25 (former\nFirst Assistant U.S. Atorney telling DOJ investigators\nthat “the NPA was not a ‘global resolution’ and other\nco-conspirators could have been prosecuted ‘by any\nother U.S. Atorney’s office in the country’”) (brackets\nomited). As the district court explained, an NPA “need\nnot painstakingly spell out ‘the Office of the United\nStates Atorney for Such-and-Such District’ in every in-\nstance to make clear that it applies only in the district\nwhere signed.” Jd. at 56a-57a.\n\nAt all events, the case-specific interpretation of a\nparticular NPA is not a mater that warrants this\nCourt’s review. See Sup. Ct. R. lo.

The NPA’s Prohibition on Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is Not\n\nLimited to the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA stands in contrast to the standard non-prosecution agreement used in this\nDistrict and other jurisdictions, which typically is explicitly limited to prohibit only prosecutions\nby the USAO for the district in which the plea is entered. The standard agreement in this District\ncontains the follouing language: “It is further understood that this Agreement does not bind any\nfederal, state, or local prosecuting authority other than this Office.” See, e.g., Perez v. United\nStates, Nos. l4 Civ. 846, o4 Cr. 937-l, 2ol5 WL 34l3596 , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). No such\nlanguage is included in the NPA. Moreover, unlike the standard agreement, the NPA refers\nseparately to “the United States” in some places and to the USAO-SDFL in others, in ways that\nmake clear that any reference to “the United States” was intended to refer to the government as a\nwhole, not merely the USAO-SDFL.\n\nl. The NPA is binding on the USAO in this District.\n\nThe government’s contention that the NPA does not bind the USAO in this District\ncannot be squared with the clear language of the co-conspirator immunity provision. On its face,\nthat provision does not limit the preclusive effect of the NPA as to potential co-conspirators to\nprosecutions in the SDFL. Indeed, consistent with Epstein’s desire to obtain the broadest\nimmunity possible, the NPA expressly provides that, in exchange for Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms and conditions therein, “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” with no express <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span>\nlimitation.

SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o.

Rather, “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly\ndesignated division, we look to that division to see whether there has been any unlawful or\nunconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added). Here,\nconsistent with the SDNY Grand Jury Plan, the venire for the grand jury that indicted the defendant\nwas drawn from the voter lists of the follouing counties: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,\nSullivan, and Dutchess. That is undoubtedly a “properly designated division” pursuant to the\nJSSA. As noted, the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ ll2(b). For purposes of the JSSA, district courts in such undivided districts have the authority\nto determine “divisions” comprised of “counties, parishes, or similar political subdivisions\nsurrounding the places where court is held.” 28 U.S.C. § l869(e). Accordingly, while the SDNY\nJury Plan neither creates nor ever uses the term “White Plains Division” or “Manhatan Division,”\nit contemplates Master Jury Wheels drawn from two <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> areas that satisfy the definition of\n“division” under the JSSA. Thus, in evaluating the defendant’s fair cross-section claim, this Court\nmust “look to that division” —the counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn—\n“to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna,\n68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added).\n\nIn the face of this authority, the defendant cites only two district court cases for the\nproposition that “community” for purposes of a fair cross-section claim is “widely understood to\nmean the district or division where the trial will be held.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 5 (emphasis added)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omited)).

See Section XI.A.l, supra (collecting\nexamples). That is entirely consistent not just with the foregoing authority, but also with the\nSouthern District’s Local Rules for the Division of Business. See SDNY Business Division Rules\nl8, l9. Criminal cases are also sometimes transferred to other Districts for trial. See Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 2l. Under the defendant’s approach, it would be impossible for prosecutors to determine ex\nante that that they were seeking an indictment from a grand jury drawn from a representative cross-\nsection of the relevant community, because they would not yet knou with certainty in which\ncommunity the case will be tried.\n\nThe defendant’s argument therefore boils doun to an unfounded complaint that it is “a\ndeviation from the established practice” to seek an indictment in a courthouse other than the one\nin which the case will likely be tried. (Def. Mot. 9 at 2). This argument is inconsistent with the\nforegoing law that the defendant has no right to jurors drawn from any particular <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> area\nwithin the district. See also Rosencrans v. United States, l65 U.S. 257, 26o-63 (l897) (finding no\nerror in grand jury returning indictment in a division different from the division in which the trial\nproceeded). It also finds no succor in the SDNY Business Division Rules, which vest no rights in\nany parties and, in any event, contemplate that judges may reassign cases from one courthouse to\nanother. And it falls exceedingly flat on the facts of this case. The Government did not forum\nshop to achieve some perceived advantage. Rather, it sought a timely indictment from a grand\njury in White Plains because it was the only grand jury with a quorum siting in the Southern\nDistrict on that date (a relatively rare situation created by an unprecedented public health crisis).\n\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of34\nits entirety, reads as follous: “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal\ncharges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Dkt.

Under Annabi,\nSalameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no\nrestriction on prosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of\nFlorida.

If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal.

Colton, 23l F.3d 89o, 9lo (4% Cir. 2ooo) (“T]he principle danger created\nby multiplicity is that a defendant will receive multiple punishments for a single offense.”’).\n\nThe offense in a charge of conspiracy is “the agreement or confederation of the\nconspirators to commit one or more unlawful acts.” Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d at 3o7 (quoting\n(Braverman v. United States, 3l7 U.S. 49, 53 (l942)). Therefore, “[a] single agreement to\ncommit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy,” but “multiple agreements to commit separate\ncrimes constitute multiple conspiracies.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 57o-\n7l (l989).

These factors include:\n\n(l) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments;\n(2) the overlap of participants;\n(3) the overlap of time;\n(4) the similarity of operation;\n(5) the existence of common overt acts;\n(6) the <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope of the alleged conspiracies or location where\novert acts occurred;\n(7) common objectives; and\n(8) the degree of interdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8949", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 28 of 37\nof the same overarching conspiracy charged in Counts One and Three, with the same co-\ndefendants, the same method of operation, and the same objectives.

Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and <span class=\"highlight\">Geographic</span> Scope\n\nThe government’s charging theory in the Indictment and its presentation of the evidence\nat trial was that Epstein and Maxwell engaged in a single criminal scheme with a common\nmethod of operation to recruit and “groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity\nin multiple locations, including Epstein’s residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Indeed, in summarizing the evidence for the jury, the government\nhighlighted that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used the same “playbook” with all four of the accusers\nand argued that this common method of operation was one of the principal reasons that the jury\ncould convict Ms. Maxwell on all counts:\n\nThe second reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the same\n\nplaybook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The\n\nsimilarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are\nincredibly pouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you\n\nabout the playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n\nTr. 2848:l6-22 (emphasis added); see also Tr. 2853:l4-l6 (“The paterns you saw throughout\nthis trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways that you knou\nthat Maxwell is guilty.”’).\n\nThe common “playbook” that the government described started by targeting vulnerable\nkids, like the four accusers, who all came from single-mother households with financial or other\nhardships. Tr. 2849:l8-285o:l7. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell then isolated the girls from their\nparents and began “grooming” them for sexual abuse by taking an interest in their lives, making\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8952", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 27 of5l\noffense charged in another count.” United States v. Rigas, 28l F. Supp. 2d 66o, 666 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo3) (citing Chacko, l69 F.3d at l46). With respect to conspiracy counts, if the two counts\ncharge distinct conspiracies, “there is no double jeopardy problem regardless of an overt act or\nother evidentiary overlap.” Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8o. In the Second Circuit, courts apply the\nfactors set forth in United States v. Korfant to determine whether two conspiracy counts are\ndistinct. /d. at l8o-8l (citing United States v. Korfant, 77l F.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir. l985)). The\nfactors include “the criminal offenses charged, overlap of participants, overlap of time, similarity\nof operation, common overt acts, <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope, common objectives, and degree of\ninterdependence.” United States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Korfant,\n77l F.2d at 662); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8l.\n\nWhen applying the Korfant factors, the Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘no dominant\nfactor or single touchstone determines whether’ the compared conspiracies are in law and fact the\nsame.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 668 (2d Cir. l994)). Moreover, “[alt\na certain level of generality,’ the fact that two conspiracies ‘overlap with respect to a number of\ncharacteristics, including time frame, <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> locale, participants, and criminal objective’ does\nnot negate the existence of two conspiracies if ‘[t]here exist sufficient distinctions between the\nschemes charged.” Guzman, 7 F. App’x at 55 (quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nCounts Three and Five charged different offenses. The Court should reject the defendant’s\n\nmultiplicity claim and enter judgment on Counts Three and Five.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9589", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 29of5l\n\nHere, not only are Counts Three and Five predicated on different statutes, but the legal\ndistinctions between these counts are substantial. First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a passenger\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth certificate\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 32 of5l\nwhich Kellen took nude photographs of Carolyn for Epstein. (Tr. l529). In short, the S2\nIndictment charged—and the proof at trial established—that there was an additional participant in\nthe sex trafficking conspiracy who was not involved in the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\n4. Overlap of Time\n\nCount Three charged conduct spanning from l994 to 2oo4. Count Five charged conduct\nspanning from 2ool to 2oo4. Of the multiple overt acts charged in Count Three of the S2\nIndictment, only one occurred during the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five: an\novert act regarding efforts to solicit Carolyn to travel with the defendant and Epstein. (Dkt. No.\nl87, { l9(e)). Aside from that single overt act, no other overt act charged in Count Three occurred\nwithin the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five. Put simply, the gravamen of the\noffense conduct in Count Three occurred in the l99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count\nFive took place in the 2ooos. Thus, although there is some degree of overlap in time frames\nbetween the two counts, it is minimal at best. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a claim of\nmultiplicity, or at best is neutral.\n\n5. <span class=\"highlight\">Geographic</span> Scope\n\nAlthough the evidence at trial concerned events in multiple states, at Epstein’s multiple\nproperties, the offense conduct in Count Three concerned transporting minors from Florida to New\nYork, for purposes of sexually abusing victims in New York. By contrast, Count Five charged a\nsex trafficking conspiracy which, as the Court instructed the jury, could be established by proof of\nconduct that had a minimal effect on interstate commerce, irrespective of whether victims crossed\nstate lines. (Tr. 3o4l-42). As a result, the conspiracy in Count Three was focused on travel to\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9594", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 33 of5l\nNew York, whereas the conspiracy charged in Count Five largely concerned conduct that took\nplace in Florida. Although the conspiracy overlapped in <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope, the locus of each count\nwas distinct and weighs against a claim of multiplicity.\n\n6. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of Interdependence\n\nFinally, the conspiracies charged in Counts Three and Five were fundamentally\nindependent schemes, with different objectives and modes of operation. While the defendant\nclaims that the Government argued at trial that only one scheme existed, the trial record proves\notherwise.\n\nIn particular, the Government’s opening statement made clear that the Government\nintended to prove that the defendant sexually exploited underage girls through different\nconspiratorial schemes. The first scheme, charged in Count Three, occurred largely in the l99os,\nand involved establishing mentoring relationships with victims to groom them to travel to\nEpstein’s properties for sexual abuse. See Tr. 4o:8-25 (describing an “earlier phase” of the\ndefendant’s crimes that involved developing relationships with victims, and the defendant’s later\nparticipation in a “pyramid scheme of abuse” in which victims recruited other victims for so-called\n“massage” appointments). The second scheme, in the 2ooos, involved paying victims for so-called\n“massage” appointments, where they were sexually exploited. /d. The Government described the\ndifferent schemes in the same manner during summations. See Tr. 2885-87 (describing the\ntimeline of events, and the shift between an earlier scheme and a later pyramid scheme involving\nvictims recruiting victims).\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9595", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2 of 24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

In fact, the conduct in the\n2ooos that Carolyn described was no different than the conduct in the l99os that Jane described.\nLike Carolyn, Jane testified that Epstein gave her money after almost every sexual encounter\nwith him at this Palm Beach residence, which would support a sex trafficking charge. (Tr. 3ol-\no2). Indeed, the government concedes that the only reason it did not expand Count Five to\ninclude Jane and Annie Farmer’s abuse (as it had expanded Counts One and Three to include\nCarolyn’s abuse) was that the sex trafficking statute was not enacted until after their abuse had\noccurred. (Opp. at 28). Had that legal impediment not existed, the government could have, and\nno doubt would have, broadened the date range of Count Five to l994-2oo4, as it had done with\nCounts One and Three, and included overt acts related to Jane. Instead, the government included\na more narrou sex trafficking count based primarily on Carolyn’s allegations from 2ool-2oo4,\nbut still framed all of the charges in the Indictment as the product of a single, decade-long\nscheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to “groom” and recruit minor girls to be sexually\nabused at Epstein’s various residences from l994 to 2oo4. (See Ind. 4 l-2, Overview Section).\nAccordingly, the offenses charged in the Indictment support a finding of multiplicity.\n\nB. Overlap in Participants, Time, and <span class=\"highlight\">Geographic</span> Scope\n\nThe government makes a half-hearted atempt to deny the obvious overlap between\nCounts Three and Five in participants, time period, and <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope. (Opp. at 3o-32). For\nexample, the government argues that some “but importantly, not all” of the participants in the\ntwo conspiracies overlapped, and notes that Sarah Kellen, who scheduled massage appointments\nfor Epstein in Palm Beach, only appeared in the 2ooos during the time period of the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. (Opp. at 3o-3l).

(/d.) The addition of Sarah Kellen as a co-conspirator touards the end of the\nconspiracy does not create multiple conspiracies. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385,\n387 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy\ninto multiple conspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved\nthroughout the duration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nThe government also argues that although the time period of Count Five (2ool-2oo4) was\nentirely contained within the time period of Count Three (l994-2oo4), there was no significant\ntemporal overlap because “the gravamen of the offense conduct for Count Three occurred in the\nl99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count Five took place in the 2ooos.” (Opp. at 3l).\nThat is non-sensical. Count Three charges a conspiracy lasting continuously from l994-2oo4.\nJust because three of the witnesses testified about conduct in the l99os and one of the witnesses\ntestified about conduct in the 2ooos, that does not mean that the l99os conduct was somehou\nmore important or more relevant to Count Three than the 2ooos conduct. As charged, the\nconspiracy spanned the entire time period. Hence, the temporal overlap between Count Three\nand Count Five was not “minimal,” as the government contends. (Opp. at 3l). It was complete.\nThe time period of Count Five was entirely contained within, and overlapped with, the time\nperiod of Count Three.\n\nFinally, the government disingenuously argues that the <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope of the two\nconspiracies did not overlap because Count Three “was focused on travel to New York,”\nwhereas Count Five “largely concerned conduct that took place in Florida.” (Opp. at 3l-32).\nHere, the government is talking out of both sides of its mouth. The government argued\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 24\nrepeatedly, and the Court agreed, that evidence of travel to locations other than New York, and\nsexual abuse that occurred in those locations, was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies. As a\nresult, the jury heard a great deal of testimony from Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer, as well as\nother evidence, about conduct that took place in Epstein’s residences in New Mexico, London,\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, and, of course, Florida. Indeed, a large portion of Jane’s testimony,\nwhich was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies, described incidents of sexual abuse in\nEpstein’s residence in Palm Beach that involved no interstate travel. (Tr. 298-3l5).\nAccordingly, the <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope of Count Five (Florida) was included within the <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span>\nscope of Count Three.\n\nCount Five did not describe a separate, independent conspiracy. Rather, it was a smaller\nsubset of the broader overarching conspiracy charged in Count Three. Counts Three and Five\nare therefore multiplicitous. See United States v. Calderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47-48 (2d Cir. l992)\n(finding two conspiracies were multiplicitous where, among other things, the time frame and\n<span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope of one conspiracy was entirely contained within the other conspiracy and the\ncore participants were the same); see also id. at 48 (“The Government cannot be permited to\nretry defendants on smaller and smaller conspiracies, wholly contained within the scope of a\nlarge conspiracy, until it finds one small enough to be proved to the satisfaction of a jury.’’).\n\nC. Common Overt Acts\n\nThe government argues that the lack of common overt acts between Count Three and\nCount Five indicates that they were different conspiracies. (Opp. at 3o). As we explained in our\ninitial Motion, because Count Five was based on Carolyn’s allegations and did not involve Jane,\nKate, or Annie Farmer, that count alleged overt acts specific to Carolyn that were not alleged in\nCount Three. (Mot. at 24; Ind. 9] 25a-d, l9a-e).

Under Annabi,\nSalameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no\nrestriction on prosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of\nFlorida.

The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida.

A previous version of the co-conspirator\nlanguage limited it to the Southern District of Florida\nbefore it was amended to refer more broadly to the\n“United States,” and the co-conspirator clause was\nrelocated in the document.

The NPA did not pose an\nimpediment to this indictment because Epstein’s\nprotection therein had been limited to charges brought\nin the Southern District of Florida. Epstein died while\nincarcerated on August lo, 2ol9.\n\nOne year later, after Epstein died in jail, Ghislaine\nMaxwell was indicted in the Southern District of\nNew York for her alleged actions as a co-conspirator\nof Epstein, on charges that were the same as had\nbeen brought against Epstein. Initially, Maxwell was\ncharged with crimes in the l994 to l997 timeframe,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000120.tif": "57a\nevery instance to make clear that it applies only in the\ndistrict where signed.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite\nconclusion. The provision of the NPA dealing with\nco-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds\nU.S. Atorneys in other districts. It does not expressly\nstate that it applies in other districts. The relevant\nlanguage, in its entirety, reads as follous: “the United\nStates also agrees that it will not institute any crimi-\nnal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” Dkt. No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi, Salameh,\nand Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States”\nagrees not to prosecute implies no restriction on\nprosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to\nprosecution in the Southern District of Florida. The\nfirst states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida will defer “prosecution in this\nDistrict” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt.\nNo. l42-l at 2. The second states that no prosecution\n“will be instituted in this District, and the charges\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed” after he\nfulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator\nprovision must mean that it lacks any geographical\nlimitation. If anything, that language reflects that the\nNPA’s scope was expressly limited to the Southern\nDistrict of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone\n“affirmatively apparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,—\nthat the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scope in the single sentence on\nthe prosecution of co-conspirators without clearly so\nsaying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text,\nMaxwell turns to its negotiation history.

The government’s promises, made in return\nfor demanding the defendant’s waiver of constitutional\nrights, should be rigorously enforced. Yet the louer court\npermited the government to escape its promises and\nincorrectly limited the scope of the non-prosecution and\nplea agreement (NPA) well beyond its plain language.\n\nThe intentionally broad scope of this NPA may be\nsurprising in retrospect but that does not change the\nwords on the page. Indeed, a survey of plea agreements\nfrom across the country shous that the Department of\nJustice knous hou to limit a plea agreement’s reach to\na single prosecutorial district rather than making it a\nnationwide restriction against future prosecution. Where,\nas here, the “United States ... agrees that it will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-\nconspirators” (App. 3la), without imposing any <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span>\nlimitation, no part of the Department of Justice may\ninstitute criminal charges against any co-conspirator in\nany district.\n\nThe Department of Justice directs prosecutors to be\ncareful when exercising their authority to bind the entire\nDepartment but there is no question that prosecutors\nhave the authority to do so. That they rarely exercise\nthis authority is not a ground for invalidating it, quite\nthe opposite.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo2o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000207.tif": "7\nand on. See Robert H. Jackson, The Federal\nProsecutor, 24 J. AM. JUDICATURE Soc’y l8, l8\n(l94o).\nUnited States v. Osorto, 445 F. Supp. 3d lo3, lo9 (N.D.\nCal. 2o2o).\n\nTo permit the United States to escape the plain\nlanguage of its agreement in this case would work a\ndetriment on the entire plea system. This is of particular\nconcern given that the criminal justice system “is for\nthe most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.”\nMissouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. at l43-44. For the plea system\nto work in practice, defense counsel and defendants must\nbe able to rely on the writen promises made by the\ngovernment and trust that courts will honor and enforce\nthose promises doun the road, even when it means that\nthe Department must forego a meritorious prosecution.\n\nConsider a situation where a defendant agrees to\nplead guilty to a violent felony that will bring substantial\nprison time. He agrees to plead only because the\n“United States” promises in writing that it will not\ncharge any co-conspirators in the offense, including the\ndefendant’s brother, and because the plea agreement\ncontains no <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> or other limitation on that\npromise. The defendant should be able to rely on the\ngovernment’s bargained-for promise that he alone will\nsuffer incarceration. And a prosecutor in a different\ndistrict must not be permited to charge his brother with\nconspiracy to commit the same offense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo2o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000235.tif": "l2\n(the USAO) and the corresponding <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> limita-\ntions of that agreement, as reflected in its promises re-\ngarding the prosecution of Epstein himself.\n\nPetitioner’s remaining arguments are likewise mis-\nplaced. Her effort (Pet. l5-l6) to link the coconspira-\ntors clause with other NPA provisions addressing\npotential civil suits under l8 U.S.C. 2255 (2oo6) is self-\ndefeating, since the later provisions reinforce the\nNPA’s limitation to the Southern District of Florida.\nSee Pet. App. 28a (providing that “Epstein will not con-\ntest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of Florida” in such suits). Sim-\nilarly unavailing is petitioner’s emphasis (Pet. l7) on\nlanguage in one draft of the NPA that would have ex-\npressly limited the coconspirators’ protection to the\nSouthern District of Florida. See Pet. App. ll7a. There\nis no indication that anyone involved in drafting the\nNPA understood the different versions of the cocon-\nspirators clause to have different <span class=\"highlight\">geographic</span> scopes.\nSee id. at l22a-l23a; see also id. at l25a n.l25 (former\nFirst Assistant U.S. Atorney telling DOJ investigators\nthat “the NPA was not a ‘global resolution’ and other\nco-conspirators could have been prosecuted ‘by any\nother U.S. Atorney’s office in the country’”) (brackets\nomited). As the district court explained, an NPA “need\nnot painstakingly spell out ‘the Office of the United\nStates Atorney for Such-and-Such District’ in every in-\nstance to make clear that it applies only in the district\nwhere signed.” Jd. at 56a-57a.\n\nAt all events, the case-specific interpretation of a\nparticular NPA is not a mater that warrants this\nCourt’s review. See Sup. Ct. R. lo. And that is especially\ntrue where “district court and court of appeals are in\nagreement as to what conclusion the record requires.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo235", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022550.tif": "Page l58\nl I'm nervous about the state of the ocean.\n?
