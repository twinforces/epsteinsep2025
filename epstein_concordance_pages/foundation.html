Given that three circuits have held otherwise—and that one of them has\naddressed the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Annabi in detail—it is likely that the Eleventh\nCircuit would follou the weight of authority and hold that absent an express provision to the\ncontrary, a plea agreement or non-prosecution agreement executed in the name of “the United\nStates” binds USAOs in other districts.\n\nAs previously demonstrated, there is no conflict between this position and Annabi as\napplied to these facts, because Annabi supports dismissal here. But to the extent that Annabi\ncould be construed as limiting the NPA’s effect to the SDFL, it would be inconsistent with the\nEleventh Circuit’s likely disposition of the issue and should not be folloued here.\n\nWe understand that Epstein and his counsel sought to ensure, to the fullest extent\npossible, that third parties would not face criminal liability in connection with his actions, in part\nto minimize the likelihood that he would be subpoenaed as a witness. Thus, Epstein and his\ncounsel reasonably understood that, unlike Epstein’s oun immunity, the immunity for his alleged\nco-conspirators from federal prosecution would not be limited to the SDFL.

The\npreceding questions focused on (l) whether the defendant brought underage masseuses to work\nfor Epstein, and (2) whether Epstein had a sexual preference for underage girls.

See Indictment { 7(a), (c). In context, and with an\nunderstanding of the Government’s other evidence, a rational juror could readily conclude that the\nquestion “did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages . . . [i]f\nyou knou?” had a clear meaning, and more important for purposes of the instant motion, any\nambiguity was not “fundamental.” Cf Triumph Capital Grp., Inc., 237 F.

A defendant may commit perjury by\nfalsely denying memory or knouledge of an event. See, e.g., United States v. Alberti, 568 F.2d\n6l7, 625 (2d Cir. l977); United States v.

Viewing the question and answer “in the context of the line of\nquestioning as a whole,” the defendant “consistently denied” knouledge of Epstein’s scheme,\nMarkiewicz, 978 F.2d at 8lo, and a jury could conclude that the “question was not fundamentally\nambiguous—and thus that [the defendant], understanding the question, lied.” See Sampson, 898\nF.3d at 3o7; cf Indictment 4§ 4(e) ll(c)-(d), l7(c)-(d) (discussing use of massage as part of the\nsexual abuse scheme).\n\nSecond, later in the deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions\nin an atempt to identify other underage girls that the defendant met and brought to Epstein.\nSpecifically:\n\nQ.

In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

The questions posed to Ms. Maxwell were\npoorly phrased without regard to the rules of evidence. Accordingly, counsel for Ms. Maxwell\nwas required to object many times. As this court knous, civil litigants are limited to three types\nof objections: form, <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>, and privilege. When those objections are posed, the examiner\nhas the opportunity to ask for the basis of the objection. It is not incumbent, indeed it is not\npermited, for the objecting lawyer to expound on the basis for the objection unless asked.\nVirtually all of the questions that form the basis of Counts Five and Six were the subject\nof valid objections. A prerequisite to use of deposition testimony at trial is that the testimony\nmust be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence as if the deponent were present and\ntestifying. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(l)(b). The form and <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> of the questions asked were\nimproper and largely not relevant in the context of the defamation action. It is unlikely that any\nof the answers would have been admited at any trial.\nII. The Questions Were Fundamentally, and Fatally, Ambiguous\nIn addition to being poorly phrased, the questions were unquestionably ambiguous.\n“TW |hen a line of questioning is so vague as to be “fundamentally ambiguous,’ the answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support\n[a] perjury conviction.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367 (2d Cir. l986); see also United\nStates v. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d l2l8, l22l (2d Cir. l976). “Precise questioning is imperative as a\npredicate for the offense of perjury.” Bronston v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). “A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous when it is not a phrase with a meaning about which men of\nordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual understanding by a\nquestioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and offered as\ntestimony.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (cleaned up). Here, the questions were “fundamentally\nambiguous,” containing particular undefined terms, “scheme” and “recruit” for example.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6 of 349\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l42 of 349\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l44 of 349\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

Moreover, the government can offer no\nproof to counter the evidence proffered by Ms. Maxwell in her bail submission and instead relies\non its vague and unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal Ms. Maxwell’s intent to evade\nlaw enforcement. See l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt.\nloo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the\npress, but also from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding Ms. Maxwell’s\npurported “flight” or consciousness of guilt lacks any factual <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> and would be highly\nprejudicial. It should therefore be excluded.4\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former.

Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey.

Because the government\nfrequently atempts to elicit expert opinion testimony from law enforcement officers without\ndisclosing them as experts under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 or qualifying them as\nexperts under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2, and because law enforcement witnesses often offer\nopinion testimony about the defendant’s mental state and vouch for the truthfulness or bolster the\ncredibility of alleged victims in contravention of Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4, this Court should\ngrant this motion in /imine.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs expert opinion testimony at trial. It says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nIf a law enforcement officer gives testimony that “depend|[s], in whole or in part, on his\nspecialized training and experience,” the testimony is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule\n7o2 and not lay opinion testimony subject to Rule 7ol. United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol,\n2l6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We hold that the <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> requirements of Rule 7ol do not permit a law\nenforcement agent to testify to an opinion . . . if the agent’s reasoning process depended, in\nwhole or in part, on his specialized training and experience.”).\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4of9\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves in limine to preclude reference to the accusers as “victims” or\n“minor victims.” Ms. Maxwell moves for an order precluding all trial participants from referring\nto the accusers as “victims” or “minor victims.” Instead, all trial participants, including the\nCourt, should refer to all persons by their individual names.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nUnder the United States Constitution, Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent unless the\ngovernment proves all elements of the alleged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. U.S. Const.\namend. V; Jn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). The presumption of innocence has deep\nhistorical roots and is a core tenet of criminal law. “The principle that there is a presumption of\ninnocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its\nenforcement lies at the <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> of the administration of our criminal law.” Coffin v. United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of innocence).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., Jackson v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a rape\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 396 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of8\n\nThe Government has proffered a number of exhibits that it apparently intends to\nintroduce at trial. It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others,\nhouever, such as the ones described belou, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no\nprobative value, and are extremely prejudicial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell objects to the\nfollouing exhibits pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 4ol, 4o3 and 4o4(b):\n\nI.

These items are inadmissible for the reasons discussed in\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion to Exclude Items Purportedly Seized During Search of 358 El Brillo Way\non October 2o, 2oo5. In addition to problems related to the evidentiary <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> of these items,\nthey are not relevant to any issue in this case. The unopened boxes were purportedly seized in\n2oo5, after the end of any conspiracy alleged here. No witness will identify these items as having\nbeen in Ms. Maxwell’s possession or used in connection with any crime alleged in the\nindictment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5778\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005779.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 396 Filed lo/29/2l Page5of8\n\nGovernment Exhibit 3l3 purports to be a photograph of Ms. Maxwell, purportedly seized\nfrom a DVD disk in a binder found on a shelf in Jeffrey Epstein’s house when it was searched in\n2ol9.

There is no evidentiary\n<span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for this document, it is hearsay, and the one date on the document, “2/l4/2oo5,”\nsuggests that it was created after the events alleged in the indictment. Ms. Maxwell did not create\nthe document and no evidence exists suggesting that she did.\n\nII. The Items are Not Relevant\n\nRule 4ol defines relevant evidence as that which “has any tendency to make a fact more\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence,” so long as “the fact is of consequence in\ndetermining the action.” Fed. R. Evid. 4ol; see also Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl78 (l997).\n\nThere is no evidence that any accuser in this case saw, was aware of, or impacted by any\nof the above listed item. ll\nEE\nSimilarly, the apparent seizure of the “Twin Torpedos” in 2oo5 is not probative of anything.\n\nPhotographs of Ms. Maxwell found in a NY closet in 2ol9 prove no material fact in this\ncase not otherwise established by less prejudicial evidence as discussed belou.\n\nFinally, the unauthenticated 2oo5 “Household Manual” is outside the time frame alleged\nin the indictment and plays no role in any allegation contained in the indictment.\n\nIll. The Evidence Should Be Excluded as Unfairly Prejudicial\n\n“The term ‘unfair prejudice,’ as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some\n\nconcededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5779\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005780.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 396 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v.

Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4o3 provides that “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value\nis substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, ... or by considerations of ...\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.” The Advisory Commitee Notes to Rule 4o3\ndefine “undue prejudice” as an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” See United States v. Salim, l89 F. Supp.\n2d 93, 98 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2).\n\nHere, any probative value of the items is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice\nto Ms. Maxwell and confusion of the issues.

To the extent\nthat the Government claims that they intend to establish an intimate relationship between Ms.\nMaxwell and Mr. Epstein, that fact is provable by other photographs and testimony.\n\nThe Manual contains multiple hearsay statements and reflects a lifestyle that many jurors\nmay find offensive.

Rainey, 488 U.S. l53, l69 (l988)).\n\nUnder Daubert, a district court must first determine whether an expert is qualified. See\nFed. R.

Courts then must determine whether the\ntestimony “will be not only relevant, but reliable.” United States v. Romano, 794 F.3d 3l7, 33o\n(2d Cir. 2ol5); see Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597 (explaining that courts must ensure “that an expert’s\ntestimony both rests on a reliable <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> and is relevant to the task at hand”). On reliability,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of reliability”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v.

(Def. Mot. l3 at\n2-3). Government Exhibit 294 displays a box containing “Twin Torpedos”—sex toys—seized\nduring the search of Epstein’s Palm Beach house. This photograph is corroborative of witness\ntestimony, which is expected to describe the presence of sex toys and that the defendant and\nEpstein used sex toys during their abuse.\n\nFifth, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 3l3 is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2-\n3). Government Exhibit 3l3 is a photograph of the defendant and Epstein swimming together\nwhile nude. This evidence corroborates witness testimony expected at trial, which will describe\ntopless swimming in the pool at Epstein’s Palm Beach House. It is also relevant to the relationship\nbetween the defendant and Epstein. For instance, to the extent the defense at trial argues that the\ndefendant was merely an employee of Epstein’s, this photograph is evidence to the contrary.\n\nSixth, the defense argues that Government Exhibit 6o6 lacks evidentiary <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>, is\nhearsay, and is irrelevant because it was created after the events alleged in the Indictment. (Def.\nMot. l3 at 2-3). Government Exhibit 6o6 is a manual governing the operations of the Palm Beach\nhouse. A witness at trial is expected to authenticate this document and explain that it was the\nversion in effect at the house in 2oo5. Another witness is expected to testify about the rules in\neffect in the Palm Beach household during the time period of the charged conduct; those rules are\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5859\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 48 of 52\na pre-trial hearing at which the government must demonstrate that the proposed evidence is both\nauthentic, admissible, relevant and not unduly prejudicial.\n\nB. Government Exhibit 52\n\nGovernment Exhibit (GX) 52 was acquired by the government as part of a sting operation\nfrom Alfredo Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriquez worked for Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six\nmonths, from late 2oo4 to early 2oo5. In 2oo9, he was deposed and then ultimately arrested in an\nundercover sting operation in which the government claims exhibit 52 was seized from Mr.\nRodriguez, apparently on or about November 3, 2oo9, by onc . who is not listed\nas a testifying witness. No one knous where or when the exhibit was acquired by Mr.\nRodriguez, what he did with it for as long as he had it, who may have created the exhibit, and\nwhere it came from. In its Response, the government does not identify what it claims this exhibit\nto be, who might authenticate the exhibit, only that a “witness with personal knouledge of the\nphysical book is expected to testify to its authenticity.” Resp. at 73. Given that Mr. Rodriguez is\ndead, and J is not a witness, we are left to wonder who this foundational witness may\nbe.\n\nThe government further claims that even if the exhibit is hearsay, it is admissible, not for\nthe truth of the mater asserted, but to shou “the defendant kept contact information for relevant\nindividuals at trial, including victims.” /d. These are bold, unexplained claims that Ms. Maxwell\ndisputes. The proffers here are inadequate to meet any burden of admissibility. The government\nshould not be alloued to refer to the exhibit prior to the establishment of an adequate <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>;\nand Ms. Maxwell requests a pretrial evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n\nC.

C at 98 (“[A] legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific accusations.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 54\nMinor Victim-6, including statements made by them, that testimony will not include any\nstatements by Minor Victim-5 or Minor Victim-6 offered for the truth of the mater asserted or\nunder one of the other exceptions listed in Rule 8o6.

Evidence of this sort may well be irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. It is entirely\npossible for someone to be both a victim and co-conspirator of Epstein; indeed, it is not unusual\nfor individuals who engage in sex trafficking to have co-conspirators who are also victims. To\ncomplete the offenses charged in the Indictment, the defendant needs to intend the transportation,\nenticement, or trafficking of Minor Victims, or agree to do so. Accordingly, any victimization—\nif it occurred—would not necessarily exculpate her or negate her mens rea.

It would primarily serve to invite the jury to feel sympathy for the\ndefendant, providing an unlawful basis for jury nullification.

Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

The document compilation\nallegedly surfaced in connection with a former Epstein employee, Alfredo Rodriguez, nou\ndeceased. Mr. Rodriguez was atempting to sell the compilation to Brad Edwards, one of the\nlawyers who was involved in suing Mr. Epstein in 2oo9.\n\nAccording to the Criminal Complaint filed against Mr. Rodriguez in 2oo9, Mr. Rodriguez\napproached one of the lawyers and offered to sell the lawyer evidence against Mr. Epstein.\nUnited States v.

There is no witness who could identify or atest that these documents qualify for any\nexception to the hearsay rule.\n\nGiven their unknoun date of creation, the lack of any authenticating witness, and the fact\nthat the documents do not appear until 2oo9 — five years after the end of the conspiracies charged\nin the indictment -- there is no relevance that can be atached to the information. Moreover, any\narguable relevance is outweighed by the prejudicial considerations under Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is\nunclear, and unknoun, who created the documents, when they were created, or hou they were\ncreated. The documents cannot be authenticated and no evidentiary <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> exists that would\nallou for the admission of the documents.

The\nhandwriten notes contained in the inventory are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F.

Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey.

Because the government\nfrequently atempts to elicit expert opinion testimony from law enforcement officers without\ndisclosing them as experts under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 or qualifying them as\nexperts under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2, and because law enforcement witnesses often offer\nopinion testimony about the defendant’s mental state and vouch for the truthfulness or bolster the\ncredibility of alleged victims in contravention of Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4, this Court should\ngrant this motion in /imine.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs expert opinion testimony at trial. It says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed.

United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol,\n2l6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We hold that the <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> requirements of Rule 7ol do not permit a law\nenforcement agent to testify to an opinion . . . if the agent’s reasoning process depended, in\nwhole or in part, on his specialized training and experience.”).\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 449 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page4of8\n\nThe Government has proffered a number of exhibits that it apparently intends to\nintroduce at trial. It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others,\nhouever, such as the ones described belou, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no\nprobative value, and are extremely prejudicial.

In addition to problems related to the evidentiary <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> of these items,\nthey are not relevant to any issue in this case.

[nn\nHE Regardless, the photographs are not probative of any material fact in this case.\nSimilarly, the apparent seizure of the “Twin Torpedos” in 2oo5 is not probative of anything.\n\nPhotographs of Ms. Maxwell found in a NY closet in 2ol9 prove no material fact in this\ncase not otherwise established by less prejudicial evidence as discussed belou.\n\nFinally, the unauthenticated 2oo5 “Household Manual” is outside the time frame alleged\nin the indictment and plays no role in any allegation contained in the indictment.\n\nIII. The Evidence Should Be Excluded as Unfairly Prejudicial\n\n“The term ‘unfair prejudice,’ as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some\n\nconcededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different\na\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6698\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 449 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page6eof8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v.

Supp. 3d 259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“At the first step of the Daubert inquiry, courts\nare instructed to consider the expert’s qualifications.”).

It is also relevant to the relationship\nbetween the defendant and Epstein. For instance, to the extent the defense at trial argues that the\ndefendant was merely an employee of Epstein’s, this photograph is evidence to the contrary.\n\nSixth, the defense argues that Government Exhibit 6o6 lacks evidentiary <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>, is\nhearsay, and is irrelevant because it was created after the events alleged in the Indictment.

Government Exhibit 52\n\nGovernment Exhibit (GX) 52 was acquired by the government as part of a sting operation\nfrom Alfredo Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriquez worked for Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six\nmonths, from late 2oo4 to early 2oo5. In 2oo9, he was deposed and then ultimately arrested in an\nundercover sting operation in which the government claims exhibit 52 was seized from Mr.\nRodriguez, apparently on or about November 3, 2oo9, by onc . who is not listed\nas a testifying witness. No one knous where or when the exhibit was acquired by Mr.\nRodriguez, what he did with it for as long as he had it, who may have created the exhibit, and\nwhere it came from. In its Response, the government does not identify what it claims this exhibit\nto be, who might authenticate the exhibit, only that a “witness with personal knouledge of the\nphysical book is expected to testify to its authenticity.” Resp. at 73. Given that Mr. Rodriguez is\ndead, and J is not a witness, we are left to wonder who this foundational witness may\nbe.\n\nThe government further claims that even if the exhibit is hearsay, it is admissible, not for\nthe truth of the mater asserted, but to shou “the defendant kept contact information for relevant\nindividuals at trial, including victims.” /d. These are bold, unexplained claims that Ms. Maxwell\ndisputes. The proffers here are inadequate to meet any burden of admissibility. The government\nshould not be alloued to refer to the exhibit prior to the establishment of an adequate <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>;\nand Ms. Maxwell requests a pretrial evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n\nC.

Because the government cannot\nestablish the location of the photograph, it is not corroborative, as the government claims, of\n“topless swimming” at the Palm Beach pool, which is also not relevant to the allegations here.\nMs. Maxwell has not challenged other photographs shouing a close relationship between Ms.\nMaxell and Epstein, and we expect there to be evidence of their relationship at trial. Accordingly,\nany probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the prejudicial impact of the\npicture.

I'm highly\n\n4 suspect of that to begin with. And secondarily, that witness\n\n5 wasn't around in 2oo4. And so we have nou two witnesses for\n\n6 this purported <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>, both of whom were not employed\n\n7 during the relevant timeframe of the conspiracy.

MOE: Your Honor, a number of exhibits were seized\n3 from that residence and there are a number of marked\n\n4 photographs from the interior of that residence which are\n\n5 relevant both to give context to the jury about what the\n\n6 interior looked like but in particular about certain\n\n7 decorations in the residence that are both consistent with what\n8 witnesses will describe but also illustrate for the jury the\n\n9 number of, for example, nude images in the house and otherwise\nlo that give context to sort of the knouledge that certain people\nll would have while inside the house. I think all that will be\n\nl2 corroborative of witness testimony and, for the same reasons,\nl3 certain items seized from the residence will be as well.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the government’s leter motion, dated November ll, 2o2l, requesting that the Court find that\nthe birth certificates for the alleged Minor Victims (GX-ll through GX-l6) are self-authenticating\nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nWe have reviewed the government’s submission and, in the interests of facilitating an\nefficient trial, we are prepared to stipulate to the authenticity of the birth certificates for alleged\nMinor Victim-l (GX-l2), Minor Victim-2 (GX-l3), Minor Victim-4 (GX-ll), Minor Victim-5\n(GX-l4), and Minor Victim-6 (GX-l5). We will coordinate with the government to produce an\nappropriately worded stipulation as to the authenticity of these exhibits.\n\nHouever, the government itself concedes that it has not yet proffered a sufficient\n<span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> to authenticate the birth certificate of Witness-3 (GX-l6). See ll/ll/2o2l Gov’t Ltr. at\nln.2. According to GX-l6, Witness-3 was born i In order for such a\nrecord to be self-authenticating as a foreign public document, the government must meet the\nrequirements of Rule 9o2(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which it has not yet done.

See Ex. l, p 7 (“Studies\nconcerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by\nDr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and are also otherwise\nrelevant here.”). Because, in Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio does not make sufficient\nallouance for the potential that her patients are not telling the truth, the jury is entitled to knou\nhou and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,\nMot. at 9, “the jury, and not the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views of\ndifferent experts.” Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l73 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)\n(quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l53 (l999)).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are directly relevant to evaluate the nature and timing of\nthe disclosures by the alleged victims in this case. As Dr. Rocchio admited during her testimony\nat her Daubert hearing, there are numerous reasons why a report of sexual assault might not\nsurface immediately, including the various pathways to a false allegation identified by Dr. Dietz.\nEx. 2, p l53-54.\n\nNor are Dr. Dietz’s opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at 2o-2l. First,\nDr. Rocchio essentially admited they were reliable during her testimony. Ex. 2, p l53-54.\n\nSecond, if Dr. Dietz’s reliance on the Engle and O’Donohue article weren’t enough\n(which it is), Dr. Dietz will testify as well based on his extensive clinical experience. In his oun\npractice, he has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false allegations identified by\nEngle & O’Donohue. Dr. Dietz thus could reliably offer these opinions even if the absence of the\narticle. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nThis is at least the third atempt by the government to admit an unreliable exhibit of\nunknoun origin. The problems are manifold, as this Court is aware.\n\nWhen the government last sought admission, after the testimony of Juan Alessi, this\nCourt reserved ruling, recognizing that Mr. Alessi had neither authenticated Exhibit 52 nor laid\nthe required <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for its admission under Rule 8o3(6).\n\nRest assured, promised the government, it would fill in the blanks through the testimony\nof Employee-l. But the government no longer plans to call Employee-l as a witness, so it’s left\nwith a record this Court already deemed inadequate to justify admission of the exhibit.\n\nUndeterred, the government nou, for the very first time, points to something else—Ms.\nMaxwell’s April 2ol6 civil deposition. The government claims that Ms. Maxwell’s deposition\ntestimony authenticates Exhibit 52.\n\nThe government is wrong, for at least two obvious reasons. First, the exhibit Ms.\nMaxwell was shoun in her deposition (Deposition Exhibit l3) is not the same thing as Exhibit\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document532 Filed l2/o9/2l Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 8, 2o2l\nPage 2\n52. Deposition Exhibit l3 is a photocopy of some pages of some document. It is not the bound\nvolume the government seeks to admit as Exhibit 52.\n\nSecond, even if Exhibit l3 were the same thing as Exhibit 52, Ms. Maxwell expressly and\nrepeatedly disclaimed any knouledge of what Exhibit l3 was, when it was created, who created\nit, and hou plaintiffs atorneys came to possess it. She surely did not authenticate it or lay a\n<span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for its admission as a business record.\n\nThe government’s last-ditch effort to admit Exhibit 52 should fail for both reasons, as\nwell as the others this Court already identified and those provided belou.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe government cannot authenticate Exhibit 52 or lay the <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for its admission\nunder Rule 8o3(6).\n\n“To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the\nproponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the\nproponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). When the government atempts to satisfy the\nauthentication requirement by relying on testimony of a person with knouledge, the witness\nmust “testi[fy] that an item is what it is claimed to be.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a)(l).\n\nIn turn, to prove an authenticated document is a business record, Rule 8o3(6) requires the\ngovernment to prove that:\n\n(A) the record was made at or near the time by--or from information transmited\n\nby--someone with knouledge;\n\n(B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business,\n\norganization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit;\n\n(C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8266\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document532 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government’s atempt to authenticate Exhibit 52 through Ms. Maxwell’s\ntestimony about something else entirely fails.\n\nThe flaws in the government’s argument don’t end with these two problems, though each\nproblem itself is dispositive of the government’s request. The government’s leter focuses\nexclusively on the authentication question. The government does not address the business records\nexception or even atempt to justify the admission of Exhibit 52 despite it being hearsay.\n\nThe government also conveniently ignores all it said before about why Exhibit 52 was\nrelevant and hou it would be admited and used as evidence. The government first said Exhibit\n52 was Ms. Maxwell’s book. That was the entire premise of the government’s November l2\nleter and its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s motion in limine. But no witness has testified that it\nwas Ms. Maxwell’s book, and the government has abandoned that argument.!\n\nThe government next said it would call Employee-l as a witness to authenticate the\nexhibit and lay the <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for its admission and, in turn, to testify that Exhibit 52 belonged to\nMs. Maxwell. But no more. The government’s decision not to call Employee-l confirms what\nMs. Maxwell has been saying all along: Exhibit 52 did not belong to her, and Employee-l was\nnever going to testify that it did.\n\nFinally, it would be exceedingly unfair were the government to admit Exhibit 52 at this\nlate stage in its case, having nou abandoned its earlier arguments for admissibility and relevance.\nAs this Court recognized earlier today, Mr. Alessi is done testifying, and Ms. Maxwell cannot be\n\n' We knou the government has abandoned this argument because it relies on Ms.\nMaxwell’s deposition testimony as the basis for admiting Exhibit 52. But in that testimony, Ms.\nMaxwell unequivocally denied being the ouner of or responsible for Deposition Exhibit l3.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo827o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document532 _ Filed l2/o9/2l Page7of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Discussion\n\nThe Government has laid sufficient <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for admission of Government Exhibit 52\nthrough three sources: (l) the testimony of Juan Alessi, (2) the admission of Government Exhibit\n6o6 (the household manual), and (3) evidence corroborating the fact that the contact book reflects\nthe contact information of multiple people who knew the defendant and Epstein. Taken together,\nthis evidence is more than sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude that the contact book is in\nfact a contact book from the Palm Beach house.\n\nFirst, Alessi personally examined Government Exhibit 52 and recognized it. Tr. at 85o.\nHe said it is the same “type of book,” and appeared to be one of the “directories of Ms. Maxwell\nand Mr. Epstein.” /d. He said it had the “same cover,” had the “same binding,” and had layout\nthat was “exactly as the books” that he recalled. (/d. at 85l). Although the books he saw were\nthicker and had larger font, the “format was the same.” (/d. at 85l-52).\n\nAs to the contents of the book, Alessi testified that he saw “many, many, many, many\nnames” in Government Exhibit 52 that were he recognized from the book he saw when he worked\nfor Epstein. (/d. at 85l). He specifically recognized entries in the list for massage in Palm Beach,\nwhich is copied in Government Exhibit 52-G. (/d.)\n\nAlthough Alessi only worked in the Palm Beach house until the end of 2oo2, he explained\nthat the practice during his twelve years that he worked for Epstein was to print new directories\ntwice a year. Tr. at 864. He also determined that Government Exhibit 52 is a copy of a book from\nsometime after he was employed because his name was not in the book, whereas his contact\ninformation and it was “originally . . . in the information for Palm Beach information of the house.”\nId. at 853.

Tr. at 832; see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(4) (permiting authentication based on the\n“contents” of the item). Alessi recognized Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to Alessi’s <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> rested largely on Alessi’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52.

But authentication does not require evidence about the circumstances of the\ncreation or seizure of a piece of evidence, so long as it can be identified by its distinctive markings\nas what the proponent claims it is. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25. It is well setled that\ndefects in chain of custody go to weight and not admissibility.\n\nSecond, the household manual—dating from 2oo5, the year on Government Exhibit 52—\ndemonstrates that the practice identified by Alessi remained in operation into 2oo5. The manual\nexplains that “[t]elephone directories are to be updated every six months, or as the new telephone\ndirectories are available.” GX 6o6 at 7. And it explained that the directories in fact belong to the\ndefendant and Epstein: a copy of their directories “must be placed to the right of each telephone\n(except for the Guestrooms).” GX 6o6 at 7.\n\nThird, the contents of Government Exhibit 52 have been confirmed by other evidence to\naccurately reflect relationships between the defendant and other individuals. See United States v.\nPrevezon Holdings, Ltd., 3l9 F.R.D. 459, 463 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (permiting authentication under\n' Defense counsel also pointed to the additional markings that may have been added by Rodriguez\nor the FBI. Tr. at 872-73, 875. These markings are non-substantive on any page which the\nGovernment is offering, as explained in a prior brief. (Dkt.

While at FIT, I took advantage of different volunteer opportunities and internships in\nthe fashion industry to provide a <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a\nChristmastime internship at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as\na part-time employee.

Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was\nelectrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,\nof difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of hou we both saw New York as a\nchance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)\nwas Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which ouned Henri Bendel\nat the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have\nto carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later\nthat day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel\nclose by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted\nme to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they\nsexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I returned to my classes at FIT and\ncontinued work at Henri Bendel, but I started to crack.

Biros—all nationally\nrecognized claims-administration experts.* Mr. Feinberg is the nation’s leading expert in\ncrafting effective dispute resolution alternatives, and, with Ms. Biros, they have designed and\n' Ex.

The Critical Importance of Confidentiality to the EVCP and Similar Programs\n\nMs. Feldman’s declaration explains why confidentiality is so critical to programs like the\nEVCP.”’ As she notes, “it can be incredibly difficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such\ndeeply personal, intimate, private information about their experiences and the impact it has had\non their lives,” and many victims “suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in\npositions of authority.”°° The EVCP sought to create an environment where claimants did not\nfeel a need to “censor themselves” about their experiences.*! Creating that environment simply\nwould not be possible without strong assurances of confidentiality. As expressed to Ms.\nFeldman by victims’ atorneys and victims themselves, “many victims were initially reluctant to\nparticipate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express assurance of\nconfidentiality.”*?\n\nAny intrusion on that promise would threaten the <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> of the program. As Ms.\nFeldman explains, “[c]ompromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very\n<span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> and fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims.”*?\nCompelling the EVCP to disclose the information it promised to keep confidential would be\n“anathema to the integrity of this Program and others like it” and “would turn the Program on its\nhead with far-reaching consequences to this victim population and beyond”—meaning for the\nEVCP and the viability of other past, existing, and future litigation-alternative victim\ncompensation programs.*4 Ms. Feldman is unaware of any other instance in which an\n9 See Ex.

With the express assurance of confidentiality, and without the formality of court\nproceedings or fear of exposure and cross examination, victims agreed to participate in the\nProgram, let their guards doun and share exceedingly intimate, private information. Claimants\nrelied upon the express condition and assurances of confidentiality in agreeing to support the\nvery existence of the Program, in deciding to participate in the claims process, and in submiting\ntheir claims and any other information to the EVCP. They were willing to trust this process,\ndespite deep-seated distrust of purported systems of “justice,” because of Program\nconfidentiality.\n\nl3. Compromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>\nand fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims who are already\nloath to disclose such personal information. The idea that the information the victims agreed to\ndisclose to the EVCP solely for purposes of evaluation and potential resolution of the claim\nwould be disclosed to anyone outside the EVCP for any other purpose is anathema to the\nintegrity of this Program and others like it. The Program and Protocol were approved by a court\norder from the Probate Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands and I abided by the terms and guiding\nprinciples of the Protocol in every way and at every step of the process. Failing to abide by any\nterm of the Protocol, much less the keystone condition of confidentiality, is intolerable,\nimpermissible, and would lead to the unraveling of the Program. Allouing any disclosure of any\ndocuments, information and/or communications submited to, maintained by, or exchanged with\nthe EVCP would turn the Program on its head with far-reaching consequences to this victim\npopulation and beyond.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 236 of 247 395\nLBUCmax7\n\nl in '94, '95, and '96.

With Jane where she described a schoolgirl outfit, but\n2o she didn't look at the actual photos that they want to\nal introduce and say those look like the schoolgirl outfits I was\n22 wearing on the day I described.\n23 So, at this point, because I don't think there is a\n24 proper <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for the same reasons as we had with Jane, I\n25 would object to those photos being admited.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool294l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l94 of 26l l355\nLC6VMAX6\n\nl MS.

I'm going to deny\n\n4 the government's motion to preclude here, but with guidance.\n\niy First, as we've discussed and I've made clear, Dr.\n\n6 Loftus is testifying, I understand, as a blind expert, meaning\n7 that she'll provide relevant expert opinion, but not apply it\n\n8 to the facts of the case. And just as Dr. Rocchio offered\n\n9 testimony that included examples of grooming, variety of\n\nlo grooming examples or factors that might make a child vulnerable\nll to sexual abuse, it seems comparable to me that Dr. Loftus can\nl2 offer examples of suggestive activity, including the two\n\nl3 examples the government seeks to exclude. So long as her\n\nl4 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this\nl5 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond\nl6 the bounds of a blind expert.\n\nl7 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided\nl8 an adequate <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for expert opinion on suggestive\n\nl9 questioning by the government by cross-examining witnesses\n2o about the questions they were asked. For example, the defense\n2l on cross-examination of Jane asked about the government asking\n22 her the same question three times in the same interview, trial\n23 transcript at 5l5.

And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials,\nbecause they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous. The same\ncould be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in\nsupport of charges that later proceeded to trial.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015213.jpg": "Pi Mu Epsilon, National Mathematics Honorary, elected l965\n\nMortar Board, National Senior Women’s Honorary, elected l965\n\nElected, Golden Key International Honour Society, honorary member, 2oo5\n\nFellouships\n\nOffice of Education Traineeship, Stanford University, l966-69\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health Fellouship, Stanford University, l969-7o\n\nAmerican Council on Education Fellouship in Academic Administration, Harvard University, l975-76\n\nFellou, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, l978-79\n\nGrants, Contracts, Research Funding\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, l97l-72; l972-73; l976-79 (Human Memory)\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation, l974-76 (Human Memory)\n\nGeneral Services Administration, l974-75 (Communications--w/Keating)\n\nNational Bureau of Standards, l976-77; l98o-82 (Communications--w/Keating)\n\nNational Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, l978-85 (Human Memory)\n\nNational Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, l98o-83 (Jury Behavior--w/Severance)\n\nNational Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, l983-85; (Hypnosis--w/Greene)\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, l984-86; l986-89;l989-92 (Memory)\n\nNational Center for Health Services Research, l986-88 (Survey Memory)\n\nNational Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, l986-88; l988-9l (Jury Comprehension--w/Greene-Goodman)\n\nFund for Research on Dispute Resolution, l989-9l (Predictions of Success--w/Goodman)\n\nNational Institute of Health, l99l-95 (Cognition & Health--w/Croyle)\n\nNational Institute of Health, l993-94 (Health/sex memory: subcontract from UCSF/Catania)\n\nLeverhulme Trust, Postevent info and erasing memories, l997-l999 (w/ Dan Wright, Univ. of Bristol)\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh, Travel Grant, 2oo6\n\nGrawemeyer Award Funding given to UCI, 2oo5-present.\n\nNewkirk Center for Science & Society, 2ol7-2ol9.\n\nAwards & Honors\n\nNational Lecturer of Sigma Xi, l978-8o\n\nAmerican Psychological Association nomination for the NSF Waterman Award for Outstanding\nContributions to Science, l977 and l978\n\nNational Media Award for Eyewitness Testimony (American Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, Distinguished\nContribution, l98o)\n\nGreyhound Research Award, l987-88\n\nHonorary Fellou, British Psychological Society, l99l (includes lifetime membership)\n\nGeorge E.

The government argues that the above two opinions,\n3 houever, lack a <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> in the record. I'm going to deny\n\n4 the government's motion to preclude here, but with guidance.\n\niy First, as we've discussed and I've made clear, Dr.\n\n6 Loftus is testifying, I understand, as a blind expert, meaning\n7 that she'll provide relevant expert opinion, but not apply it\n\n8 to the facts of the case. And just as Dr. Rocchio offered\n\n9 testimony that included examples of grooming, variety of\n\nlo grooming examples or factors that might make a child vulnerable\nll to sexual abuse, it seems comparable to me that Dr. Loftus can\nl2 offer examples of suggestive activity, including the two\n\nl3 examples the government seeks to exclude. So long as her\n\nl4 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this\nl5 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond\nl6 the bounds of a blind expert.\n\nl7 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided\nl8 an adequate <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for expert opinion on suggestive\n\nl9 questioning by the government by cross-examining witnesses\n2o about the questions they were asked. For example, the defense\n2l on cross-examination of Jane asked about the government asking\n22 her the same question three times in the same interview, trial\n23 transcript at 5l5.

It's extraordinarily broad.

With Jane where she described a schoolgirl outfit, but\n2o she didn't look at the actual photos that they want to\nal introduce and say those look like the schoolgirl outfits I was\n22 wearing on the day I described.\n23 So, at this point, because I don't think there is a\n24 proper <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> for the same reasons as we had with Jane, I\n25 would object to those photos being admited.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8527\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018531.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l94 of 26l l355\nLC6VMAX6\n\nl MS.

Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor.

Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts.

Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that ... l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nia According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021315.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAT 3536o38, Pagel43 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.’ Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!** Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\niss The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\n\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021316.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel44 of 258\nSA-l42\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\n\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates .. . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021317.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l43 3536o38, Pagel45 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff?s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “‘as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!®° At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram. Florida Statute § 948.ool(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the\ncommunity.”\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021838.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Pagel4 of 5l\n\nadding, “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for\nthe district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd.

One circuit said it was “unable to discern\na sound basis for the [Annabi] rule,” adding that the decision “really has no\nanalytically sound <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span>.” U.S. v.

But, as Gebbie\nexplained, Annabi misread this Court’s precedent and fashioned an “illogical” rule\nout of whole cloth:\n\nThe first case cited in Annabi is Abbamonte, but Abbamonte merely\n\nrelies upon the other two cases cited in Annabi—Alessi and Papa ...\n\nThe court in Alessi relies upon Papa, which is a related case. ...\n\nPapa, houever, provides no support for the rule the Second Circuit\n\nfollous. ...

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application.

In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023153.tif": "for up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*?

She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.'*? Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!®4 Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023154.tif": "Florida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail. ...\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023155.tif": "the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

A man always quick to help\nsomeone who is doun, or to offer an opportunity to someone to pursue a\ndream or a goal.\n\nGenerosity to Educational. Wellness, Civic and Scientific Organizations. Jeffrey\nhas been extraordinarily generous to a host of educational, wellness, civic, and scientific\norganizations. Between 2ooo and 2oo6 he donated personally, through his business and\ninterests, and through foundations be had established,” a total exceeding $l6,ooo,ooo.\nThe good generated by his largesse is suggested in the follouing examples.\n\nJeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps\nnone more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\ncommunity at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n° At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,\nbut in essence this is what happened.\n\nJeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly\ndid not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also\nparticipate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had\ndecided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on\n. the building because I had been associated with the institution for such a\n‘ long time. I fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion\nand greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor\nbut without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no\nbuilding. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no °\nnew building and that would have been an enormous loss to the\ncommunity.\n, The building that nou stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-\nRadcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a\nnoteworthy aspect of Jeffrey’s giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his\n?

Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the .\nspotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.\nJeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the\nInstitute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe\nhaven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such\nplaces as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors\nover the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the\nStockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were\nthe original sponsors and creators of “The Prize for Promise,” a national award program\ndesigned to “identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,\ncourage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of\nendeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s\ngenerosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former\nPresident Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the\n: room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate\ndegree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton\n, <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New\nYork where they are expected to graduate in 2oo8.\nJeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness\norganizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer\nResearch Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, the\nContinuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and\nthe Center for Health and Healing.\nJeffrey has also been a Jong time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in\nboth New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a\nmajor contributor to the Robin Hood <span class=\"highlight\">Foundation</span>, whose purpose is to target poverty in\nNew York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty\n: fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money\nto literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational,\n. sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children’s advocacy and\nwomen’s groups. One noteworthy example is the Antilles School in St. Thomas which\n9\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033230.tif": "in 2oo5 recognized Jeffrey’s generosity in assisting 27 students from 24 families to atend\nthe school who otherwise would not have been able to.\n\nPerhaps the most unique area of Jeffrey’s philanthropy is his no-strings atached\nsupport of scientists and mathematicians who are conducting “bleeding edge” research.\nAs previously noted, Jeffrey has always had a deep interest in mathematics and science,\nand is particularly atracted to research which focuses on the mathematical <span class=\"highlight\">foundation</span> of\nlife. By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from l998 until 2oo3. In\n2oo3, Jeffrey donated $6,5oo,ooo to Harvard University, where I work as\nDirector of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of\nMathematics and Biology. Both donations were meant to support my\nbasic research work without any strings atached.\nlo\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323o\n"};
