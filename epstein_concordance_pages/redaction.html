Berman\nCase No: l9 CR 49o (RMB)\nPage 2\n\ne The right to be reasonably protected from the accused (§ 377 l(a)(l));\n\ne The right to be heard at any public proceeding involving release, parole, or sentencing (§\n\n377 l(a)(3));\n\ne The right to confer with the atorney for the Government (§ 377 l(a)(5)); and,\n\ne The right to be treated with fairness and respect for dignity and privacy (§ 377 l(a)(8)).\nSee also Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d loll, lol6-l7 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (fairness and dignity are\nsubstantive, enforceable rights); Jn re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l, 394-95 (5th Cir. 2oo8) (government must\nconfer with victims before making consequential case decisions); Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d l244 (llth\nCir. 2o2l) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully atached post-conviction).\nGiven our history fighting for the enforcement of the CVRA on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein’s many\nvictims, we were quite surprised to learn that the government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a step required\nby the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000782.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document l-2, o7/23/2ol9, 26l4667, Page6 of 7\nComey present;Also present is FBI Special Agent Amanda Young and NYPD\nDetective Paul Byrne present;Defendant present with atorneys Martin Weinberg, Reid\nWeingarten, Marc Fernich, James Brochin; and Joseph Jaffe; USPO Pretrial Services\nOfficers Francesca Tessier—Miller, Bernisa Mejia and Dennis Khilkevich present; Also\npresent Court Reporter Kelly Surina present; supplemental submission(s) to be filed by\n7/l6/l9 5:oo pm; ruling on bail hearing scheduled for 7/l8/l9 at 9:3o am.

Nathan from\nAUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2o2o\nre: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

STERNHEIAA\n\nThe Court’s request for updates concerning Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\ndoes litle to improve her situation. Quite the contrary. The government’s update leters are\nanything but helpful: They fuel media atention which resounds to Ms. Maxwell’s detriment. The\ngovernment’s atempt to publicly embarrass and humiliate Ms. Maxwell in the hostile court of\npublic opinion further erodes the likelihood that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\nThe government’s review of the MDC may be Yelp-worthy, but it does not justify Ms.\nMaxwell’s inappropriate detention. If the government wants to compare Ms. Maxwell to other\ndefendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail.\n\nIt is debatable whether the public has a “right to knou” about Ms. Maxwell’s conditions\nof confinement, but clearly, it does not extend to personal and medical information. The\ngovernment safeguards personal information regarding its witnesses and is reluctant to release\nany unless mandated by statute or court order. Yet the government fails to accord Ms. Maxwell\nthe same treatment.\n\nShould the Court request further updates from the government, we request that they be\nlimited to changed circumstances and filed under seal or subject to appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 77 Filed l2/ol/2o Page l of l\nUSDC SDNY t”™”\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/l/2o |]\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Government has reviewed the proposed redactions to the defense leters\ndated November 25, 2o2o and November 3o, 2o2o. Because those proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of third parties, the Government has no objection\nto the defense’s proposed redactions. The Government objects, houever, to the defense request\nfor a sealed in camera hearing to discuss further sealing requests from the defense. As\ndemonstrated by the defense’s recent leters, any request for sealing of third party information can\nbe made in writing with narrouly tailored redactions. Based on defense counsel’s proffers\nregarding the potential harms that may come from publicly identifying proposed cosigners, the\nGovernment has no objection to the <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> and sealed filing of any identifying information for\nthose individuals. Given the availability of redacted filings, the Government sees no reason for an\nentire hearing to be conducted without the opportunity for the public or the victims in this case to\nobserve. Indeed, given that crime victims have a statutory right to be present and heard at any\nproceeding regarding the defendant’s “release,” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), the Government would\nobject to any proceeding addressing aspects of a renewed bail application that was conducted\nentirely in camera.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nBy: __s/\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool846", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001852.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 86 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

R. Crim. P. 49.l(d) provides that “a court may order that a filing be made under seal\nwithout <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing\nto file a redacted version for the public record.” While the Second Circuit has recognized a\npresumption of access under both common law and the First Amendment, it is appropriate to\npermit the filing of documents under seal if “countervailing factors” in the common law\nframework or “higher values” in the First Amendment framework so demand.

The reference in this sentence to\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that\nthere is some minimal public interest in knouing the identity of a particular surety, it is vastly\noutweighed by the significant privacy concerms in this case.

[C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not\nenough. This case has generated so much media atention and public opprobrium that public\nie.\n\n* Given the sensitive subject mater of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly\nidentified. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her\nalleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. As we have all been recently reminded with the tragic case of the\ndeath of Judge Esther Salas’s son, there are people who are capable of commiting horrible acts of violence—even\nagainst innocent third parties—by convincing themselves that their actions are justified.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool856", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

We\nare merely seeking the ability to file a renewed bail application for Ms. Maxwell without further\nrisking the safety and privacy of sureties needed to support that application. This is the first of\nseveral confidentiality issues that will arise in connection with the Motion, and the sureties will\nbe looking at the Court’s ruling as an indication of the level of confidentiality they can expect to\nbe afforded.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its omnibus memorandum of law opposing\nDefendants’ twelve pre-trial motions. It filed the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits,\nunder temporary seal pending the Court’s resolution of its request to redact sensitive or\nconfidential information. See Dkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to\ncertain of the redactions that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional\nredactions. Having considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the\nGovernment’s requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant’s additional\n<span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> requests, with the exceptions discussed belou.\n\nTo begin with, the Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under\nthis test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial\ndocuments;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials;\nand (i) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o.\n“Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd. at\nl2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (““Amodeo I?’)).\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2762", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002763.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 2 of 5\n\nThe proposed redactions mostly satisfy this test. First, the Government’s brief in\nopposition to the Defendant’s pre-trial motions is a “judicial document” for purposes of the first\nelement of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir.\nl995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First Amendment\npresumption of access. /d. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). The question, then, is whether the <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> and sealing requests are narrouly tailored to\nserve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access.\n\nLike the Government’s previous <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> and sealing requests in this case, the\nGovernment bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are necessary to\nprotect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties’ personal\nprivacy interests. As a general mater, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for\novercoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d\n46o, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the\nGovernment’s brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit l contains a single <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>—the\nname of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual’s personal privacy interests\noutweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The\nproposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only\nthe names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety\nand privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that ataches to those\ndocuments.\n\nThe Court overrules the Defendant’s objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5\nof the Government’s brief and adopts the Government’s proposed redactions. The core of the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2763", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002764.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 3of5\nDefendant’s objections relate to her contention that some of the information contained in the\nredactions has been made public by other means. Notwithstanding this, the redactions to which\nthe Defendant objects relate to the privacy interests of third parties, which the Second Circuit has\nadmonished “should weigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo IP’), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995). At least some of the redactions to which the\nDefendant objects relate to private “family affairs” of a third party, a factor that “weigh[s] more\nheavily against access than conduct affecting a substantial portion of the public.” Jd. at lo5l.\nAnd though the Defendant contends that some of the information contained in the redactions is\npublic, she furnishes no evidence to that effect. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nsignificant privacy interests at stake justify the limited and narrouly tailored redactions\ncontained in Exhibit 5.\n\nIn addition, the Court adopts the Defendant’s proposed additional redactions to pages\nl29-l34 of the Government’s brief. Those portions of the transcript, which were redacted in the\ncivil mater, concern privacy interests and their disclosure would merely serve to cater to a\n“craving for that which is sensational and impure.” Amodeo II, 7l F.3d at lo5l (citation\nomited). The Court thus concludes that such redactions are justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the redactions\ncontained in pages l-l28 of the Government’s brief. To provide some context, the redacted\nportions of the brief relate to sealed proceedings that took place before different judges relating\nto the issuance of grand jury subpoenas in connection with the present case. See Dkt. No. 5l.\nBecause the Government’s brief is a judicial document and because the presumption of access\nataches, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> requests must be “necessary to preserve higher values and\nonly if the sealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2764", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002765.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 4of5\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Courts have noted that “disclosing the details of\nthe Government’s efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation, as the\nindividuals and entities under investigation would be put on notice.” United States v. Madoff,\n626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9). And the Government’s interest in protecting an\nongoing investigation from the “danger of impairing law enforcement” may be a countervailing\nfactor that outweighs the presumption of access. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. But the\nGovernment advances no non-conclusory basis as to why its investigation at this stage of the\nmater would be imperiled by the disclosure of the information regarding hou it obtained the\ninformation in question, and the requested redactions are far from narrouly tailored. As a result,\nthe Court denies the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> requests in pages l-l28 and denies its request to\nfile Exhibits 8 and 9 under seal, since those documents relate to this very issue and the same\nreasoning applies to them. The Court will give the Government an opportunity to seek more\ntailored redactions if it wishes and to specifically justify the ongoing need to redact the requested\ninformation and documents. By March 22, 2o2l, the Government may file a leter with the\nCourt—under seal, if necessary—justifying the specific <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> and sealing requests.\nAlternatively, by that date the Government can indicate that it will not seek to renew the request.\n\nFurthermore, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the redactions\ncontained in pages l87-l88 of the Government’s brief. While the Court previously had granted\nthe request to redact the same information, see Dkt.

Alison J. Nathan\nApril l, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nThe testimony at issue is undeniably private: it relates exclusively to Ms. Maxwell’s\nconsensual adult sexual activities involving “‘sex toys or devices used in sexual activities” and\na “three-way sexual” encounter involving an adult “blond and brunete.” See Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558, 567 (U.S. 2oo3) (“It suffices for us to acknouledge that adults may\nchoose to enter upon [a] relationship in the confines of their homes and their oun private lives\nand still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate\nconduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is\nmore enduring.”); see also Griswold v. Connecticut, 38l U.S. 479, 485-86 (U.S. l965). And\nMs. Maxwell proposes only those redactions “narrouly tailored” to preserve her privacy\ninterest in her intimate, consensual adult sexual activities. Press-Enterprise IT, lo6 S.Ct. at\n2743. Rather than seek to redact either the argument or the surrounding testimony, Ms.\nMaxwell marked for <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> those limited portions of the deposition transcript that Judge\nPreska ordered sealed. The remaining unredacted portions generally describe the redacted\ntestimony such that the public and media will have no issue ascertaining the nature of the\nlegal issues nor fulfill their role in monitoring the Courts. Inclusion of the exact lines\nreferencing “three-way sexual activity” or “sex toys” does not add to the argument but\nredacting those lines does preserve Ms. Maxwell’s privacy in testimony that was both\ncompelled and obtained under highly improper methods.\n\nIn addition to her privacy interests, Ms. Maxwell seeks to preserve her right to a fair\ntrial free from unfair pretrial publicity concerning what may ultimately be deemed\n“inadmissible” evidence at the criminal trial. United States v. Doe, 63 F.3d l2l, l28 (2d Cir.\nl995) (“compelling interests” that counterbalance any presumption of access include the\n“privacy interests of the defendant” and the fair trial rights of the defendant).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3849", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l7 Filed o4/l9/2l Page5of6\nThe Hon.

Indeed, this Court rejected Ms. Maxwell’s argument that certain portions of\nthe Response and its exhibits should be unredacted because the material had already been\nmade public. See Dkt.

Menninger dated March 9,\n2o2l (Objection to Proposed Redactions of Government’s Omnibus Response & Exhibit 5) at\n2-3 (Virginia Giuffre memoir detailing her private family maters released by Second Circuit\nin The Billionaire Playboys Club manuscript). The government also persists in using\npseudonyms in this case such as “Minor Victim 2” in place of an accuser who has told her\nstory most publicly on Netflix, ABC News, and the New York Times. Ms. Maxwell’s privacy\nrights to her zealously guarded intimate sexual affairs deserve at least as much protection as\nthird-parties who have chosen at every turn to publicize their salacious allegations.\n\nMs. Maxwell respectfully requests that the redactions to pages l29-l34 that she\npreviously proposed in her March 9, 2o2l Leter at Exhibit 3 be adopted, in addition to the\ngovernment’s redactions to those same pages.

The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making the Baseless Argument\nthat the Defendant Was a Victim of Jeffrey Epstein\nIn order for counsel to ask questions or make argument about a fact, counsel must have a\ngood faith basis for advancing that fact.

The Government’s years-long investigation has\nnot developed any evidence that the defendant was victimized in any way by Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Government has also met with the defense many times, both prior to presenting this case to a\ngrand jury and when conferring during the pendency of this mater. During one of those\nmeetings, defense counsel made a variety of factual assertions in order to dissuade the\nGovernment from charging the defendant. At no time has the defense represented to the\nGovernment that Epstein victimized the defendant in any manner.

And as to trial\nexhibits, see for example Judge Jed S. Rakoff's order in US v. Weigand, 2o-cr-l88\n(JSR) htps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2o536946-rakofforderonmrlicp\nThere, Judge Rakoff ordered the US Atorney's Office to make trial exhibit\navailable to the public at large.

It cannot be refused in this case.\nAlso, Inner City Press understands that the listen-only call-in telephone lines\navailable so far in the case, there may be an atempt to discontinue them. The Court\nshould take judicial notice of continue COVID-l9 issues, including people's\nunderstandable concerns about congregating even in so-called overflou rooms.

The Court has also received requests\nfrom media organizations to unseal the motion. The Court is aware there is substantial public\ninterest in this mater and will ensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully\nsafeguarded. At the same time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in\nconsidering these sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant’s and\nthe Government’s, interest.\n\nAccordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing should\nthemselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in\nsuch a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> in the first\ninstance.\n\nThe Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three-part test in\nLugosch v.

Nathan\nFebruary l, 2o22\nPage 4\nTo determine whether sealing a document is appropriate, the Court must engage in a multi-\nstep process. First, the Court must determine whether the document is a “judicial document” to\nwhich a presumption of access would atach. Silver, 2ol6 WL l572993, at *3 (citing Newsday\nLLC v. Cty. of Nassau, 73o F.3d l56, l66, l67 n.l5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)). If it is a “judicial document,”\nthe Court must next determine whether the common law right of access or the ““more robust”\nFirst Amendment right of access applies. /d. (citing Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o). Ifthe document is\nsubject to the common law right of access, the Court must “determine the weight of the\npresumption and measure it against competing considerations.” /d. (citing United States v. Erie\nCty. N.Y., 763 F.3d 235, 24l (2d Cir. 2ol4)); accord Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o. If the\ndocument is subject to the more stringent First Amendment right of access, the Court must\ndetermine “by specific, on the-record-findings whether higher values necessitate a narrouly\ntailored sealing.” Jd. (cleaned up); accord Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24. In either case, the Court\nmust also determine whether <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> is “a viable remedy,” or whether the document presents “an\nall or nothing mater.” /d. (quoting Amodeo IJ, 7l F.3d at lo53).\nDiscussion\nMs. Maxwell does not dispute that the Motion is a “judicial document” that is subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and the common law. See United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l7 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citing United States v. Gerena, 869\nF.2d 82, 85 (2d Cir. l989) (right of access under the First Amendment extends to briefs and\nmemoranda filed in connection with post-trial motions in criminal cases)); id. at 5l8 (presumption\n2o873o6.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8855", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594_ Filed o2/o4/22 Page4of5\nPage 4\nobviously will be reading the Defense Motion prior to any hearing. The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\npre-trial, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing. The Defense\nMotion is not exceptional.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8896", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008903.jpg": "CaGade2N2o-o888GA2AEJN DdoourenbSso Filed o2/o8/22 PRggd@b!ll\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nFebruary l, 2o22\n\nPage 4\n\nTo determine whether sealing a document is appropriate, the Court must engage in a multi-\nstep process. First, the Court must determine whether the document is a “judicial document” to\nwhich a presumption of access would atach. Silver, 2ol6 WL l572993, at *3 (citing Newsday\nLLC v. Cty. of Nassau, 73o F.3d l56, l66, l67 n.l5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)). If it is a “judicial document,”\nthe Court must next determine whether the common law right of access or the ““more robust”\nFirst Amendment right of access applies. /d. (citing Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o). Ifthe document is\nsubject to the common law right of access, the Court must “determine the weight of the\npresumption and measure it against competing considerations.” /d. (citing United States v. Erie\nCty. N.Y., 763 F.3d 235, 24l (2d Cir. 2ol4)); accord Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o. If the\ndocument is subject to the more stringent First Amendment right of access, the Court must\ndetermine “by specific, on the-record-findings whether higher values necessitate a narrouly\ntailored sealing.” Jd. (cleaned up); accord Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24. In either case, the Court\nmust also determine whether <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> is “a viable remedy,” or whether the document presents “an\nall or nothing mater.” /d. (quoting Amodeo IJ, 7l F.3d at lo53).\nDiscussion\nMs. Maxwell does not dispute that the Motion is a “judicial document” that is subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and the common law. See United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l7 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citing United States v. Gerena, 869\nF.2d 82, 85 (2d Cir. l989) (right of access under the First Amendment extends to briefs and\nmemoranda filed in connection with post-trial motions in criminal cases)); id. at 5l8 (presumption\n2o873o6.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008911.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page3of7\nplace” and, more specifically, to “ensure that the most critical evidence to be elicited at the\nhearing—namely, the testimony of Juror 5o—is not tainted by outside information and\ninfluence.” Dkt. No. 59o at 2. The Court agrees that the integrity of any inquiry is a “higher\nvalue” that must be weighed in determining public access to the documents. As the Court has\npreviously articulated, it must “ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going\nforward, should one be ordered,” as “[t]hat too is in the public, as well as the Defendant’s and\nthe Government’s, interest.” Dkt. No. 585.\n\nBut restricting public access to judicial documents, whether through sealing or <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>,\nmust be “narrouly tailored to serve that interest.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. Wholesale sealing\nof the motion papers, even on a temporary basis, is not narrouly tailored to serve the interest in\nensuring the integrity of any potential inquiry. The Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s\nconcern that media interest in the motion warrants temporary sealing of the documents in their\nentirety. Defendant argues that “there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a\nfair trial will be prejudiced by publicity” because coverage “will influence the memories of other\npotential witnesses,” as well as Juror 5o. Dkt. No. 59o at 3-5 (relying on United States v. Silver,\nNo. l5 Cr. 93 (VEC), 2ol6 WL l572993, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l4, 2ol6)). As the Government\nproperly notes, houever, the concern in the pretrial posture, as in Si/ver, is that potential jurors\nmay learn prejudicial information they would otherwise not. Here, houever, the concern is\nentirely absent for at least two reasons. First, much of the information relied upon in the\nDefendant’s motion and the Government’s response is publicly available. And second, the Court\nis the relevant fact-finder with respect to any potential hearing and it is obviously privy to the\ninformation whether filed under seal or filed publicly.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page4of7\n\nAccordingly, the Defendant’s motion to keep the papers under seal in their entirety is\ndenied. Instead, the parties must propose narrouly tailored redactions as necessary to serve\nimportant interests. Here those interests are to ensure the integrity of any inquiry going forward\nand to protect juror anonymity and privacy. Those interests justify <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of the questions the\nparties propose be asked at any hearing. See United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt.

And they may justify <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of any specific factual information developed by the\nparties that has not been publicly reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired\nabout at any forthcoming hearing. The Court will also permit redactions necessary to ensure\njuror anonymity and privacy. See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464\nU.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). By contrast, there is no basis to redact legal arguments, case citations,\nand analysis regarding the standard by which the parties contend that the Defendant’s motion\nshould be evaluated, as well as legal arguments, case citations, and analysis regarding the proper\nscope of any potential hearing. Nor will the Court permit the <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of information that is\nwidely reported in the press. Such redactions do not conform with the dictates of Lugosch and\nare not necessary to protect the integrity of any inquiry.\n\nImportantly, follouing the Court’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if\none is ordered, all redactions will be promptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any\ncontinuing interest in juror anonymity and privacy.\n\nThe parties are thus ORDERED to propose narrouly tailored redactions to the Defense\nmotion, the Government’s response in opposition, and the Defense reply, as consistent with this\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o7 Filed o2/24/22 Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT sinmbenceaieat ,\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK Zeneca\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #;\nDATE FILED: 2/24/22\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell write to inform the Court that we do not request sealing or\n<span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of the leter submited by Robert Y. Lewis, Esq., counsel to Sarah Ransome and\nElizabeth Stein. Houever, Mr. Lewis’s leter raises an issue that we believe the Court must\nresolve prior to the sentencing hearing; namely, who may submit victim impact statements to the\nCourt or address the Court at sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”).\n\nUnder the CVRA, a “crime victim” has, among other things, “the right to be reasonably\nheard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any\nparole proceeding.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense\nin the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The concept of\n“direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only covers victims of\nthe conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly, No. 3:ll-cr-l2l\n(AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he determination as to whether\nperson has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is made with reference to the\nconduct underlying the charged offense.) (emphasis added).\n\nThe conduct underlying the offenses charged against Ms. Maxwell ended “in or about\n2oo4.” To our understanding, Ms. Ransome alleges that she was a victim of Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell from approximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in\nthis case ended. She therefore does not qualify as a “crime victim” under the CVRA. We do not\nknou when Ms. Stein alleges that she was a victim, but she would also not qualify as a “crime\nvictim” if the conduct she alleges post-dates 2oo4 or she was not a minor. According to\nuncorroborated press reports Ms. Stein claims to have met Maxwell in l994 when Ms. Stein was\n2l years old and not a minor.\n\nIn his leter to the Court, dated June l4, 2o22. Mr. Lewis requests that Ms. Ransome and\nMs. Stein be given an opportunity to speak at Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding and\nreferences that Ms. Ransome spoke at the hearing conducted by Judge Berman follouing\nEpstein’s death. But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the\nhearing conducted by Judge Berman. Follouing Epstein’s death, the government moved for a\nnolle prosequi to dispose of the case pursuant to Second Circuit law holding that if a defendant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo53o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67l Filed o6/24/22 Pagelofl\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT Bane Sane \\|\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK aesteaneesnoine!\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #;\nDATE FILED: 6/24/22\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

See l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4).\n\nWith respect to all other victim impact statements, which were not solicited by the\nGovernment, the Government is not asking the Court to make any factual findings about these\nindividuals at sentencing or to consider these statements when weighing the factors under l8\nU.S.C. § 3553(a). Houever, in light of the Court’s “largely unlimited” discretion “as to the kind\nof information it may consider, or the source from which it may come,” United States v. Eberhard,\n525 F.3d l75, l77 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (cleaned up), the Court may accept these statements as part of\nthe record at sentencing. The Government defers to the Court as to whether and in what form it\nwishes to accept statements from these individuals.\n\nFinally, the Government opposes the <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of any victim impact statements. The\ndefendant has not justified her <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> requests under the three-part test articulated in Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). To the extent there is a privacy interest\nat stake in these documents, it belongs to the victims, who are not seeking to file these leters under\nseal.

Engelmayer\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\n) Page 3\n\nsome, the Maxwell conviction is the only meaningful measure of criminal accountability;\n\nits erosion would be devastating.’\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pageloof 3l\nre Craig; to disclose whether it had given notice of its motion to Maxwell’s victims; and to file\nunder seal the grand jury transcripts (unredacted and as redacted for proposed public release) and\nother grand jury materials, including exhibits. /d. at 3.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019707.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagel4 of l9\ntemporarily sealed while the Court resolves the <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> request.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions.

If no such Notice is filed, the transcript\nmay be made remotely electronically available to the public without <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> after 9o\ncalendar days.... (McGuirk, Kelly) (Entered: l2/lo/2o2o)\n\nl2/l4/2o2o 95 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

The government’s update leters are\nanything but helpful: They fuel media atention which resounds to Ms. Maxwell’s detriment. The\ngovernment’s atempt to publicly embarrass and humiliate Ms. Maxwell in the hostile court of\npublic opinion further erodes the likelihood that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\nThe government’s review of the MDC may be Yelp-worthy, but it does not justify Ms.\nMaxwell’s inappropriate detention.

The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See\nDkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some\ndelay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure. Houever, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8\nweeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,\nwhich are not voluminous, to the defense by March l2, 2o2l. Disclosure of the\nmaterials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see\nDkt. No. 36.

On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou.

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Government has moved for an order requiring\nDavid Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l follouing an op-ed that he\nauthored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 3o9. Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that \"presumptively involve a substantial\nlikelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.\" S.D.N.Y.\nLocal Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated\nwith the pending case are nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the\npurview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to\nMr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and\ncounsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair\ntrial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters\nheading touard trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those\nassociated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they\nrisk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of\nthe upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h). In addition to the\nimpact it could have on this mater, failure to comply could also result in atorney\ndiscipline. Id. Rule 23.l(4).

As a post-trial housekeeping mater, Court staff\ndirected the parties via email to complete the process of providing copies of Court\nExhibits with narrouly tailored redactions (e.g., redactions to protect the anonymity of\njurors and of witnesses the Court permited to testify under pseudonyms) for the Court\nto docket. The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the\nDefense indicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted. The\nGovernment is accordingly ORDERED to docket a leter on ECF on or before January\n28, 2o22, indicating why a <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> is no longer being sought for the name of this\nwitness. Once the Government confirms in that leter that it no longer seeks <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>\nof the name, then the Defense may file the temporarily sealed leter on the docket\nwithout <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of the name.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020471.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page85 of 9l\nquestions are narrouly tailored to further the interest of protecting juror anonymity.\nThe Court will file the unredacted documents under seal.

It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span>\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions\nto Exhibit ll of the Government's submission by March 22, 2o2l (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena.

Houever, for the reasons stated in the Court's March\n29, 2o2l Order, the information is already part of the public record in this case and\naccordingly the proposed redactions are unnecessary and overbroad.

The\nmere existence of a confidentiality agreement or a protective order covering judicial\ndocuments is insufficient to overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi Nissay\nDoua Ins. Co. v.

The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine whether the Government knouingly misrepresented facts to procure an\norder modifying the protective order.

This conclusion is guided\nby the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the specific arguments the\nGovernment has put forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy\ninterests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.\nSee United States v.

Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and that\nthe First Amendment and common law presumptions of access atach. But in balancing\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the\nspecific arguments the Government has put forward in this leter, including the need to\nprotect the privacy interests of third parties referenced in the documents, favor the\nnarrouly tailored redactions.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted\nin part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to\ncertain questions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to\nensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No.\n255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over\ncopies of video tapes of the in-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video\ntapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels preservation leter. Dkt. No. 248,\nEx. C.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Government has moved for an order requiring\nDavid Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l follouing an op-ed that he\nauthored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 3o9. Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that \"presumptively involve a substantial\nlikelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.\" S.D.N.Y.\nLocal Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated\nwith the pending case are nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the\npurview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to\nMr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and\ncounsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair\ntrial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters\nheading touard trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those\nassociated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they\nrisk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of\nthe upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h). In addition to the\nimpact it could have on this mater, failure to comply could also result in atorney\ndiscipline. Id. Rule 23.l(4).

(Comey,\nMaurene) (Entered: ll/l2/2o2l)\n\nll/l2/2o2l | 458 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nmotion seeking clarification on two items from the November l, 2o2l pretrial\nconference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed\norder regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November l8,\n2o2l. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

As a post-trial housekeeping mater, Court staff\ndirected the parties via email to complete the process of providing copies of Court\nExhibits with narrouly tailored redactions (e.g., redactions to protect the anonymity of\njurors and of witnesses the Court permited to testify under pseudonyms) for the Court\nto docket. The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the\nDefense indicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted. The\nGovernment is accordingly ORDERED to docket a leter on ECF on or before January\n28, 2o22, indicating why a <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> is no longer being sought for the name of this\nwitness.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v.

The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

See Dkt. Nos. 6o5, 6o6. The Court\nhas reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with\nits prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 6o5. The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify <span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs,\naccompanying exhibits, and their January l3 leters, by February 25, 2o22. The Court\nwill docket Juror 5o's motion. As noted in its prior Order, follouing the Court's\nresolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly\nunsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020572.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page86 of 92\nquestions are narrouly tailored to further the interest of protecting juror anonymity.\nThe Court will file the unredacted documents under seal.

No. 89. The Government did not file\nany opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After due consideration, the Court\nwill adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The Court's decision to adopt those\nredactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must:\n(l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the\nweight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (ll) balance\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure.” Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d\nCir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that\nDefendant's leter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and\nuseful in the judicial process,' thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of\nthe first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d\nl4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches. Id. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted.\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non-party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for his\nclient in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on behalf\nof the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the leter, the Court\nforwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to counsel, which it\nhas done.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers categorically deny\nthe allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff based on the incident\nand the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no views as to whether some\nother action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either sides allegations. This\nCourts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an\nopportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-client\ncommunications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to\ntake further action at this time. After recetving the defenses first leter motion, the Court\nordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why the Court should not grant the requested\nrelief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in part defense counsels original request and\nordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain questions about the April 24, 2o2l\nincident and the procedures in place to ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells\nlawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense counsels current application is that\nthis Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of the in-person atorney-client\nvisit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels\npreservation leter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to\nview or receive copies of those materials as a mater of law, they should be provided. To\nthe extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that\napplication is denied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell has the opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in\nlight of all relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained\ninmates in BOP custody.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of her\nrights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nand to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government\ndid not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a\nprotective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES\nMaxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the Defense\nindicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No.\n58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\n<span class=\"highlight\">redaction</span> in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\nreference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification\nleter on or before February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new\ntrial motion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this\ncase, the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense\nthe opportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in support,\nwhich is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are proposed, the\nDefense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22, and the\nGovernment leter would be due February l8, 2o22.
