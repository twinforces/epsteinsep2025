The investigation was\nprompted by a series of articles published by the Miami Herald earlier that same week relating to\nEpstein, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior conviction.

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafaia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 348\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

If you\nwant to work major cases in the district you must understand and\naccept the fact that there is a chain of command — something you\ndisregard with great regularity.\n\nVillafafia acknouledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to\ndeviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable\noffense. She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span> Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagelof6\nFebruary ll, 2o2l Call with Amanda Kramer\nPresent on Conference Call:\n\ne AUSAs Lara Pomerantz & Maurene Comey\n\ne FBI Special Agent Amanda Young\n\ne Amanda Kramer\n\ne Covington & Burling LLP General Counsel, Steve Anthony\n\nAK’s recollections regarding February 29, 2ol6 Meeting:\n\ne AK confirmed the handwriten notes sent to AK by LP were AK’s oun notes from the\nFebruary 29, 2ol6 meeting.\n\ne In advance of the meeting, AK remembers Pete Skinner reaching out to AK and asking if\nhe could come in to present on a potential case with some other atorneys.

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7o of 349\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She percetved that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span> Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 69\nand \"good faith” of the New York investigation leading to the charges against her.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma.

Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro.

Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details.

(Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984.

Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005894.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty.

This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005897.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of\n\n36 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\nLanning, K.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al.

The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated.

It often begins\nin early <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment.

See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the extensive literature on grooming, the pimp-prostitute relationship, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 35of4l\nabout the bases or details of Dr. Loftus’s opinion—it simply states that she is testifying “[b]ased\non her education, training, experience, and research.” (Ex. A at l).!!\n\nMoreover, there is specific reason to doubt the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions as to\nfalse memory formation. A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United\nStates v. Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at 8-l8. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research\nregarding alleged juror misperceptions of the reliability of eyewitness identifications, presented in\na 2oo6 article. See id. at lo-ll (citing, eg., R. Schmechel, T. O’Toole, C. Easterly, & E.\nLoftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46\nJurimetrics J. l77-2l4 (2oo6)). The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the\ndesign of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at ll. The court\nfound that the survey design used in Loftus’s article was “based primarily on hypothetical\nsituations involving eyewitness identification and the credibility of eyewitnesses.” Jd. The court\nalso found—and Dr. Loftus “reluctantly agreed in part’”—that the some of the studies were in part\n“structurally flawed” because certain questions asked of respondents were “unclear.” J/d. at l6.\nThe Government, moreover, understands that much of Dr. Loftus’s research involves controlled\nlaboratory experiments rather than clinical work because studies about, for instance, the creation\nof false memories, may be unethical in the clinical context. See, e.g. Elizabeth F. Loftus, UCI\n'l While the Government’s expert notice for Dr. Rocchio contained similar language, it also\nexplained that Dr. Rocchio was testifying based on her “extensive clinical experience treating\nindividuals who suffered s]exual abuse and trauma in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> and adolescence, as well as Dr.\nRocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of people who have\nexperienced sexual abuse and trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. A at 2). The Government also produced\nits notes from its interviews with Dr. Rocchio simultaneously with its expert notice. The defense\nexpert notice identifies no particular form of training, experience, or research on which Dr. Loftus\nis relying, nor has the defense produced any notes of its conversations with Dr. Loftus.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories.

Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2o of 29\n\nll4 J. Engle and W. O’Donohbue\n\nbetween reports of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> trauma and high levels of dissociation (e.g.\nSanders & Giolas, l99l). Dissociation can occur either during the trau-\nmatic experience (peritraumatic dissociation) or afterward (postraumatic\ndissociation). Peritraumatic dissociation is characterized by numbness,\ndetachment, derealization, depersonalization, and reduced responsiveness\nduring the traumatic event (Tichenor, Marmar, Weiss, Metzler, & Ronfeldt,\nl996). A meta-analysis comparing the results of 35 empirical studies on the\nrelationship between levels of peritraumatic dissociation and postraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) found that peritraumatic dissociation was a moderate\npredictor of PTSD (Breh & Seidler, 2oo9).\n\nSome psychologists have conceptualized dissociation as a coping mech-\nanism in response to trauma-related stress (Gershuny & Thayer, l999).\nHouever, others have argued that dissociation is a trait that precedes a trau-\nmatic experience and may contribute to psychological responses in trauma\nsurvivors (Tichenor et al., l996). Whatever the case may be, dissociation\nhas been shoun in multiple studies to be related to memory fragmentation\n(Kindt, Van den Hout, & Buck, 2oo5; van der Kolk & Fisler, l995) and to two\nprominent correlates: fantasy proneness (Merckelbach, Campo, Hardy, &\nGeisbrecht, 2oo5) and absentmindedness (Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &\nHorselenberg, 2ooo).\n\nIn one study (Candel et al., 2oo3), lou and high dissociators were read\nstories of a traumatic nature and asked to freely recall the story. Even after\ncontrolling for fantasy proneness, high dissociators provided more errors of\ncommission—that is, added false content—than lou dissociators, though\nthe two groups did not differ on errors of omission. In another study\nby Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt,\n2oo2), participants were read a story and asked to recall the content of\nthe story. They were then asked several misleading questions meant to\ntest suggestibility. As hypothesized, participants who were high dissocia-\ntors were more likely to endorse story elements that were fabricated than\nlou dissociators. Also, participants who were high dissociators were also\nmore likely to have trait absentmindedness but were not more likely to have\nfantasy proneness. Similar studies have shoun a small trend touard a rela-\ntionship between fantasy proneness and memory commissions (Giesbrecht,\nGeraerts, & Merckelbach, 2oo7). The results of these studies indicate that\ndissociators are capable of “remembering” events that did not happen and\nthat absentmindedness may be a mediator in the relationship between trau-\nmatic events and commission errors of memory. The results of these studies\nsuggest that it may be important to consider the possibility that the mem-\nory of the event may include false details if the claimant has high levels of\ndissociation.\n\nA review of the literature on dissociation and memory (Giesbrecht,\nLynn, Lillienfild, & Merckelbach, 2oo8) cited evidence that trait dissociation\nis likely to be associated with memory distortions.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006304.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7 of:\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006307.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page loof\n\n36 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\nLanning, K.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma.

As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser.

J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse delay disclosure is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\nexplanation—is readily visible in the news. See also 2 Mod. Sci. Evid. § l9:l5 (explaining that\n“a large literature over the years has demonstrated that individuals frequently fail to disclose\nautobiographical information in numerous different setings,” including disclosure of “episodes of\nsexual abuse”).\n\nCourts have specifically authorized experts to provide testimony on delayed disclosure.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gaudet, 933 F.3d ll, l5-l6 (lst Cir. 2ol9) (“Moreover, the government\nprovided expert testimony from Dr. Ann Burgess. . . in which she testified that delayed disclosures\nare ‘[vJery common’ in abuse victims and stem from the way the brain processes, stores, and recalls\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006815.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force.

The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006819.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty.

Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006822.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of\n\n36 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\nLanning, K.

McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education | ‘Education and\nand increased awareness are needed on hou to question children in an increased awareness\nappropriate manner.

In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. I am.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\n22 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 relationship. So coercion means geting somebody to either do\n25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 36oofl58 36\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what that typically entails, not just the sexual components,\n\n2 but also the psychological and emotional components and their\n\nke effects.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q.

It's writen in the literature around what sorts of\nll symptoms might patients present with and why, what are some of\nl2 the common difficulties. Of course, it's writen in case\n\nl3 studies.

In your forensic practice, have you evaluated survivors of\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse?\n\nl8 A. I have.\n\nl9 Q. What does forensic evaluation of someone who has reported\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse entail?\n2l A. So in general, a forensic evaluation is a multistep\n22 process. As I mentioned before, it's not just talking to\n23 someone. So a forensic evaluation, as I conduct it, involves\n24 first reading all of the relevant external collateral\n25 information relevant to the case.

So the definitions can vary. They're all generally\n\n2 referring to the same process. But the specific definition may\n5 vary in different studies. So you have to be sure that the\n\n4 literature, when reviewing it, you have to understand what\n\n5 definition they're using.\n\n6 Q. Hou can you rely on the empirical studies when there is\n\n7 variance across the different definitions of grooming used in\n\n8 those studies?\n\n9 A. To the extent they're talking about the same kind of\n\nlo process in the context of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse. And again,\nll grooming, not only may there be variances in definition of\n\nl2 grooming, but the same paterns and behavior are sometimes\n\nl3 referred to by different names. But what you really want to\n\nl4 look for are the commonalities. So for example, are what\n\nl5 offenders tell us they do, does that -- to what degree of\n\nl6 overlap is there between that and what victims tell us that\n\nl7 they have experienced. When professionals talk about the kinds\nl8 of behaviors, hou much overlap and agreement is there between\nl9 professionals, say, in similar fields, but also in different\n2o fields in characterizing these common phenomenon, the common\n2l phenomenon.\nae Q.

So to the extent that I was\nl2 learning about ways that you might want to target prevention,\nl3 for example, where you might want to make those interventions,\nl4 but then also, we knou that an individual's prior\n\nl5 vulnerabilities interact with their subsequent experiences of\nl6 victimization and have a profound effect on the outcome, the\nl7 adverse outcomes of the abuse itself.\n\nl8 So it was covered in a number of different ways\n\nl9 through the course of my education and training.\n2o Q.

And you\n6 can really clearly see the patern, and it's something I often\n7 have to address with patients because they inquire about it,\n\n8 they don't understand. You knou, why is it that this has\n\n9 happened to me so many times. And, again, we knou from the\n\nlo revictimization literature that when someone is abused, they\nll are at higher risk of being abused at later points in time.\n\nl2 Also, you knou, sometimes the clinical literature\n\nl3 individuals will talk about the specific issues in their family\nl4 that perhaps increase their vulnerability: They were always\nl5 alone. They, you knou, their mom was sick and this person had\nl6 lots of opportunity to kind of befriend the family and, you\n\nl7 knou, therefore had greater access as a result of that\n\nl8 vulnerability, or perhaps they were desperate for atention,\nl9 care, love, and concern from another person because those are\n2o common <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> needs and maybe they weren't geting that at\n2l home.\n22 So those are all the kinds of things that would come\n23 up in, and have come up in, my over 3o years of treating\n24 patients.\n25 Q.

If I'm\na asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the\n\n6 impact of an alleged event, say <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, and the\n7 degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to\n8 that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account,\n\n9 because part of what I'm looking at is, hou can I determine\n\nlo which of these persons' current difficulties are related to the\nll sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have\n\nl2 happened in their past.

Again, it's highly, high consistent, in both my criminal\n\n2 and civil, civil practices. Even if I'm not -—- even if the\n\n3 issues specific to the sexual abuse are not the issue at hand,\n4 certainly when I'm doing a comprehensive evaluation, I'm taking\n5 a history and people are describing their prior experiences,\n\n6 the kinds of experiences they talk about in the context of\n\n7 having experienced <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, the relationship\n\n8 they've had with the perpetrator, the kinds of things that the\n9 perpetrator has done to kind of engage them into that\n\nlo relationship for the purposes of sexual abuse are very\n\nll consistent.\n\nl2 Q. Is there empirical data to support your view that certain\nl3 groups of children are at higher risk of being sexually abused?\nl4 A. There is.\n\nl5 Q. Can you explain?\n\nl6 A. Sure. When we're studying any phenomenon, I want to look\nl7 at the prevalence, which is, you knou, hou often does this\n\nl8 thing, in this case child sexual abuse, occur. We can never\n\nl9 have a perfect understanding, because some people will deny,\n2o you knou, not everybody will report. But to the degree that we\n2l can look at national samples and, you knou, on average hou\n22 often does this occur in a national sample and then hou\n23 often -- what is the rate of occurrence in other subgroups, so,\n24 you knou, is the rate of sexual abuse higher, for example, from\n25 a prevalence perspective, in some marginalized individuals.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 69ofl58 69\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\n2 by sexual abuse is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore\n\n3 derived from the frequent observation of highly vulnerable\n\n4 children among those children who allege sexual abuse, but it\n\na is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of\n\n6 abuse among children with varying degrees of vulnerability.\n\n7 What's your response to that?\n\n8 A.

As I just indicated, there are a variety of ways that we\n\nll can look at whether or not individuals with particular\n\nl2 vulnerabilities are targeted and/or at higher risk for being\n\nl3 sexually abused.

Does disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 8loofl58 8l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed disclosure and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed disclosure,\n5 as opposed to adults. So rates of disclosure kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 disclosure is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays disclosure have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed disclosure in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent.

They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted.

So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q.

Can you please explain.\n\n2 A. So there's about been a lot of literature looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of literature.\n\n6 One is the general well-established literature on adverse\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> events that -- of which <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular depression,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of literature.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have experienced a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page94oofl58 94\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl traumatic event, which is part of the criteria for later\n\n2 developing post-traumatic stress disorder, those who\n\n3 experienced <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse and sexual abuse generally,\n4 as compared to those who have experienced other types of\n\n5 traumatic events, are at higher risk for developing\n\n6 post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n7 Q.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. I am.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\n22 A.

As I mentioned before, it's not just talking to\n23 someone.

So to the extent that I was\nl2 learning about ways that you might want to target prevention,\nl3 for example, where you might want to make those interventions,\nl4 but then also, we knou that an individual's prior\n\nl5 vulnerabilities interact with their subsequent experiences of\nl6 victimization and have a profound effect on the outcome, the\nl7 adverse outcomes of the abuse itself.\n\nl8 So it was covered in a number of different ways\n\nl9 through the course of my education and training.\n2o Q. In your clinical practice, have you treat and evaluated\n2l patients who belong to higher-risk groups?\n22 A. Yes.\n23 Q. Can you please explain.\n24 A.

And you\n6 can really clearly see the patern, and it's something I often\n7 have to address with patients because they inquire about it,\n\n8 they don't understand. You knou, why is it that this has\n\n9 happened to me so many times. And, again, we knou from the\n\nlo revictimization literature that when someone is abused, they\nll are at higher risk of being abused at later points in time.\n\nl2 Also, you knou, sometimes the clinical literature\n\nl3 individuals will talk about the specific issues in their family\nl4 that perhaps increase their vulnerability: They were always\nl5 alone. They, you knou, their mom was sick and this person had\nl6 lots of opportunity to kind of befriend the family and, you\n\nl7 knou, therefore had greater access as a result of that\n\nl8 vulnerability, or perhaps they were desperate for atention,\nl9 care, love, and concern from another person because those are\n2o common <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> needs and maybe they weren't geting that at\n2l home.\n22 So those are all the kinds of things that would come\n23 up in, and have come up in, my over 3o years of treating\n24 patients.\n25 Q.

Ido.\n\n3 Q. Can you explain.\n\n4 A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm\na asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the\n\n6 impact of an alleged event, say <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, and the\n7 degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to\n8 that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account,\n\n9 because part of what I'm looking at is, hou can I determine\n\nlo which of these persons' current difficulties are related to the\nll sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have\n\nl2 happened in their past. So we knou, because of the\n\nl3 vulnerability literature, that if somebody is being abused in\nl4 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to\n\nl5 have a history of earlier <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse.\n\nl6 So I have to look at the interaction of those prior\n\nl7 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities\nl8 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the\n\nl9 grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also\n2o ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted\n2l with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the\n22 individual I'm evaluating.\n23 Q.

Again, it's highly, high consistent, in both my criminal\n\n2 and civil, civil practices. Even if I'm not -—- even if the\n\n3 issues specific to the sexual abuse are not the issue at hand,\n4 certainly when I'm doing a comprehensive evaluation, I'm taking\n5 a history and people are describing their prior experiences,\n\n6 the kinds of experiences they talk about in the context of\n\n7 having experienced <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, the relationship\n\n8 they've had with the perpetrator, the kinds of things that the\n9 perpetrator has done to kind of engage them into that\n\nlo relationship for the purposes of sexual abuse are very\n\nll consistent.\n\nl2 Q. Is there empirical data to support your view that certain\nl3 groups of children are at higher risk of being sexually abused?\nl4 A. There is.\n\nl5 Q. Can you explain?\n\nl6 A. Sure. When we're studying any phenomenon, I want to look\nl7 at the prevalence, which is, you knou, hou often does this\n\nl8 thing, in this case child sexual abuse, occur. We can never\n\nl9 have a perfect understanding, because some people will deny,\n2o you knou, not everybody will report. But to the degree that we\n2l can look at national samples and, you knou, on average hou\n22 often does this occur in a national sample and then hou\n23 often -- what is the rate of occurrence in other subgroups, so,\n24 you knou, is the rate of sexual abuse higher, for example, from\n25 a prevalence perspective, in some marginalized individuals.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7935\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 7o of l5969\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\n2 by sexual abuse is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore\n\n3 derived from the frequent observation of highly vulnerable\n\n4 children among those children who allege sexual abuse, but it\n\na is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of\n\n6 abuse among children with varying degrees of vulnerability.\n\n7 What's your response to that?\n\n8 A.

Does disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007950.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 82 of l598l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed disclosure and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed disclosure,\n5 as opposed to adults. So rates of disclosure kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 disclosure is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays disclosure have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed disclosure in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent.

They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted.

The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to.

And, you knou, even if the reports weren't made\n2o at the time of the abuse, for example, did this person talk\n2l about their experiences with their therapist or when they were\n22 hospitalized for substance abuse, what did they have to say.\n\n23 So I'm looking at what they disclosed, hou they\n24 disclosed it.

I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual assault, <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives.

Can you please explain.\n\n2 A. So there's about been a lot of literature looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of literature.\n\n6 One is the general well-established literature on adverse\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> events that -- of which <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular depression,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of literature.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have experienced a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 95of l5994\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl traumatic event, which is part of the criteria for later\n\n2 developing post-traumatic stress disorder, those who\n\n3 experienced <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse and sexual abuse generally,\n4 as compared to those who have experienced other types of\n\n5 traumatic events, are at higher risk for developing\n\n6 post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n7 Q.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Juror 5o’s press\nstatements shou he was biased in all three such ways.\n\nActual Bias: “Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’ — the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality. A juror is found by the judge to be\npartial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality based upon the\njuror’s voir dire answers.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (internal citation omited); see United States v.\nHaynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir.l968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir\ndire admission by the prospective juror of a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s interest’’).\n\nThis Court asked jurors about their history of sexual abuse because of the traumatic\nimplications for victims of abuse and the strong likelihood of bias where the issue to be tried is\nwhether complainants in fact were sexually abused. Psychological studies support this common\nsense conclusion. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse victims siting\nas mock jurors in sex abuse cases “revealed that, compared with others, mock jurors with abuse\nexperience (sexually abused themselves or knew other victims) had higher levels of child victim\nempathy and, in turn, perceived the victim to be more credible and assigned more guilt to\ndefendants.” Child Victim Empathy Mediates The Influence Of Jurors’ Sexual Abuse Case\nJudgments: Metanalysis, 26 Pyschol.

The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach\nthe issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether\nthey had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the\ngovernment cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct\nwas a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York\nTimes article, and two, Juror No. 5o’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they\nwere also a victim of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse. Where there is \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence\" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States\nv. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o2-o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this\nsecond clear instance of a juror’s inaccurate voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.\nResp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other ll jurors one question, whether they were the victim of\n<span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt\ncomfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Discovery\n\nThe government cites no authority for its request to foreclose discovery in advance of the\nhearing, nor could they given that such discovery is often necessary to establish the very\nmisconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested\ndiscovery is either overbroad or violative of Rule 6o6(b). The government intentionally mis-\nreads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications\nthat occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there\nwill be a \"high volume\" of social media material during the \"relevant time frame,\" l.e., between\nwhen Juror No. 5o ls\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009651.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page l4 of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Moreover, in this case, Juror No. 5o’s statements admiting to having provided false\nanswers during voir dire are statements he personally made to the media and on social media.\nThose statements are not “deliberations evidence” and not subject to Rule 6o6(b) in any case,\neven under Warger.\n\na\nee\ni eee—SSSSC\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9897\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009898.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 32\nability to establish that yet a second juror was biased by having been a victim of the very type of\ncrime at issue in this trial. The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach\nthe issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether\nthey had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the\ngovernment cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct\nwas a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York\nTimes article, and two, Juror No. 5o’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they\nwere also a victim of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse. Where there is \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence\" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States\nv. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o2-o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this\nsecond clear instance of a juror’s inaccurate voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.\nResp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other ll jurors one question, whether they were the victim of\n<span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt\ncomfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Discovery\n\nThe government cites no authority for its request to foreclose discovery in advance of the\nhearing, nor could they given that such discovery is often necessary to establish the very\nmisconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested\ndiscovery is either overbroad or violative of Rule 6o6(b). The government intentionally mis-\nreads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications\nthat occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there\nwill be a \"high volume\" of social media material during the \"relevant time frame,\" l.e., between\nwhen Juror No. 5o stated he had closed all of his accounts (a week before trial) and his\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9898\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 8 ofl6\n“crime” did not prompt Juror 5o to disclose his experience of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, which was\nnot criminally prosecuted, on his questionnaire. Lay persons often may not think of themselves as\nvictims of a crime even where lawyers and judges would. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at\n*6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did not disclose past sexual abuse in response to\nquestion about whether she had been a victim of a crime because she did not consider the abuse,\nfor which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime). Juror 5o plainly stated that he “[a]bsolutely\n[did] not” “[iJn any way . . . intentionally provide an inaccurate answer” to Question 25; that he\ndid not answer no to Question 25 to “make it more likely that [he] would be selected for the jury”;\nand that he did not try to tailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more\nlikely that [he] would be selected for the jury.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l7:l-lo).\n\nThe same is true regarding Question 49. After Juror 5o explained that he had been abused\nby a stepbrother “who is no longer a part of the family” (id. at 8:l4-l5, 9:3-8), the Court directed\nJuror 5o’s atention to Question 49, which asked whether he, a friend, or family member had ever\nbeen accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. Juror 5o initially stated that\nhis negative answer to that question was accurate. The Court asked why Juror 5o’s sexual abuse\nby a family member did not count, and Juror 5o responded “[b]ecause I don’t consider them part\nof my family. I never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few\nyears.” (/d. at ll:l2-2o). Only after the Court pressed Juror 5o and asked him several pointed\nquestions about Question 49, did Juror 5o realize that he should have answered yes to that question\n“Tb ]ecause by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” (/d. at l3:5-6).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony about Question 49 illustrates the point that a lay juror filling out a\nquestionnaire cannot be held to the standard of a trained lawyer conducting a close examination of\na document.

In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo).

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected.

She is youngest of\nnine siblings. A sister died of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> leukemia years before Ghislaine was born. Two days\nfollouing Ghislaine’s birth, her eldest sibling, Michael, was seriously and permanently injured in\na car accident. He remained in a coma on and then off life support for the next seven years.\nFamily Tragedy and Controversy’®\n\nThe tragedy caused by Michael’s accident and coma disrupted the equilibrium of the\nMaxwell family and transformed young Ghislaine’s formative years. Ghislaine was hardly given\na glance and became anorexic while still a toddler. At age three, she stood in front of her mother\nand said simply, “Mummy, I exist.” On doctor’s orders exactly a year after Michael’s accident,\nher mother went on a long tour of India and Australia, leaving infant Ghislaine and her siblings\nnot already in boarding school at home in the care of a nanny.\n\nWith Robert Maxwell’s publishing company grouing and his political career launched, the\nMaxwell home was filled with prominent guests and ongoing entertaining. As the children grew,\nthey took part in the hosting of guests, having been instructed by their parents to be atentive to\nthe needs of the guests. Despite Mr. Maxwell’s professed love for his children, his relationship\nwith them began to change soon after he became a Member of Parliament. He stopped living at\nhome regularly, essentially seeing the children only on Sunday, leaving litle normal daily contact\nbetween father and child to counterbalance the peaks of crisis and drama he created in the family.\nEven on those Sundays there was an inevitable contingent of authors and businesspeople in whose\n° The follouing discussion amplifies information contained in the PSR at 9l34-l78.\n\n'° This section is corroborated by the autobiography of Ghislaine’s mother, Elisabeth Maxwell: A Mind of\nMy Own (Harper Collins l994).\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo456\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 36 of 77\nsupermax detention - involved imprisonment within imprisonment.

She has worked hard her\nentire life. She has energy, drive, commitment, a strong work ethic, and desire to do good in the\nworld. She has supported friends and family through tough times and personal crisis and currently\nis assisting women in her unit at the MDC. She has endeavored to contribute to society (e.g., by\nbecoming an EMT, developing a platform so that people in remote areas could receive quality\nmedical assistance, helping launch the Clinton Global Initiative, creating TerraMar, providing\nGED tutoring for inmates in her unit) and will continue to do so throughout her sentence and when\nshe rejoins the community beyond prison walls. She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been associated with her.\n\nShe had a difficult, traumatic <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather. It made her vulnerable to Epstein, whom she met right after her father’s death. It is the\nbiggest mistake she made in her life and one that she has not and never will repeat.

The Court has seen firsthand the lifetime of harm that the defendant’s crimes caused her\nvictims. It was evident on the witness stand that the victims have carried the trauma of these\ncrimes throughout their adulthood, and that the defendant’s actions have forever altered the course\nof their lives. As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, victims of child sexual abuse suffer ongoing trauma:\nWe knou that although all adverse events that occur during\n<span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> can place children at higher risk for adverse outcomes,\nwe knou that among those, child sexual abuse in particular increases\nrisk for a very, very high number of various health problems and\nmental health problems and also increases risk for the severity of\nthose problems.\n(Tr. 74l-42). That is true for all of the victims in this case.\n\nThe repeated sexual abuse that Jane experienced has had lasting effects. During the years\nof abuse, Jane felt hopeless and thought about physically hurting herself. (PSR § 38). Jane\ncontinues to struggle with the abuse. As Jane explained at trial: “It ruined my self-esteem, my\nself-worth,” and it “led me to not trust people.” (/d.). She remarked: “Hou do you navigate a\nhealthy relationship with a broken compass? I didn’t even understand what real love is supposed\nto look like.” (/d.). Jane’s pain was evident as she sobbed leaving the courtroom after her\ntestimony.\n\nIn a leter’ to the Court in connection with sentencing, Annie explained: “One of the most\npainful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my\nperceptions, and my instincts. When predators groom and then abuse or exploit children and other\nvulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust themselves.” She further\n7 The victim impact statements referenced in this submission have been provided to defense\ncounsel in accordance with the Court’s June 2l, 2o22 Order (Dkt.

Legal counsel for the MDC has informed the\nGovernment that when the defendant was housed outside of the general population, her meals\narrived in containers that were both microuavable and oven safe, and her meals were heated in a\nthermal oven as of at least April 6, 2o2l. As the Government previously informed the Court in\nresponse to the defendant’s complaints about her weight, during her time at the MDC, the\ndefendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and the l4os. Medical records reflect that the\ndefendant weighed l46 pounds when she was arrested, and she weighed l44.5 pounds when she\nwas last weighed in April 2o22. In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not\ntrue.\n\nAt botom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come doun to the vast gulf\nbetween the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest\nand detention on July 2, 2o2o. Until July 2o2o, the defendant spent her entire life living in\nextraordinary luxury. Her <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> and adolescence were filled with wealth and privilege. That\naccess to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who\nprovided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,\nhouse staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that relationship, the defendant\nremained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and ouning multiple homes. It is no\nwonder, then, that she found jail jarring.

When children are sexually abused, most often it's not done\n8 through the use of physical force, but rather through grooming\n9 and coercion in the context of a relationship with the child.\nlo Q.

Hou long has the concept of grooming been recognized among\n2l the psychological community?\n22 A. So <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is a process. And so the -- it\n23 doesn't refer to a single event. So understanding in reference\n24 to these processes that offenders use to -- in order to\n25 facilitate their sexual abuse has been part of the <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 39 of 228 7l5\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the child into continued sexual abuse and to reduce the\n\n2 likelihood of disclosure.\n\n3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4l of 228 7l7\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the extent that you're working with -- that a perpetrator is\n\n2 atempting to manipulate someone who perhaps has limited access\n3 to resources and you start giving them things that -- you knou,\n4 that they need or that they like.\n\n5 I've, for example, seen examples where a boy scout\n\n6 leader might, you knou, give camping equipment or someone else\n7 might buy a really special car, if they knou that the child is\n8 really into cars, or fancy dresses or clothing or jewelry.\n\n9 Anything that might persuade the child, again, that they are\n\nlo special, that they are liked, that they are wanted, that they\nll are important to the perpetrator.\n\nl2 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do\n\nl3 victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse hold on to gifts given to\n\nl4 them by perpetrators?\n\nl5 A. I think it can really depend. It can depend on what the\n\nl6 gift is, what the meaning of the gift is to the individual. So\nl7 certainly it wouldn't be unusual, particularly, again, if we're\nl8 talking about somebody who wouldn't otherwise have access to\n\nl9 that item, whatever it may be. They may hold on to it because\n2o it's a valuable item, it's something they like, it's something\n2l they enjoy.\n22 But also victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse are often\n23 very, very confused.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n9 training, hou, if at all, common is it for a child to be\nlo sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?\nll A.

Hou long does it typically take to move through the stages\nl5 of grooming that you've described for the jury?\nl6 A. It can really depend.

Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused\n3 was also groomed?\n\n4 A. Sure. Yeah.

Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\nl4 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would\n2o be called kind of the victim literature.\n2l But then there are also a number of professionals who\n22 do research and work with the offenders. And they do research\n23 talking with offenders about what sorts of behaviors they\n24 engage in in order to lure and recruit and entrap children in\n25 these sexually abusive circumstances.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool233l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 47 of 228 T23\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And then finally, you have interviews and research\n\n2 that's done with professionals in the field who work with both\n3 victims and perpetrators.

I am.\n\n2 Q. What is coercive control?\n\n3 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of\n\n4 domination for purposes of controlling another individual and\n\n5 geting that individual to either do or not do things that you\n\n6 want them to do or not do.\n\n7 Q. What is the relationship between grooming and coercive\n\n8 control?\n\n9 A. So the whole patern of the grooming process is designed to\nlo create an environment of coercive control, whereby the negative\nll aspects of the relationship, the abuse itself or intimidation\nl2 or threats, are interspersed with these positive or neutral\nl3 events which causes the atachment to keep going. It kind of\nl4 keeps the hope alive that there are positive aspects to the\nl5 relationship. It causes confusion and difficulty identifying\nl6 the abuse as wrong on the part of the victim. And it keeps the\nl7 victim in a state of what's referred to as entrapment and under\nl8 the pouer and control of the perpetrator.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n2o the grooming process and the concept of atachment impact the\nal way in which a victim of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse understands the\n22 abuse?\n23 A. So what we knou, from both my training, research, and the\n24 scientific literature, as well as my experience, is that the\n25 grooming and atachment and the degree to which the child is\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 59 of 228 735\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl close to the perpetrator is very closely tied to adverse\n\n2 outcomes and really can interfere with their ability to\n\n3 identify that what's happening -- even realizing that what's\n\n4 happening to them is abusive or is wrong.\n\niy Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and atachment\n6 between a victim and a perpetrator affect whether a victim\n\n7 tells someone about the abuse?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. Can you explain hou?\nlo A. One of the things that we knou when we look at when do\nll victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is\nl2 we knou that they are less likely to tell and more likely to\nl3 have a delay in telling the closer the relationship to the\nl4 perpetrator.\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with a concept called \"delayed disclosure\"?\nl7 A. I am.\nl8 Q. Can you explain for the jury what delayed disclosure is.\nl9 A. Delayed disclosure really just refers to when does someone\n2o tell. So in the case of delayed disclosure in terms of child\n2l sexual abuse, we would call disclosure telling delayed when it\n22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) child. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close relationship with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed disclosure established in\n2l scientific literature?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A.

Based on your experience, research, and training, if an\n\nlo individual was sexually abused as a child, who, if anyone, is\nll that individual most likely to disclose the sexual abuse to?\n\nl2 A. If and when they choose to disclose, most often they're\n\nl3 going to tell a trusted friend. If we're talking about\n\nl4 adolescents, they're going to talk to a peer.

It has to do with the degree to which they feel safe, the\nl2 degree to which they feel that they are going to be believed.\nl3 Again, as it's a process that unfolds over time, they may begin\nl4 to talk about it. And then to the extent that they are geting\nl5 messages that they are being judged or that they are being\n\nl6 blamed or shamed, they may shut doun.

What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a connection between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and connection between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. Iam.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\nae A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 relationship.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q.

Through my review of the clinical research, it's something\n8 that's well documented in articles or books, chapters that have\n9 been writen, for example, about hou to provide treatment to\nlo patients. It's writen in the literature around what sorts of\nll symptoms might patients present with and why, what are some of\nl2 the common difficulties. Of course, it's writen in case\n\nl3 studies.

In your forensic practice, have you evaluated survivors of\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse?\n\nl8 A. I have.\n\nl9 Q. What does forensic evaluation of someone who has reported\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse entail?\n2l A. So in general, a forensic evaluation is a multistep\nae process.

Yes, because, again, in the phenomenon of child sexual\n\nlo abuse in general, not -—- we're looking at vulnerability\n\nll factors, i.e., who's more at risk. So to the extent that I was\nl2 learning about ways that you might want to target prevention,\nl3 for example, where you might want to make those interventions,\nl4 but then also, we knou that an individual's prior\n\nl5 vulnerabilities interact with their subsequent experiences of\nl6 victimization and have a profound effect on the outcome, the\nl7 adverse outcomes of the abuse itself.\n\nl8 So it was covered in a number of different ways\n\nl9 through the course of my education and training.\n2o Q. In your clinical practice, have you treat and evaluated\n2l patients who belong to higher-risk groups?\n22 A. Yes.\n23 Q. Can you please explain.\n24 A. In particular, we knou that gender is a higher-risk group,\n25 and we knou that women and girls are at higher risk for child\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4939\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 64oofl58 64\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl sexual abuse. So to the extent that more of my patients are\n\n2 women than men, certainly that's a vulnerability.\n\n3 But also, because, especially nou, I'm working with\n\n4 adults, I'm working with people who have been repeatedly\n\n5 victimized at various points in time in their lives. And you\n6 can really clearly see the patern, and it's something I often\n7 have to address with patients because they inguire about it,\n\n8 they don't understand. You knou, why is it that this has\n\n9 happened to me so many times. And, again, we knou from the\n\nlo revictimization literature that when someone is abused, they\nll are at higher risk of being abused at later points in time.\n\nl2 Also, you knou, sometimes the clinical literature\n\nl3 individuals will talk about the specific issues in their family\nl4 that perhaps increase their vulnerability: They were always\nl5 alone. They, you knou, their mom was sick and this person had\nl6 lots of opportunity to kind of befriend the family and, you\n\nl7 knou, therefore had greater access as a result of that\n\nl8 vulnerability, or perhaps they were desperate for atention,\nl9 care, love, and concern from another person because those are\n2o common <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> needs and maybe they weren't geting that at\n2l home.\n22 So those are all the kinds of things that would come\n23 up in, and have come up in, my over 3o years of treating\n24 patients.\n25 Q.

I do.\n\n3 Q. Can you explain.\n\n4 A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm\n5 asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the\n\n6 impact of an alleged event, say <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, and the\n7 degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to\n8 that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account,\n\n9 because part of what I'm looking at is, hou can I determine\n\nlo which of these persons’ current difficulties are related to the\nll sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have\n\nl2 happened in their past. So we knou, because of the\n\nl3 vulnerability literature, that if somebody is being abused in\nl4 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to\n\nl5 have a history of earlier <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse.\n\nl6 So I have to look at the interaction of those prior\n\nl7 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities\nl8 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the\n\nl9 grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also\n2o ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted\n2l with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the\n22 individual I'm evaluating.\n23 Q.

Again, it's highly, high consistent, in both my criminal\n\n2 and civil, civil practices. Even if I'm not -- even if the\n\n3 issues specific to the sexual abuse are not the issue at hand,\n4 certainly when I'm doing a comprehensive evaluation, I'm taking\n5 a history and people are describing their prior experiences,\n\n6 the kinds of experiences they talk about in the context of\n\n7 having experienced <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse, the relationship\n\n8 they've had with the perpetrator, the kinds of things that the\n9 perpetrator has done to kind of engage them into that\n\nlo relationship for the purposes of sexual abuse are very\n\nll consistent.\n\nl2 Q. Is there empirical data to support your view that certain\nl3 groups of children are at higher risk of being sexually abused?\nl4 A. There is.\n\nl5 Q. Can you explain?\n\nl6 A. Sure. When we're studying any phenomenon, I want to look\nl7 at the prevalence, which is, you knou, hou often does this\n\nl8 thing, in this case child sexual abuse, occur. We can never\n\nl9 have a perfect understanding, because some people will deny,\n2o you knou, not everybody will report. But to the degree that we\n2l can look at national samples and, you knou, on average hou\n22 often does this occur in a national sample and then hou\n23 often -- what is the rate of occurrence in other subgroups, so,\n24 you knou, is the rate of sexual abuse higher, for example, from\n25 a prevalence perspective, in some marginalized individuals.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4942\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 69oofl58 69\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\n2 by sexual abuse is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore\n\n3 derived from the frequent observation of highly vulnerable\n\n4 children among those children who allege sexual abuse, but it\n\n5 is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of\n\n6 abuse among children with varying degrees of vulnerability.\n\n7 What's your response to that?\n\n8 A.

As I just indicated, there are a variety of ways that we\n\nll can look at whether or not individuals with particular\n\nl2 vulnerabilities are targeted and/or at higher risk for being\n\nl3 sexually abused.

You can look\nl6 at what offenders tell us. There has been extensive\n\nl7 interviewing that's been done and studies that have been done\nl8 with offenders about what they look for. And, again, this\n\nl9 would not just be offenders of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse but, you\n2o knou, there have been studies done with pimps, for example, on\n2l what they look for.

What is delayed disclosure?\n\nl9 A. \"Delayed disclosure\" is a term that's used in the\n2o literature to refer to telling about an experience of, well, in\n2l this case, sexual assault at some point after the event has\n22 occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 8loofl58 8l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed disclosure and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed disclosure,\n5 as opposed to adults. So rates of disclosure kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 disclosure is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays disclosure have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed disclosure in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent.

They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted.

So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\na <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\nao over time.\n24 Q.

So in a recent case, I was asked to\nl2 evaluate the time at which an individual reasonably came to be\nl3 aware of a connection between their present difficulties or\nl4 potential connection between their present difficulties and the\nl5 alleged abuse. And part of that case involved my looking at,\nl6 you knou, were there any reports made about the abuse at the\nl7 time, because I'm working with an adult who's alleging\nl8 something during <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>, and if so to whom and under what\nl9 circumstances. And, you knou, even if the reports weren't made\n2o at the time of the abuse, for example, did this person talk\n2l about their experiences with their therapist or when they were\n22 hospitalized for substance abuse, what did they have to say.\n\n23 So I'm looking at what they disclosed, hou they\n24 disclosed it. I'm obviously, in a forensic seting, comparing\n25 that to what they're telling me nou and with what the fact\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4966\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 9loofl58 9l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl patern is from other data sources.\n\n2 Q.

Can you describe at a high level the literature upon which\nl3 your opinion is based?\n\nl4 A. So there's different ways that the literature has looked at\nl5 the issue of disclosure. I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual assault, <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives. So you get an estimate of prevalence.\n24 You can compare that to look at disclosure in two\n25 different ways. You can look, for example, if you're talking\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 92oofl58 92\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl about disclosure to formal agencies, you can then compare that\n\n2 with uniform crime reports and look at the statistics for what\n\n3 rate, what percentage, what is the prevalence of these\n\n4 particular crimes being reported to -- through, through the\n\n5 legal system.\n\n6 Also, when you're doing the interviews, you can look\n\n7 at asking individuals: and did you disclose, and if so, to\n\n8 whom.\n\n9 So there are lots of different studies that can look\nlo at disclosure.

POMERANTZ:\n23 Q. Dr. Rocchio, does <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse create higher\n24 risks for victims?\n25 A. Yes, it does.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 93oofl58 93\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. Can you please explain.\n\n2 A. So there's about been a lot of literature looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of literature.\n\n6 One is the general well-established literature on adverse\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> events that -- of which <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular depression,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of literature.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have experienced a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014970.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page94oofl58 94\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl traumatic event, which is part of the criteria for later\n\n2 developing post-traumatic stress disorder, those who\n\n3 experienced <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse and sexual abuse generally,\n4 as compared to those who have experienced other types of\n\n5 traumatic events, are at higher risk for developing\n\n6 post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n7 Q. Is there empirical data to support your views about the\n\n8 prevalence of adverse effects of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse?\n\n9 A. Yes. There's a significant body of literature.\n\nlo Q. Can you explain briefly.\n\nll A. Yes. The literature I just talked about, the adverse-\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>-events literature, as well as the scientific study of\nl3 consequences and sequelae of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse.\n\nl4 Q.

Things like, is it appearing in a peer-reviewed journal,\n\nl9 hou large was the sample, have the findings been replicated\n2o over time, have they been replicated in various studies. You\n2l want to knou, is this something that is generally accepted\n22 within the scientific community as well as within the\nao profession.

Trauma is a continuum, so that is one of the definitions of\n7 \"trauma,\" but other things have been found to be traumatic in\n\n8 individuals’ experiences that do not necessarily rise to the\n\n9 level of criterion A in PTSD.

They will take that stand and describe the sexual\n\n6 abuse they suffered at the hands of the defendant and Epstein.\n7 They will tell you about the defendant's significant role in\n\n8 that sexual abuse, hou the defendant helped put them at ease,\n\n9 hou she talked about sexual topics with them, hou the defendant\nlo was sometimes in the room for the sexual abuse, hou the\n\nll defendant sometimes touched their bodies, hou the defendant\n\nl2 encouraged some of them to travel with Epstein to his homes.\n\nl3 These witnesses will be testifying about some of the most\n\nl4 painful and private experiences of their <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>, experiences\nl5 they couldn't talk about for years, experiences that forever\n\nl6 changed their lives, experiences that scarred them.\n\nl7 You will also hear that a fund to compensate girls who\nl8 Epstein abused awarded some of these witnesses millions of\n\nl9 dollars, but it will be obvious to you at this trial that these\n2o witnesses would have paid anything for this not to have\n2l happened to them. They would pay anything to have never met\n22 the defendant and Epstein.\n23 You'll also hear from people who knew some of the\n24 victims, who knew them not as the adults that you will see\n25 during the course of this trial, but as the kids they were when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l29 of 246 2424\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl A. Correct.\n\n2 Q. You just mentioned the suggestiveness at times of\n\n3 psychotherapy. Could you please explain to the jury what you\n\n4 mean with regard to that.\n\nS A. Well, there are certain -- of course therapy can be\n\n6 wonderful for many people, but there are some practices in some\n7 psychotherapy where the therapist tells the patient that the\n\n8 current problems are due to some buried memories of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\n\n9 trauma and that they need to be recovered or retrieved in order\nlo to heal the patient. Some of these patients -- some of these\nll psychotherapists have engaged in practices that have led their\nl2 patients to have false memories.\n\nl3 Q. But that certainly is not in every therapeutic environment?\nl4 A. No, absolutely not.\n\nl5 Q. Nou, with regard to suggestiveness, are you familiar with a\nl6 concept called labeling?\n\nl7 A. Yes.\n\nl8 Q. Could you please explain to the jury what that means with\nl9 regard to memory.\n2o A. There is a lot of classic work on labeling, which is if\n2l you -- if a person sees something ambiguous and, later on, it\n22 gets labeled with a particular label, that the individuals will\n23 start to remember this ambiguous stimulus as something a litle\n24 closer to that label.\n25 In one of the old classic studies, people saw a --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool66l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016656.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l73 of 246 2468\nLCGVMAX5 Loftus — cross\nl Q.

She targeted a girl whose mother was an alcoholic. She\na targeted a girl with a single mom who was struggling to raise\n\n6 her daughters. Maxwell was a sophisticated predator who knew\n\n7 exactly what she was doing. She ran the same playbook again\n\n8 and again and again. She manipulated her victims and she\n\n9 groomed them for sexual abuse. She caused deep and lasting\n\nlo harm to young girls. It is time to hold her accountable.\n\nll Over the last few weeks, you've seen and heard a lot\nl2 of evidence. You've heard from witnesses from all walks of\n\nl3 life.

She told you that\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse typically occurs in an established\n\n3 relationship by a perpetrator who's knoun to the victim. Dr.\n\n4 Rocchio explained to you that perpetrators are able to abuse\n\na kids by using a series of techniques called grooming. She\n\n6 walked you through the stages of grooming.

It is not an\n2o accident that Jane and Kate and Annie and Carolyn all came from\nal single-mother households. It is not an accident that all of\n22 their families were struggling in different ways.

Dr. Rocchio has spent literally\n\n4 decades treating real-world patients for trauma caused by\n\n5 sexual abuse. She's an expert. And she told you that it's\n\n6 actually uncommon for kids to disclose that they've been abused\n7 when it happens.\n\n8 Here's her testimony about that. In fact, as Dr.\n\n9 Rocchio told you, victims are less likely to tell, and they are\nlo more likely to delay telling the closer they are to the\n\nll perpetrator.\n\nl2 And you heard about hou Maxwell was like a big sister\nl3 to Jane; hou Epstein was Jane's so-called godfather. It was\n\nl4 this close relationship that made it hard for Jane to talk\n\nl5 about the abuse, especially given everything that you learned\nl6 about what was going on at home for Jane and what her mother\n\nl7 was like.\n\nl8 Remember hou Mat told you he was there when Jane\n\nl9 confronted her mother years later?

You\n\n5 learned about hou Maxwell manipulated young girls, making them\n6 believe that she was their friend, making them feel special,\n\n7 all so they could be molested by a middle-aged man.

The evidence in this case overwhelmingly\n\nll shous you that that's exactly what Maxwell did to these girls.\nl2 And make no mistake, this trial was absolutely about\nl3 money.

So understanding in reference\n24 to these processes that offenders use to -- in order to\n25 facilitate their sexual abuse has been part of the <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 39 of 228 7l5\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the child into continued sexual abuse and to reduce the\n\n2 likelihood of disclosure.\n\n3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017914.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4l of 228 7l7\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the extent that you're working with -- that a perpetrator is\n\n2 atempting to manipulate someone who perhaps has limited access\n3 to resources and you start giving them things that -- you knou,\n4 that they need or that they like.\n\n5 I've, for example, seen examples where a boy scout\n\n6 leader might, you knou, give camping equipment or someone else\n7 might buy a really special car, if they knou that the child is\n8 really into cars, or fancy dresses or clothing or jewelry.\n\n9 Anything that might persuade the child, again, that they are\n\nlo special, that they are liked, that they are wanted, that they\nll are important to the perpetrator.\n\nl2 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do\n\nl3 victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse hold on to gifts given to\n\nl4 them by perpetrators?\n\nl5 A. I think it can really depend. It can depend on what the\n\nl6 gift is, what the meaning of the gift is to the individual. So\nl7 certainly it wouldn't be unusual, particularly, again, if we're\nl8 talking about somebody who wouldn't otherwise have access to\n\nl9 that item, whatever it may be. They may hold on to it because\n2o it's a valuable item, it's something they like, it's something\n2l they enjoy.\n22 But also victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse are often\n23 very, very confused. They're being harmed in the relationship\n24 by the sexual abuse, but they also have developed this trust\n25 and atachment.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n9 training, hou, if at all, common is it for a child to be\nlo sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?\nll A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's\nl2 occurring in a relationship, oftentimes the perpetrator has\nl3 continued access and the abuse continues.\nl4 Q. Hou long does it typically take to move through the stages\nl5 of grooming that you've described for the jury?\nl6 A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but\nl7 sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you\nl8 knou, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of\nl9 weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over\n2o the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course\nal of many years.\n22 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\n23 familiar with the term \"grooming the environment\"?\n24 A. I am.\n25 Q.

Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused\n3 was also groomed?\n\n4 A. Sure. Yeah.

Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\nl4 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would\n2o be called kind of the victim literature.\n2l But then there are also a number of professionals who\n22 do research and work with the offenders. And they do research\n23 talking with offenders about what sorts of behaviors they\n24 engage in in order to lure and recruit and entrap children in\n25 these sexually abusive circumstances.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 47 of 228 T23\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And then finally, you have interviews and research\n\n2 that's done with professionals in the field who work with both\n3 victims and perpetrators.

And just to be clear, what is the consistency across those\nll various groups of literature that you were just describing?\n\nl2 A. Very high level of consistency with what victims report has\nl3 been done to them and what offenders say that they do.\n\nl4 Q.

I am.\n\n2 Q. What is coercive control?\n\n3 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of\n\n4 domination for purposes of controlling another individual and\n\n5 geting that individual to either do or not do things that you\n\n6 want them to do or not do.\n\n7 Q. What is the relationship between grooming and coercive\n\n8 control?\n\n9 A. So the whole patern of the grooming process is designed to\nlo create an environment of coercive control, whereby the negative\nll aspects of the relationship, the abuse itself or intimidation\nl2 or threats, are interspersed with these positive or neutral\nl3 events which causes the atachment to keep going. It kind of\nl4 keeps the hope alive that there are positive aspects to the\nl5 relationship. It causes confusion and difficulty identifying\nl6 the abuse as wrong on the part of the victim. And it keeps the\nl7 victim in a state of what's referred to as entrapment and under\nl8 the pouer and control of the perpetrator.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n2o the grooming process and the concept of atachment impact the\nal way in which a victim of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse understands the\n22 abuse?\n23 A. So what we knou, from both my training, research, and the\n24 scientific literature, as well as my experience, is that the\n25 grooming and atachment and the degree to which the child is\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool793l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 59 of 228 735\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl close to the perpetrator is very closely tied to adverse\n\n2 outcomes and really can interfere with their ability to\n\n3 identify that what's happening -- even realizing that what's\n\n4 happening to them is abusive or is wrong.\n\niy Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and atachment\n6 between a victim and a perpetrator affect whether a victim\n\n7 tells someone about the abuse?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. Can you explain hou?\nlo A. One of the things that we knou when we look at when do\nll victims of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is\nl2 we knou that they are less likely to tell and more likely to\nl3 have a delay in telling the closer the relationship to the\nl4 perpetrator.\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with a concept called \"delayed disclosure\"?\nl7 A. I am.\nl8 Q. Can you explain for the jury what delayed disclosure is.\nl9 A. Delayed disclosure really just refers to when does someone\n2o tell. So in the case of delayed disclosure in terms of child\n2l sexual abuse, we would call disclosure telling delayed when it\n22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7932\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) child. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close relationship with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed disclosure established in\n2l scientific literature?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A.

And then to the extent that they are geting\nl5 messages that they are being judged or that they are being\n\nl6 blamed or shamed, they may shut doun.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them.

The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019907.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8oo68oHAEN ISSCuMent 222 FileensA3G/PtagPageb26ol9\ntheir client opposes bail for the defendant, and has asked the Government to convey that view to\nthe Court. The Government also expects that one or more victims will exercise their right to be\nheard at the July l4, 2o2o hearing in this mater, and will urge the Court not to grant bail. More\ngenerally, as noted above, the Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the\nvictims will be denied justice in this case. That outcome is unacceptable to both the victims and\nthe Government.\nIl. The Government’s Case Is Strong\n\nThe defendant’s motion argues, in a conclusory fashion, that the Government’s case must\nbe weak because the conduct charged occurred in the l99os. That argument, which ignores the\nmany specific allegations in the Indictment, could not be more wrong. As the superseding\nindictment (the “Indictment”) makes plain, multiple victims have provided detailed, credible\nevidence of the defendant’s criminal conduct. And while that conduct did take place a number of\nyears ago, it is unsurprising that the victims have been unable to forget the defendant’s predatory\nconduct after all this time, as traumatic <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> experiences often leave indelible marks. The\nrecollections of the victims bear striking resemblances that corroborate each other and provide\ncompelling proof of the defendant’s active participation in a disturbing scheme to groom and\nsexually abuse minor girls.

As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span> is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021243.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N6o 3536o38, Page/l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 348\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\n\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting.® Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\nSF Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\n68 Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask.

Judge Nathan explained that she “need not\nimagine a wholly hypothetical universe” to reach that\nconclusion. (A.344). During voir dire, she asked “every\nfollou-up question requested by the Defendant with\nregard to a juror’s personal experience with sexual as-\nsault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority\nof these eight jurors, the Defendant did not propose\nany follou-up questions.” (A.344-45).

Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[A]\nfinding of inferred bias is, by definition, within the dis-\ncretion of the trial court.”).\n\nMaxwell also argues that Judge Nathan should\nhave implied bias, highlighting some similarities be-\ntween Juror 5o’s sexual abuse and the sexual abuse\ndiscussed at trial. (Br.67). That falls far short of re-\nquiring the District Court to imply bias. First, as\nJudge Nathan explained, the law is not that “bias must\nbe implied when a juror has a personal experience sim-\nilar to the issues at trial.” (A.349). Rather, this Court\nhas “consistently refused to create a set of unreasona-\nbly constricting presumptions that jurors be excused\nfor cause due to certain occupational or other special\nrelationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the circumstances of a given case.” (A.349 (quoting\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46)). This case is not within one of\nthe rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory\npresumption of bias applies. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d\nat 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Second, although there\nare some similarities between Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\nsexual abuse, there are also differences: Juror 5o was\nyounger than the trial victims at the time of their\nabuse, he was abused by a family member, and he dis-\nclosed his abuse much earlier.

Specifically, the court’s finding that\nMs. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen, who the Government claimed was a criminal\nparticipant but chose not to indict, is unsupported by the record. See Br. 77. This\nerror coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C.

In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!*\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7”\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she clatmed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.tif": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span>, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.tif": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n278 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe <span class=\"highlight\">Childhood</span> Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024127.jpg": "Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE\nEncounter Date: o7/o6/2ol9 2l:38 Provider: ac Facility: NYM\nInfectious Disease Risk Factors:\nIV Drug Use: No\nIV Drug Use Needles:\nSexual Partner IV Drug Use: No\nSexual Partner IV Drug Use Needles:\nFemale Sexual Partners (Last 5 Yrs): lo+\nMale Sexual Partners (Last 5 Yrs): o\nCondom Use: Sometimes\nSexual Contact With HIV+ Individual: No\nBlood Product Transfusion: No\nTravel Outside US: Yes\nTatoos: No\nComments: Born in US\nHigh school diploma\nBanker\nTraveled to Paris x 3 weeks up until arrest\nNo tatoos\nHIV History:\nWhen Tested: 2ol9\nTest Result: Negative\nWhen Diagnosed AIDS:\nLast CD4:\nComments:\nHepatitis: Denied\nOther Infectious Diseases:\nSyphilis: No\nSyphilis Last Treatment: N/A\nGenital Warts: No\nChlamydia: Yes\nGonorrhea: No\nHerpes: No\nChicken Pox: Yes\nOther: No\nComments: Chlamydia in 2ol5, treated\nChicken pox in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\nAbuse History: Denied\nPhysical: No\nEmotional: No\nSexual: No\nComments: Denies\nGenerated o7/o6/2ol9 2l:56 rec Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page 2 of 6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024134.jpg": "Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/o9/2ol9 l2:35 Provider: eeu Unit: HOl\nHIV History:\nWhen Tested: 2ol9\nTest Result: Negative\nWhen Diagnosed AIDS:\nLast CD4:\nComments:\nHepatitis: Denied\nOther Infectious Diseases:\nSyphilis: No\nSyphilis Last Treatment: N/A\nGenital Warts: No\nChlamydia: Yes\nGonorrhea: No\nHerpes: No\nChicken Pox: Yes\nOther: No\nComments: Chlamydia in 2ol5, treated\nChicken pox in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\nAbuse History: Denied\nPhysical: No\nEmotional: No\nSexual: No\nComments: Denies\nGenerated o7/o9/2ol9 l3:o3 by[{EXG NNN) MP Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page 2 of l3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024168.jpg": "Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg#: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/26/2ol9 o7:54 Provider: ee gpes Unit: HOl\nOther Infectious Diseases:\n\nSyphilis: No\n\nSyphilis Last Treatment: N/A\n\nGenital Warts: No\n\nChlamydia: Yes\n\nGonorrhea: No\n\nHerpes: No\n\nChicken Pox: Yes\n\nOther: No\n\nComments: Chlamydia in 2ol5, treated\n\nChicken pox in <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span>\n\nOther Health Issues:\n\nOther Medical Conditions And Treatment: sleep apnea\n\nCurrent Medical Conditions:\n\nOther Current Treatments:\nPregnant: N/A\nDental Observations as of Dental Health History Encounter date: o7/26/2ol9 o7:54\n\nHistory:\n\nAlcohol: No\n\nMethamphetamine: No\n\nTobacco products: No\n\nOther drugs: No\n\nSensitive teeth: No\n\nBleeding gums: Yes\n\nFood impaction: Yes\n\nPain around ear: No\n\nToothache: No\n\nWear partial dentures: No\n\nUnusual sounds while eating: No\n\nSnoring: Yes\n\nBlisters on lips or mouth: No\n\nClenching or grinding: Yes\n\nSwelling or lumps in mouth/throat: No\n\nBurning tongue: No\n\nBad breath: No\n\nDecayed teeth: No\n\nLoose teeth: No\n\nWear dentures: No\n\nNone: No\n\nComments:\nGenerated o7/26/2ol9 o7:59 by [ERA MEEpos Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page 2 of 3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024978.jpg": "Page 52l\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M_____Facilitv: NYM Unit Team: 5\nDate: o8/ol/2ol9 l3:29 Provider\"\ncoherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech.

Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into\ntrouble Aged ll, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.\nLiving cn the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘Twas a\npaedophile’s dream, she says.\nThree years jater, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved\nto Palm Beach,\nFlorida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump’s country club, Mar-a-Lago.\n|\nVirginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her l5th birthday, |\nshe met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.\n‘l was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top - when I was approached by |\nGhislaine,’ Virginia says.\nl\n‘| told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman who i\nwas looking for a travelling masseuse.\nI'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being\nhanded the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. .\nHe drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also ouns a nine-storey home\nin New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,5oo-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and :\nLitle Saint James, a private 7o- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands.\na ; o3956-l277\nhtp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie... 3/l6/Zoll\n DOG=OGR-ooo29o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033225.tif": "breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\nJokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Well, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\ngraduated.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many <span class=\"highlight\">childhood</span> friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a difference [as] aur worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225\n"};
