The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\n<span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo992", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000996.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBRGUsnt BOM 22o FilecoOAI3o2 aPage di226lol9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them.

In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank’).

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\n<span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l2 of l9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM.

El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo (N.D. Ohio 2ool). In E/-Sadig, the court held\nthat the defendant, who was alleged to have <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> firearms unlawfully for two members of\nthe Saudi royal family who had traveled with a Saudi prince to the United States, had standing to\nenforce an oral agreement between the government and the prince not to prosecute any of the\nindividuals involved in the purchase. l33 F. Supp. 2d at 6ol. The court concluded that “even if\nthe non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated to [the defendant], he can\nenforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party beneficiary.” Jd. at 6o8. Moreover, the\ncourt reasoned, because the prince himself “was not involved in any of the illegal activity, his\nefforts to obtain a commitment not to prosecute were obviously intended by him to benefit third-\nparties,” and therefore the defendant was a third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the\nagreement. Jd. at 6o9.\n\nBoth Florida West and El-Sadig illustrate hou the government’s argument that Ms.\nMaxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA is contrary to bedrock principles of contract law, as\napplied to immunity agreements. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants in Florida West and El-\nSadig were not parties to the agreements at issue. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants were not\nspecifically named in the agreements. Yet in both cases, the courts held that the defendants were\nthird-party beneficiaries with standing to enforce the agreements, because the parties to the\nagreements obviously intended to confer on them the benefit of immunity.

Ms. Maxwell supported her position with leters from her\nspouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the\ncircumstances of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s explanation that she took\nthese measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to\nharm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to\nflee.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s\nwife atempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span>\nairline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half\nmonths after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court\nalloued the government to introduce this evidence to shou the defendant’s intent to flee and to\nargue that it was proof of consciousness of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and\nhighlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian\npassport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had\nknoun for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been\ndirectly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent\nwith an intention to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam), where the court found the\njury could properly infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country\none day after the crime was commited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 425 (citing Salameh, l52 F.3d at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5697", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagelloofl4\nl57). By contrast, the Second Circuit found that the government’s evidence in A/-Sadawi was\n“too atenuated” to establish that the defendant intended to flee to avoid prosecution or\napprehension and the government should not have been permited to argue consciousness of guilt\non the basis of that evidence. /d.\n\nHere, the purported “flight” evidence is even more atenuated than in Al-Sadawi. Like\nAl-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell knew she was a subject of the government’s investigation after the\narrest of Jeffery Epstein and could have left the country at any point in the one-year period\nleading up to her arrest (nine-and-a-half months longer than Al-Sadawi). But she did not.\n\nUnlike Al-Sadawi, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ms. Maxwell was preparing to flee.\nNeither Ms. Maxwell nor her spouse had <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> a plane ticket, nor was Ms. Maxwell\nplanning to move locations. On the contrary, Ms. Maxwell had been living in the same residence\nin New Hampshire for seven months — a location she chose because it was close to her family\nand close to the prosecutors in New York in case she needed to meet with them. Moreover,\nwhen Ms. Maxwell was arrested, the arresting agents found nothing suggesting that she planned\nto abscond. Finally, unlike A/-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell proffered independent evidence supporting\nan alternative explanation for her actions that rebuts any inference that she intended to flee.\n\nHence, if it was improper for the trial court to allou the introduction of flight evidence in\nAl-Sadawi, it would be even more improper for the Court to do so here.

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\n<span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool99lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019914.jpg": "CaSade2ZOtehQd3GouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL) 26a Geagpeot 2 GP l9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them.

In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank’).

The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant.

To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span>\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit.

(Comey,\nMaurene) (Entered: ll/l2/2o2l)\n\nll/l2/2o2l | 458 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nmotion seeking clarification on two items from the November l, 2o2l pretrial\nconference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed\norder regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November l8,\n2o2l. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The leter requests anonymity on behalf\nof the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers categorically deny\nthe allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff based on the incident\nand the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no views as to whether some\nother action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either sides allegations. This\nCourts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an\nopportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-client\ncommunications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to\ntake further action at this time. After recetving the defenses first leter motion, the Court\nordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why the Court should not grant the requested\nrelief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in part defense counsels original request and\nordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain questions about the April 24, 2o2l\nincident and the procedures in place to ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells\nlawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense counsels current application is that\nthis Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of the in-person atorney-client\nvisit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels\npreservation leter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to\nview or receive copies of those materials as a mater of law, they should be provided. To\nthe extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that\napplication is denied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell has the opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in\nlight of all relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained\ninmates in BOP custody.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

(See probable cause\naffidavit at page l8). In particular, the probable cause affidavit notes that “on\nthe first floor of the Epstein residence . . . [was] found two covert cameras\nhidden in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the\nlibrary area behind Epstein’s computer. . . . the computer’s hard drive was\nreviewed which shoued several images of J and other witnesses\ninterviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera\npositioned behind Epstein’s desk”. (/d.) Omited from the Police Report and\nthe probable cause affidavit is the fact that the PBPD had knoun since 2oo3\nabout the presence of the cameras, and the specific reason for their installation.\nThe cameras were installed in 2oo3 after Epstein discovered that large sums of\ncash were missing from his home. Indeed, not only were the cameras\ninstalled at the suggestion of the PBPD, but the PBPD initially provided\nequipment that did not work and thereafter assisted in the installation of the\nequipment Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span>. The cameras ultimately served their purpose\nand captured the image of former employee Juan Alessi, removing cash from\nEpstein’s briefcase after unlawfully entering the house. The recording of\nAlessi was turned over to the PBPD — indeed, to Det. Recarey himself. The\ncharacterization of the video equipment either as a surprise to the PBPD or as\nplaying a part in the alleged sexual activity in Epstein’s home (even though\nnone of the complainants ever made any mention of such equipment, or ever\nplaced any activity in the locations of the cameras), is false and misleading\nand suggests an intention to portray the facts to suit a particular goal.\n\n4. Broken “Sex Toys” in Epstein’s Trash. The Police Report details police\nfinding in Epstein’s trash what is described as pieces of “sex toys” and that\nthese “discoveries” purportedly corroborate witness statements. Omited from\nboth the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit is the fact that during\nthe course of executing the search warrant on Epstein’s home, the police\nrealized that a key “sex toy” was in fact the broken handle of a salad server.\nThough the “sex toys” play a prominent role in the Police Report and probable\ncause affidavit, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the discovery\nof this new and highly relevant evidence.\n\n5. Failure to Consider Exculpatory or Impeaching Evidence. Other\nexculpatory and impeaching evidence knoun by the PBPD was omited from\nthe Police Report and probable cause affidavit by, in our view, manipulating\nthe date the investigation was allegedly closed. According to the Police\nReport (at page 85), Det. Recarey “explained [to ASA Belohlavek] that the\nPBPD had concluded its case in December of 2oo5”. That assertion, which is\nfalse, conveniently resulted in the omission of all information adduced\nsubsequent to that date. Thus, though the Police Report in fact contains\ninformation obtained after December 2oo5, the PBPD escaped having to\nconsider, or even to include in the Police Report, the probable cause affidavit,\nor what it released to the public, all the exculpatory and impeaching evidence\npresented on behalf of Epstein, most of which was provided after December\n2oo5. That evidence is listed belou.\n\n3 Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo332lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033213.jpg": "was employed at ie Florida.

As the manager\napproached, MMMM‘pulled out a pair of black SLT panties that had the sensor\non them”.) Seeing the manager, WM claimed “someone is trying to set me\nup”. Follouing an internal investigation, which disclosed additional thefts\nfrom both the store and a customer, she was fired. (In addition to the theft\nabove, she was seen by co-workers with store merchandise in her car; she was\nbelieved to have engaged in a fraudulent “return scheme”; and she obtained a\npair of shoes from another store in the same mall by exchanging them for a\npair of just <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> men’s shoes inadvertently left behind by a customer).\nIn a recorded interview by a Loss Prevention manager, admited to\nmerchandise theft of $2o9 [and asserted] “that her reason for stealing was that\nshe understood she was not geting paid enough and was struggling\nfinancially”.

While it might be commonplace to say that\na particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly\nreflects this fact on both financial and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is\nquick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally\nthose who work for him and those he knous. Once he learns of and determines through\nconversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,\ntreats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees\nto it that, without strings atached, the solution happens. The issues may be\naccommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family\nproblems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to beter\nhimself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to\naddress the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this\ncapacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.\n\nExamples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.\nIndyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:\n\n; Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the\nworkman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-\nin-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen\nof Colombia and the workman did not have the financial resources or\nknou hou to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey\narranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law\nand sponsored and <span class=\"highlight\">purchased</span> the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit\nto the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients\nrecovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.\nEpstein’s expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the\nhigh school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education\nis nou being funded by Mr. Epstein.\n\nThere have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for\nemployees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several\nexamples follou:\n\nA father of one of Jeffrey’s employees in the Virgin Islands was recently\ndiagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for\nthe father’s treatment and has given the employee financial support and\ncomplete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order\nto fly to Florida to atend to the employee’s father.\n\nll\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323l"};
