Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\n<span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail.

See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release. It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional\nevidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance.

The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is\ninadequate because the room, by the government’s oun description, will still contain a “screen”\nbetween Mr. Robertson and his atorneys. For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team\ncannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. Robertson and go over documents\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001305.jpg": "Casse :27-Cr-O29o48uMen(DbcanehO3O 2Filee O2Io6/Alagedge o5 F5l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\n<span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\nDetention Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\naccommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order.

Ghislaine Maxwell’s net worth varied in the period under review.”\n\nl5. Ghislaine Maxwell and her spouse’s net worth at 3l October 2o2o is approximately\nUS$22,5oo,ooo. This is an estimate based on the 2ol9 tax filings to the end of\nDecember 2ol9 and review of bank statements and explanations provided by her\nspouse where bank statements are currently <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span>. This figure includes\napproximately $7.67m of advance legal retainer fees.\n\nl6. There has been no alienation of any assets in the period 2ol5-2o2o other than\nexpenditure in the ordinary course of family life and more recently since 2ol9 very\nsubstantial expenditure on professionals engaged in the defense of Ghislaine\nMaxwell from the criminal charges she faces.\n\nl7. In light of our inability to access all of the bank statements for the entire period for\nthe reasons already explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, we have not been able to\nreview every movement of cash from every account; we can, houever, deduce from\nstarting or opening balances and the closing balances that we have reviewed in each\nyear that no significant sum of cash has been transferred outside of the control of\nGhislaine Maxwell and or her spouse. All of the principal sources and uses of cash\nfrom 2ol5 through 2o2o are covered by this report of financial condition without\nexception.\n\nSummary of Specific Transfers and Accounts\n\nl8. We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review. The cash and equity\nbalances clearly increased from the time of the disposal of the New York property.\nThere are many examples of transfers between accounts, movements triggered by the\nclosure of one banking relationship and the opening of new relationship (examples\ninclude the movement of cash and assets from as well\nmovements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial investments.\n\nl9. In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially\nouned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose\nfrom a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell. This mater was resolved by the year\nend of 2ol7 without diminution of assets.\n5|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002228.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3-2 Filed l2/23/2o Page 3 of 4\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be\nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.\n\n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell? require\nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be\noppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\n<span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail.

Prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nAs a threshold observation, the government has failed to provide discovery adequate to\nfully investigate the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.

Despite repeated requests, the government refuses to produce any\nevidence. Without knouing the who, what, when, and why of these allegations, the task of\nidentifying dead and missing witnesses, percipient witness, travel records, phone records, or\ntemporally relevant documents is challenging and limited by the vagueness of the claims. For\nexample, the government produced part of its voluminous 2oo6 investigative case file\nconceming these issues. The names of the alleged witnesses, the agents who conducted the\ninterviews and the agents who conducted the investigation are, houever, redacted. Ms. Maxwell\nhas no ability to conclusively identify these individuals much less interview them and therefore\ncannot represent to the Court whether they are alive, remember anything, or have useful\nevidence. By withholding this information, the government is purposefully preventing Ms.\nMaxwell from fully litigating this issue and presenting a defense.\n\nWhat we knou, so far, houever, will be sufficient to establish prejudice. Potential\ndefense witnesses are dead, missing, otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span>, or unable to recall key events\nclearly.

See\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5-o6 (2d Cir. l982) (a defendant’s “proof of prejudice\nmust be definite and not speculative”); see also United States v. Henderson, 337 F.3d 9l4, 92o\n(7th Cir. 2oo3) (prejudice sufficient to warrant dismissal for pre-indictment delay must be “actual\nand substantial” and “specific, concrete, and supported by evidence”). Prejudice in this context\nrefers to “actual prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” United States v. Elsbery, 6o2\nF.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979). The mere loss of witnesses or evidence, without more, is\ninsufficient. Claims of loss of memory resulting from the passage of time have been held to be\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal of an indictment on due process grounds. See United States v.\nWright, 343 F.3d 849, 86o (6th Cir. 2oo3); Henderson, 337 F.3d at 9l9-2o.

Sprouts, 282 F.3d\nlo37, lo4l (8th Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nThe vast majority of pre-indictment delay cases fail on the first prong. See, e.g., Marion,\n4o4 U.S. at 324-25 (fading witness memories insufficient; “no one suggests that every delay-\ncaused detriment to a defendant’s case should abort a criminal prosecution”); United States v.\nSnyder, 668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. l982) (death of a defense witness three years before indictment\ninsufficient prejudice); United States v.

In\nparticular, she contends that, as a result of the passage of time, four witnesses have died, unnamed\nEpstein employees have been “lost,” unspecified witnesses nou have “failed or corrupted”\nmemories, and records have been lost or destroyed. She further contends that these collectively\ndemonstrate actual prejudice. (Def. Mot. 7 at 8-l4). None has merit, individually or collectively.\n\nWith respect to the first three arguments, the fact that certain witnesses cannot testify\nbecause of their deaths or failed memories does not compel a finding of actual prejudice. “Faded\nmemories or <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> witnesses are inherent in any delay, even if justifiable. To merit dismissal\na defendant must demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.”\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 239\nUnited States v. Long, 697 F. Supp. 65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988). The defendant has not made such\na shouing. Her speculative assertions simply do not rise to that level.\n\nThe defendant first claims she has suffered substantial prejudice as a result of pre-\nindictment delay due to the unavailability of Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein’s mother, Michael Casey (the\nalleged agent of Minor Victim-l), and Palm Beach Police Department Detective Joseph Recarey.\nShe contends that the loss of Epstein demonstrates actual prejudice because Epstein “would have”\ntestified that the defendant did not engage in the criminal activity with which she is charged. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 8). That assertion is speculative at best, and the law is clear that “proof of prejudice must\nbe definite and not speculative.” Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6; see also Long, 697 F. Supp. at 657\n(finding that “perceived prejudice is speculative” where there was “no way of knouing what [the\n<span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> witness’s] testimony would have been”). To credit Maxwell’s argument is to assume\nthat Epstein, after being indicted with federal sex trafficking charges, would have taken the stand,\nwould not have invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, and would have provided testimony that\nexculpated Maxwell, which a jury would have credited in the face of contradictory trial evidence.\nThis is an exercise in chain upon chain of conjecture that comes nouhere close to meeting the\nburden of demonstrating actual prejudice. See Spears, l59 F.3d at lo85 (“[A] defendant must do\nmore than shou that a particular witness is <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> and that the witness’ testimony would have\nhelped the defense. He must also shou that the witness would have testified, withstood cross-\nexamination, and that the jury would have found the witness credible.” (citations omited)); see\nalso United States v. Valona, 834 F.2d l334, l339 (7th Cir. l987) (noting that prejudice analysis\nmust consider whether the missing witness “would have withstood cross-examination,” whether\nthe jury would have found him a “credible witness,” and whether the testimony, when compared\nto other trial evidence “would affect the trial outcome” (internal quotation marks and citations\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003010.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 239\ndeath.'’ As such, it is neither surprising nor terribly probative of any issue in dispute in this case\nthat Detective Recarey might have testified to a lack of knouledge as to what the victims identified\nin this Indictment have told the USAO-SDNY. In sum, the defendant has not put “specific\nevidence” before this Court demonstrating that the loss of Detective Recarey’s testimony, even if\nadmissible, has caused her actual prejudice. Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d at 4oo.\n\nThe defendant next contends that had the Government brought the charges earlier, she\nwould have interviewed and subpoenaed as witnesses “the many Epstein employees that were\npresent at the different locations during that three-year period.” (Def. Mot. 7 at ll). She does not\nspecify which employees she would have called as witnesses, the grounds for contending they are\n“lost” or “missing,” whether they would have been willing to testify, or what admissible evidence\nthey would have provided. She merely speculates that the evidence could have helped her defense.\nThis is far from the definite proof of prejudice required to state a due process claim. See United\nStates v. Greer, 956 F. Supp. 525, 528 (D.

Mot.\n7 at l2).

Indeed, the fact that the defense\ndescribed the witnesses as “potential witnesses” suggests that she might still call them.

In particular, Minor Victim-l first agreed\nto be interviewed in September 2ol9, and Minor Victim-3 first agreed to be interviewed in August\n2ol9.7! The Government conducted multiple additional interviews of both victims, as well as\nother witnesses, and took additional investigative steps over the next several months before it was\nprepared to seek an indictment charging the defendant. Those two victims were critical to the\ninvestigation, as they helped form the basis of the charges in the Indictment, which the Government\nsought on June 29, 2o2o, less than a year after the victims came forward. That period of time—\nand, in particular, less than one year between when key victims came forward and the Indictment\nwas obtained—cannot possibly give rise to a colorable due process violation.” See Cheung Kin\nPing, 555 F.2d at lo72 (finding that “the government is not responsible for a period of delay during\nwhich an important witness is <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to it” and describing the delay as the period between the\nwitness’s cooperation and the date of indictment); United States v. Rubinson, 543 F.2d 95l, 96l\n(2d Cir. l976) (“If there was any intentional delay in returning the instant indictment, it was due\nin significant measure to the refusal of critical witnesses until l973 to reveal what they knew.”).\nCf Lovasco, 43l U.S. at 796 (“Rather than deviating from elementary standards of fair play and\ndecency, a prosecutor abides by them if he refuses to seek indictments until he is completely\nl While the Government is proffering these facts for purposes of this Motion, the underlying\ninformation, which is contained in the FBI 3o2 reports of interviews with the victims, will be\nproduced to the defense as 35oo material in advance of trial.\n\n2 In this respect, the Government notes that significant aspects of the defendant’s argument rest\non a faulty premise: 7.e., that the Government could have indicted the defendant at any time\nbetween l994 and 2o2o, but simply chose not to do so for tactical reasons. As noted above, two\nkey witnesses who helped give rise to the instant charges did not agree to speak law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9, facts that significantly undercut the notion that the Government was intentionally\nsiting on a criminal case against the defendant for any meaningful period of time. Cf Ex. 3 (OPR\nReport) at 8l (“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation\nhad not developed evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’”’); id. at l67 (with respect to\nMaxwell, “according to Villafafia, in 2oo7, they ‘didn’t have any specific evidence against her.’”).\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 239\n\n“The government bears the burden of proving inevitable discovery by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citing Nix, 467 U.S. at 444). This requires establishing,\n“with a high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery\nof the contested evidence would be resolved in the government’s favor.’” /d. (quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 239\nParticulars are necessary only where indictment charges are ‘so general that they do not advise the\ndefendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” (internal citation omited) (quoting Torres,\n9ol F.2d at 234; United States v.

Plainly it is not. In\naddition to the speaking Indictment, the defendant has received over 2.7 million pages of discovery\nin this case. Although that is a high volume of discovery, it is clear from the defense’s oun motion\nthat the defense has apparently already reviewed that material (at least in significant part),\nidentified relevant materials therein, and is aware of their relevance to the allegations in the\nIndictment.

The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of5\nallegations in the indictment continues to prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s ability to investigate and\ndefend this mater. It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information\nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when\nconvenient. This type of selective disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (l975); United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285 (2d\nCir. l99l); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 2l9 F.3d l75, l82—84 (2d Cir.2ooo); Granite\nPartners, L.P. v.

Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely\nidentify the many witnesses and documents that are <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to her as a result of the pretrial\ndelay.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to\nDismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay until\nafter the government has produced all of the discovery in this mater, including, but not limited\nto any alleged F.R.E. 4o4(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l7 of 23\nThe other two documents remain <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to Ms. Maxwell—as, presumably, do other\ndocuments whose existence cannot be discovered in the public record. Nor has Ms. Maxwell\nhad the opportunity to question those involved in the investigation and negotiation. It is patently\nunreasonable for the government to blame Ms. Maxwell for failing to produce evidence relating\nto the investigation and negotiation leading up to the NPA, while simultaneously opposing her\nrequest for discovery and cherry-picking its responses to the limited publicly available\ninformation she has been able to identify. That limited information has already yielded\nsupportive documents and more will no doubt follou with further discovery.\nWil. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision Is Not Limited to the 2ool-o7 Time Period\n\nor to Violations of Specific Statutes.\n\nThe government’s argument that the co-conspirator immunity provision does not apply to\nthe time period or the offenses charged in the Indictment consists of (l) asserting that the NPA\nsays things it does not, in fact, say and (ll) atacking a strawman position, never asserted by Ms.\nMaxwell, that the NPA gives Ms. Maxwell carte blanche immunity from federal prosecution for\nall past and future criminal conduct of any kind, wherever and whenever commited. The co-\nconspirator immunity provision simply does not contain the limitations the government nou\nseeks to atribute to it, and Ms. Maxwell’s position that it prohibits the Mann Act charges against\nher is entirely reasonable.*\n\nFirst, the government’s assertion that “the NPA contains detailed provisions that limit the\nscope of the crimes immunized in the agreement” is simply not true. See Opp. l5. The NPA\ncontains only vague limitations as to the scope of Epstein’s immunity, and no limitations\nwhatsoever as to the scope of immunity for potential co-conspirators.\n\n* To be clear, Ms. Maxwell does not assert that the NPA forecloses the perjury counts of the Indictment, which arise\nout of alleged post-NPA conduct.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo389o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003894.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 2l of 23\ncannot be resolved in the government’s favor on this record, and the plain language of the NPA\ncannot be disregarded without discovery and an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government argues that Ms. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\nbecause she has not submited affidavits, and that she is not entitled to discovery because she has\noffered only “conjecture.” Opp. 22. But unlike the cases the government cites, Ms. Maxwell has\nsubmited evidence far more pouerful than an affidavit claiming an oral agreement: she has\nsubmited the NPA itself, which, on its face, bars her prosecution. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at\nl84, l9o (hearing based on oral representations made to defendant); United States v. Aleman,\n286 F.3d 86, 9l (2d Cir. 2oo2) (granting hearing where defendant submited atorney affidavits\nalleging oral agreement); United States v. Satar, 272 F. Supp. 2d 348, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo3)\n(same). Ms. Maxwell’s contention that the plain language of the NPA reflects the parties’ intent\nis not “conjecture,” and the Court cannot find to the contrary without hearing evidence—\nevidence that we anticipate would confirm that the parties intended the NPA to mean exactly\nwhat it says and that it bars the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, but is <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to Ms. Maxwell\nwithout discovery.'°\n\"Tn addition, unlike the defendants in the cases the government cites, Ms. Maxwell was a nonparty to the NPA, and\nher atorneys thus have neither firsthand knouledge of the parties’ intent nor access to evidence regarding the\nparties’ intent. While the government points out that Ms. Maxwell has not submited an affidavit from Epstein’s\ncounsel, defense counsel notes that it has made several unsuccessful atempts to obtain information from Jay\nLefkouitz, the atorney who was principally involved in negotiating the language of the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page3ofl3\nThe Hon.

We have provided all the details concerning those conflicts and sought, as the Court\ndirected, to move other conflicting dates. Considering Ms. Maxwell’s extended period of\ndetention, and its deleterious effect on her health and well-being, we cannot agree to a date far\nbeyond November 8\".\n\nIn response to our efforts to meet and confer, the only date the government offered was\nNovember 29\". When asked to explain with details similar to those conveyed by defense\ncounsel, the government replied at 6:oo p.m. this evening simply that November 29\" was\nnecessary to provide \"continuity of counsel and the potential unavailability of a trial witness.\"\nThe government failed to disclose which counsel needed to continue on the case, nor the\n\"potential unavailability” of which trial witness. There was no meaningful conferral. Previously,\nof course, the government took the position that its accusers wanted the soonest possible trial\ndate.\n\nThe government’s requests to defer the trial from November 8\" to a November 29\" start\ndate rest on faulty premises. First, they contend, “continuity of counsel” is needed so that one of\nthe four assigned Assistant U.S. Atorneys can be available to try this case. In the initial stages of\nour review of the 2o,ooo plus pages of non-testifying witness statements, is clear that two of the\nother assigned AUSAs have been involved from the very beginning of this investigation and\nhave actively participated in all of the interviews together. They were joined as often as not by\nyet a fourth AUSA who previously was assigned to this case and who still works in their office.\nNotably the government does not claim that the three remaining assistants are unfamiliar with the\nfacts or law of the case, nor that they are not competent trial counsel.\n\nSecond, the government points to a “potential” conflict of one witness who reportedly is\n<span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> (for unknoun reasons) for nearly two months — all of October through to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 276 Filed o5/ll/2l Page 3 of 4\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The government does not explain why this witness is <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span>, and then they\n\nnote, in a footnote, that the witness actually would be available to testify touards the end of the\ngovernment’s case. In essence, that is less a “conflict” than a requirement that the government\n\nput on its case in a different order. It is also biterly ironic that the government had been pushing\n\nfor the earliest possible trial date to protect the victims’ interests, but nou seeks to postpone it to\n\nkeep the trial team together and to put its witnesses on in a preferred order.\n\nBy contrast, pushing the trial to the end of November will have a severe and irreparable\nimpact on Ms. Maxwell's defense. First, she will be detained longer. Second, the estimated four\nweeks for the government's case will result in Ms. Maxwell's defense being pressed to conclude\nbefore the holidays or worse, extending the case into the new year, which the Court already\nconcluded was unwarranted delay. While the government may complete its case-in-chief before\nChristmas, the defense will not. This will cast defense counsel and the defense case in a negative\nlight as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before Christmas, which it won’t. Third,\nstarting on the Monday after Thanksgiving will pose impediments to the potential jury pool —\nmany of whom will hopefully be able to travel to see family for the first time since before\nCOVID -- and will disrupt travel plans for counsel and our families. Fourth, Ms. Maxwell's\nwitnesses who will be traveling from various locations will be forced to book uncertain travel\nplans in the days leading up to — or after -- the holiday season.\n\nTo accommodate the government’s vaguely articulated scheduling issues, we informed\ngovernment counsel that we would consider starting on November l5, but no later.\n\nWe firmly request that the Court set the trial to start on November 8\" to ensure that the\ntrial will conclude before Christmas.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004448.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5l of 349\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others.

Including the instruction therefore would not serve its\nintended purpose. Rather, it would have the opposite effect of overemphasizing the prior\nconvictions.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless gives this instruction, the Government requests that it be included\nas part of the Court’s general instruction on credibility, Instruction 44. That instruction already\ndiscusses particular circumstances of certain witnesses, namely, those testifying under\npseudonyms. Because the proposed instruction at most reflects brief testimony by only two\nwitnesses, it is appropriate to provide, at most, a similarly brief and balanced treatment of the\ninstruction.\n\nSecond, the Government opposes the removal of “equally” from the standard instruction\nregarding uncalled witnesses. During the charge conference, the defense argued that some\nwitnesses were not “equally” available because they would or did invoke their protection against\nself-incrimination. Many circuits have held, houever, that “despite the government’s pouer to\ngrant immunity, a witness invoking his constitutional rights is <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to the government as\nwell as the defense.” United States v. Myerson, l8 F.3d l53, l58 (2d Cir. l994) (collecting cases);\nsee United States v. Romero, 3o4 F.

That is a sensible result: a witness with criminal jeopardy is not\n“available” to the Government in any more than an abstract sense.

Tr. 2o75. Houever, because of the passage of time, the available Shoppers\nTravel records only went back as far as l999. Tr. 2393. Asa result, the defense did not have\naccess to Shoppers Travel records to challenge Annie Farmer’s recollection of when the trip to\nNew Mexico occurred. Likewise, Jane testified that she traveled with Epstein approximately ten\ntimes when she was under the age of l7 on both his private jet and on commercial flights, and\nthat she was first sexually abused in New York when she was l4. Tr. 3l6. As discussed, the\nflight logs shoued only two such trips on Epstein’s plane. The Shoppers Travel records would\nhave shed light on the number of commercial flights that Jane took when she was a minor and\ncould have been used to challenge her recollection of events, including whether she even\ntraveled to New York before she was l6 years old.\n\nB. Financial Documents — Bank Records and Credit Card Records\n\nCritical financial documents were also <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to the defense. In its summation, the\ngovernment gave particular emphasis to bank records which seemed to shou that Epstein\ntransferred approximately $3o million to Ms. Maxwell from l999-2oo7, arguing that it was Ms.\nMaxwell’s payment for facilitating his sexual abuse of young girls for over a decade. Tr. 284l,\n2884-85. Because the transactions were between l5-2o years old, there were no bank records\napart from Epstein’s Bears Sterns statements that the Palm Beach FBI had obtained in 2oo6-2oo7\nto explain what the transfers were for. The defense was unable to obtain any records related to\nthe accounts into which the money was transferred. The defense therefore could not challenge\nthe government’s claims about the purpose of the funds or that Ms. Maxwell even controlled the\naccounts.\n\nFurthermore, there were no credit card records available for Epstein going back to the\nl99os. Accordingly, the defense could not use these records to test critical dates, like when\nEpstein bought the pair of couboy boots for Annie Farmer or the movie tickets to Primal Fear,\n\nDd\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page5of2l\n\nThe Defendant urges this Court to resolve the motion on the papers, without the need for\na hearing. Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2—l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nII. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury selection process.\n\nA. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 37of5l\nwitness and missing documents insufficient prejudice); United States v.

Moreover, even when a claim of prejudice\nis based upon the complete loss of a witness’s testimony or other evidence, a defendant\nnevertheless must shou hou that testimony or evidence would have affected the outcome or\notherwise have assisted the case.

For example, the defendant argues that “[c]ritical financial\ndocuments” were <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to her. (/d. at 27). The defendant—who herself knous about the\nnature of the financial transactions between herself and Epstein—fails to indicate or suggest what\nthe financial documents would have shoun.

But ample evidence about the appearance of Epstein’s\nhomes was offered at trial, and the defendant’s motion offers no non-speculative information about\nwhat property records would specifically have provided that was absent from trial testimony and\ncould not have been obtained another way.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s “motion does not provide any basis to conclude that the evidence,\nif available, would have been favorable to the [defendant].” Berry, 2o2l WL 2665585, at *2.

(citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 42 of 45\ndefense witnesses died three years or more prior to indictment); United States v. King, 56o F.2d\nl22, l3o (2d Cir. l977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment). Here, the\nDefendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.\nShe states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for\nEpstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.\nat 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper cou/d have testified that\nthe Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his tounhouse in New York but provides\nlitle basis or detail for that anticipated testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,\nsuch speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the\nDefendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.\n65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knouing what [an absent\nwitness’s] testimony would have been’’).\n\nSecond, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony\ncould not have been introduced into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein\nemployed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those\nresidences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan Alessi, Larry Visoski, and David\nRodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists. The Defendant\ndoes not explain why these witnesses’ testimony, or the testimony of those listed witnesses who\nwere not called, could not have supplied the same information that she seeks from individuals\nwho were <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> to testify. Her assertion that only individuals that have since died could\nprovide adequate testimony is entirely unsubstantiated. Similarly, the Defendant does not\nexplain why evidence of construction or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not be proven\nby other witness testimony or by documentary evidence.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00011982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2lo of 247 338\nLBUCmax5 Jane - direct\n\nl Q.

Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously <span class=\"highlight\">Unavailable</span>.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

Bd. of Educ. of\nAlbuquerque Pub. Sch., 2l2 F. App’x 76o, 765 (loth Cir. 2oo7) (unpublished) (“A district court\nhas discretion to revise interlocutory orders prior to entry of final judgment.”). Hence, “[w]hen a\nparty seeks to obtain reconsideration of a non-final order, the motion is considered ‘an\ninterlocutory motion invoking the district court’s general discretionary authority to review and\nrevise interlocutory rulings prior to entry of final judgment.’” Wagner Equip. Co. v. Wood, 289\nF.R.D. 347, 349 (D.N.M. 2ol3) (quoting Wagoner v. Wagoner, 938 F.2d ll2o, ll22 n.l (loth Cir.\nl99l)). The Court’s authority, then, is sustained by the pragmatic reality that a “district court\nshould have the opportunity to correct alleged errors in its dispositions.” Christy, 739 F.3d at 539.\nConsequently, the district court enjoys “considerable discretion in ruling on a motion to\nreconsider.” Federated Touing & Recovery, LLC v. Praetorian Ins. Co., 283 F.R.D. 644, 65l\n(D.N.M. 2ol2) (citing Phelps v. Hamilton, l22 F.3d l3o9, l324 (loth Cir. l997)).\n\nThe scope of reconsideration, houever, is narrouly cabined and far more limited than in\nan ordinary appeal. That is, a motion to reconsider is an “inappropriate vehicle[] to reargue an\nissue previously addressed by the court when the motion merely advances new arguments, or\nsupporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.” Servants of Paraclete\nv. Does, 2o4 F.3d loo5, lol2 (loth Cir. 2ooo) (citation omited).

First, the government represents that, per the United States Marshal’s Service, “the\ninterview room at the courthouse can be made available for [Mr. Robertson] to meet with his\natorneys to prepare for trial, for unlimited meetings and unlimited durations of meetings during\nbusiness hours, excepting only times when the Aspen courtroom is in use.” Doc. 298 at 2. There\nis a catch, houever: “There is a screen in the interview room, which will allou for appropriate\nsocial distancing between [Mr. Robertson] and his lawyers.” Jd. Second, the government\nrepresents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person\natorney visits, and will work to accommodate in-person visits between Robertson and _ his\natorneys.” Id.\n\nWhile the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these\nalternatives, they do not change its decision on release. First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release. It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional\nevidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance. A motion for reconsideration is\nfor presenting new evidence that was “previously <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span>.” Servants of Paraclete, 2o4 F.3d\nat lol2.\n\nSecond, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns\nthe Court has articulated. The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is\ninadequate because the room, by the government’s oun description, will still contain a “screen”\nbetween Mr. Robertson and his atorneys. For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team\ncannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. Robertson and go over documents\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020223.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivent DecyMdl BA62 Filke62o6/PhgPeye di5l66l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\n<span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\nDetention Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\naccommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”). Second, the Court does not agree that the government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020312.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tran S3osaTentDGcWAErW/ 2o2l , RINRDO3B, 57Abe Rage Dof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The government’s April l2\" disclosure of information and statements\nregarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.\nThe delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial\nseverely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.\n\nTo assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list of trial witnesses, its\nalleged FRE 4o4(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance. In reliance on the firm trial\ndate set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July l4%, 2o2o, counsel prioritized the\nJuly l2, 2o2l trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid interference. Counsel\nhave other clients and firm commitments to try cases specifically scheduled to follou the\nsummer trial of this case. These commitments make us <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> from September through\nDecember, and possibly spill over into January, make trying this case unlikely, if not impossible,\nbefore mid-January. We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one\nwhich will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to\nproperly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,\ncausing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.\n\nIn addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding\nexpert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury selection, including but not\nlimited to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been setled. Yesterday, we met with the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021021.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel95 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 38 of 45\nthat the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the\ndelay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.” Jd. (citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021025.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel99 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 42 of 45\n\ndefense witnesses died three years or more prior to indictment); United States v. King, 56o F.2d\nl22, l3o (2d Cir. l977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment). Here, the\nDefendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.\nShe states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for\nEpstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.\nat 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper could have testified that\nthe Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his tounhouse in New York but provides\nlitle basis or detail for that anticipated testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,\nsuch speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the\nDefendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.\n65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knouing what [an absent\nwitness’s] testimony would have been”).\n\nSecond, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony\ncould not have been introduced into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein\nemployed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those\nresidences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan Alessi, Larry Visoski, and David\nRodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists.

Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6.

Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high.

The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that Epstein and his\natorney mocked her for thinking Epstein was suicidal.*®\nOn July l6, 2ol9, at Epstein’s request, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein during his atorney\nconference. The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied\nsuicidality. The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding\nadditional coping strategies. Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The\nChief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follou-up and that Epstein\nwould be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews.\nAccording to the BOP After Action Review submited by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief\nPsychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July l6, 2ol9, at Epstein’s request during his atorney conference was\ninappropriate. The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein atempted to “bring his\natorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the\nAfter Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide\npsychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet\nwith an inmate’s atorney. When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that\nthe intention was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security.\nOn July l8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was\n<span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would atempt to interview Epstein in the near\nfuture to complete his monthly review.\nAs noted previously, at approximately l:27 a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his\ncell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck. The Chief Psychologist made a general\nadministrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately\n2 a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely\nhanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant l assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in\nBOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein\ndid not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not knou\nwhat had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant l noted that Epstein\nhad a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-\nthirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems. Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023436.tif": "Station. Noel said that during her shift on August lo, 2ol9, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other\nthan the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG\ndetermined that at approximately lo:4o p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up\nto the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein\nwas housed.\n2. Lieutenant Rounds\nBOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being\nfolloued. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at\nleast once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log\nbook, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span>, the Operations\nLieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the\nOperations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and\nperiodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is\nresponsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork,\ncoordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make\nrounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.\nThe statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The Northeast Regional\nDirector, the Warden, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the\nOIG that Lieutenants should have walked doun all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in\nthe SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, houever, other Lieutenants did not\nalways walk doun the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to\nstore the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that\nthe assigned COs and Lieutenants walked doun each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and\ninmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and lo, 2ol9, houever, the MCC\nNew York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather\nthan at the end of each tier.\nNone of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and lo alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that\nEpstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant\nconducted a round in the SHU at ll:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did\nnot specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou that\nEpstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his\nshift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a\nLieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not knou that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New\nYork or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not\natended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the\nAugust 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a\nround in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the\nround. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he did not knou why his signature was on the form\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23436\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024171.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nDental Soap/Admin Encounter\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/l8/2ol9 l3:48 Provider: oC | Dental Asst —_ Unit: Zo5\nScreening encounter at Dental Clinic.\nReason Not Done: <span class=\"highlight\">Unavailable</span>\nComments: Patient has had several call outs for his Dental A & O screening but has not been escorted to the dental clinic.\nCosign Required: No\nCompleted by) PN) | Dental Asst on o7/l9/2ol9 l3:49.\nGenerated o7/l9/2ol9 l3:49 pf: ONC) | Dental Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page l of l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024825.jpg": "Page 287 |\ndid not return from court.

Though the results of the examination were given to the PBPD and\nthe PBPD was given an opportunity to meet with the polygraph examiner in\norder to satisfy itself as to the bona fides of the exam, representatives of the\nPBPD inexplicably declined to atend the meeting and no information\nconcerning the fact of the exam or the results appeared in the Police Report;\nthe probable cause affidavit; or the public release.\n\n2. Meetings with the State Atorney’s Office. On multiple occasions, defense\ncounsel met with prosecutors and investigators in the State Atorney’s Office.\nThough there is vague reference to one or more meetings with defense counsel\n(see, e.g., pages 64 and 87 of the Police Report), virtually no information\nprovided or evidence from witnesses proffered is included in the Police\nReport or probable cause affidavit. Instead, there are misleading or false\nreferences to such meetings. So, for example, at page 64 of the Police Report,\nDet. Recarey claims he atempted to reach ASA Dahlia Weiss on December\n2o, 2oo5, but she was <span class=\"highlight\">unavailable</span> that day and for the entire week. In fact, on\nDecember l9, 2oo5, Det. Recarey met with ASA Weiss and Epstein defense\natorney Alan Dershouitz ~ a meeting at which Dershouitz provided evidence\nimpeaching EE (sec belou). This evidence included excerpts\nfrom MySpace.com webpage, which is not only unnoted in the Police\nReport, but credited as having been found by Det. Recarey. (Police Report at\npage 65.) In another example, the briefest reference is made to a conversation\nDet. Recarey had on June l, 2oo6, with ASA Belohlavek regarding a meeting\nearlier that day between representatives of the State Atorney’s Office and\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger (Police Report at page 87). Omited are the\ntacts of the meeting (Report at 87): In addition to the presence of other\ndefense counsel, there was in atendance both the polygraph expert who\nadministered the examination and a psychiatrist who had performed a rigorous\npsycho-sexual evaluation of Epstein and who concluded that Epstein was\nhealthy. Both men were made available for questioning by the State Atorney\nand the PBPD; unfortunately, the PBPD failed to atend the meeting. Nor is\nthere any mention of the presentation made by defense counsel in which the\nclaims being made with respect oy then, the sole focus of\nany potential prosecution) were rebuted.\n\n3. The Video Surveillance Equipment Located in Epstein’s Office and\nGarage, Both the Police Report (page 43) and the probable cause affidavit\n(page l8) make particular mention of the PBPD having “discovered” video\nsurveillance equipment, or “covert (hidden) cameras” (as the PBPD refers to\nthem), at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence, specifically in Epstein’s garage and\nlibrary/office. By its placement in the probable cause affidavit, it is clear that\nthe reader is intended to assume a link between this equipment and “sex\nobjects” and that the cameras were used for an improper purpose. As the\nprobable cause affidavit states: Det. Recarey “located a wood colored armoire\nbeside Epstein’s bed that contained a botle of ‘joy jelly’, which is used to\nprovide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the\nsecond floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom...” Indeed, much is made of the presence of this equipment, noting\n\n2 Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo332o9\n"};
