(App.92).\n\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION\n\nThis case is the perfect vehicle for resolving an\nacknouledged circuit split over the proper application\nof this Court’s precedent regarding an important issue\nof federal criminal law. Despite the fact that the term\n“United States” has a widely accepted meaning in\nperhaps every other context, when this term is used in\na plea agreement, it means something different in\nNew Jersey than it does across the river in New York\nCity. A criminal defendant who, after receiving a\npromise that he will not be prosecuted again by the\nUnited States, pleads guilty to resolve all criminal\nliability, is not in fact resolving all criminal liability\nbecause the United States remains free to prosecute\nhim anew so long as it does so in the Second or Seventh\nCircuits.\n\nThis Court should resolve this conflict, ensuring that\nplea agreements are enforced consistently <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthe United States so that when the United States\nmakes a promise in a plea agreement, it is held to that\npromise.\n\nI. The circuits are split as to whether a promise\non behalf of the “United States” or the\n“Government” by a United States Atorney’s\noffice in one district is binding upon United\nStates Atorney’s offices in other districts.\n\nIn Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l), this\nCourt held that a prosecutor’s promise in a plea\nagreement binds other prosecutors, even those who\nmight have been unaware of the promise. 4o4 U.S.\nat 262. “Th[e] circumstances will vary, but a constant\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooooo49", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000050.jpg": "8\n\nfactor is that, when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so\nthat it can be said to be part of the inducement or\nconsideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” Jd. And\nin Giglio v. United States, this Court found that “the\nprosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the\nspokesman for the Government. A promise made by\none atorney must be atributed, for these purposes, to\nthe Government.” Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S.\nl5o, l54 (l972).\n\nYet despite this binding precedent, the Second\nCircuit refuses to hold its United States prosecutors to\nthe promises that other United States prosecutors\nhave made on behalf of the United States, instead\nclinging to the position that a plea agreement binds\nonly the district in which it was entered unless it\nexpressly states otherwise, even if the promise is made\non behalf of the “United States.” (App.8-l2). The\nSeventh Circuit similarly applies a narrou interpreta-\ntion of who is bound by a pledge on behalf of the\n“United States” or the “Government.” This policy jeop-\nardizes the integrity of the plea negotiation process\nnationwide, which is “an essential component of the\nadministration of justice” that “presupposels] fairness\nin securing agreement between an accused and a\nprosecutor.” Santobello, 4o4 U.S. at 26l.\n\nThe Second and Seventh Circuit’s policy is squarely\nin conflict with that of the Third, Fourth, Eighth and\nNinth Circuits, creating a circuit split with nationwide\nramifications pursuant to which the same plea agree-\nment can receive a different interpretation <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthe country on one of its most fundamental aspects\n(a defendant’s potential future criminal liability). This\ncase provides an ideal opportunity to resolve this\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo5o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000165.jpg": "lo2a\nCity Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein\nhad commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York filed a\nnolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment\nagainst Epstein. On August 27, 2ol9, the district court\nheld a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida\nthat was addressed through the NPA—spoke about\nthe impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the\nEpstein indictment on August 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in\nFlorida overseeing the CVRA litigation denied the\npetitioners their requested remedies and closed the\ncase as moot. Among its findings, the court concluded\nthat although the government had violated the CVRA,\nthe government had asserted “legitimate and legally\nsupportable positions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this litigation,” and\ntherefore had not litigated in bad faith. The court also\nnoted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its\nemployees about the CVRA and the proper treatment\nof crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to\nmeet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane\nDoe l” filed in her true name a petition for a writ of\nmandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Eleventh Circuit, seeking review of the district\ncourt’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In\nits responsive brief, the government argued that “as a\nmater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do\nnot atach prior to the government charging a case”\nand thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the\nSouthern District of Florida] because no criminal\ncharges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000181.jpg": "ll8a\n\nreview all of the language, but he agrees with\nit in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will\nboth be available at 2:oo. ...

Acosta replied, “I\ndon’t think I should be part of negotiations.

Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she\nhas not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain\nin the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2ol9 is\nparticularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been\neven more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press\narticles began turning the public’s atention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for\nEpstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s\ninvestigation.” Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be\nvictims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution.\nDespite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was\nredirected touard her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave\nthe country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was\narrested.

That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC.

Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision.

We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the areas in which she is moved and confined.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool43o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001435.jpg": "_ Casesb:2o-cr/ oo88olAoNnt DOctiMent 2/2o2 Filedwos/H5/PagPage Last 2\noe U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

MDC staff conduct flashlight checks\nevery 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the “SHU”) and conduct\nflashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular\nintervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nWith respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes\nbecause the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule. That is\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001448.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o). In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the pendency of this case, Judge Nathan has closely\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool448", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001450.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagelo of 24\n\nflashlight surveillance.” (Mot. Ex.Cat2). That same day, Judge Nathan directed\nthe Government to confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the District Court\nwith an explanation of what flashlight surveillance the MDC conducts on Maxwell\nat night, the basis for such surveillance, and the availability of an appropriate eye\ncovering for Maxwell’s use at night. (Dkt. 257).\n\nl9. On May 5, 2o2l, the Government submited a leter to Judge\nNathan conveying MDC legal counsel’s answers to the District Court’s questions.\n(Mot. Ex. D). First, the Government confirmed that all inmates at the MDC are\nsubject to some form of flashlight checks <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the night for their safety and\nsecurity. In particular, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell in\norder to illuminate the cell enough to confirm that each inmate “is present in the cell,\nbreathing, and not in distress.” (/d. at l). MDC staff conduct such checks every\n3o minutes in the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), and approximately once per hour\nfor inmates housed in general population. (/d.). Because Maxwell is on an\nenhanced security schedule, MDC staff conduct these nightime checks on her every\nl5 minutes. (d.). Second, the Government conveyed that the MDC has\ndetermined that, although Maxwell is not on suicide watch, increased frequency of\nnightime monitoring is warranted in her case due to several factors that “raise\nheightened safety and security concerns,” including the charges she faces, the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool45o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001452.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel2 of 24\njustifying the MDC’s decision to monitor Maxwell more frequently at night than\nother inmates. (/d.). With respect to eye coverings, Judge Nathan noted that the\nprohibition on eye masks “is a generally applicable policy,” but Maxwell is\nnevertheless permited to “use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes” at\nnight. (Ud. at 2). Judge Nathan concluded that “nothing in the record plausibly\nestablishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her\ntrial and communicate with her lawyers.” (/d.). Consistent with the atention she\nhas paid to Maxwell’s conditions of confinement <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan instructed the Government and the MDC “‘to continue to ensure\nthat Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols” that are “necessary for\nher safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent\nwith the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.” (/d.).\nARGUMENT\nMaxwell’s Motion Should Be Denied\n\n22. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s orders denying\nbail or temporary pretrial release to Maxwell and accordingly denied her motions\nseeking such relief on appeal.

Consistent with her practice <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan carefully considered Maxwell’s most recent complaint that\nnightime security checks by MDC staff interfere with her ability to prepare for trial.\nWhen Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to direct the MDC either to modify its nightime\nsurveillance procedures or to justify those procedures, Judge Nathan solicited a\nresponse from the MDC and evaluated the explanation provided. In so doing,\nJudge Nathan focused on whether the MDC implemented the contested protocol\nbased on neutral factors that justify any deviation from the ordinary practice.\n\n35. Maxwell faults Judge Nathan for not “tell[ing] the Bureau of\nPrisons what to do.” (Mot. at 2). But even assuming that it were proper for a\nDistrict Court to instruct the Bureau of Prisons regarding the details of operating a\njail, Maxwell fails to explain why it was unreasonable to conclude that an increase\nof nightime checks from the 3o-minute intervals applicable in the SHU to the l5-\nminute intervals applied to Maxwell was warranted given the specific factors that\nheighten safety and security concerns for Maxwell. Unlike most other inmates,\nMaxwell does not have a cellmate who could alert staff if she was in distress, and\nMaxwell faces very serious charges under the glare of a high-profile case, the stress\nof which increases the possibility that she may self-harm. Moreover, as Judge\nNathan noted, Maxwell offered no evidence to support the notion that those\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l7 of 26\ncases related to Epstein in the Southern District of New York and has sat for depositions in\nthose cases.

Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she\nhas not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain\nin the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2ol9 is\nparticularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been\neven more acute at that time.

The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span>\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 6 of 8\n\ne “some of the minor girls” { 2;\n\ne “multiple minor girls” { 4;\n\ne “Epstein’s minor victims” § 4a;\n\ne “a minor victim” § 4b;\n\ne “Among the victims ... were minor victims identified herein as Minor Victim-l,\nMinor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3.” § 7; and\n\ne “engaged in the follouing acts, among others, with respect to minor victims....”\nq 7.\n\nThe inconsistent and interchangeable use of seemingly defined alleged victims, i.e.,\nMinor Victim-l, with generic undefined “victims,” “minor victims”, and “girls,” prevents Ms.\nMaxwell from knouing what alleged conduct with what alleged person formed the basis of this\nIndictment and allous for multiple variances of proof at any trial.\n\nRandom acts are disbursed <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the indictment, some tied to generic alleged\n“victims” other to a defined alleged “Minor Victim:”\n\ne “befriend” § 4a;\n\ne “being present” § 7a;\n\ne “groomed” 97a;\n\ne “undressing” §[7a; and\n\ne “took Minor Victim -2 to a movie” § 7b.\n\nThe discovery provides to Ms. Maxwell provides no information about when and where\nthe alleged instances of sexual abuse took place.

THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2633", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002680.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of l6\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to\nStrike Surplusage from the Indictment (“Motion”).\n\nAlthough Ms. Maxwell is charged with conspiring to cause individuals to travel in\ninterstate or foreign commerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity, the indictment contains no\nallegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled.’ Moreover, <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the period alleged in the\nindictment, Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged conduct\nas to her took place.

The substantive Mann\nAct counts involve Ms. Maxwell’s alleged enticement and/or transportation of Accuser-l.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell engaged in group sexual encounters with\nJeffrey Epstein and Accuser-l and that, on at least one occasion, Ms. Maxwell enticed or caused\nAccuser-l to travel from Florida to New York for the purpose of engaging in such encounters\nwith Epstein.

In Bortnovsky, the Second Circuit reversed the defendants’\nconvictions for failure to grant a bill of particulars, primarily because the indictment failed to\nidentify relevant dates. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574-75. The Circuit concluded that the\ndefendants, accused of submiting false burglary claims for insurance purposes, “were hindered\nin preparing their defense by the district court’s failure to compel the Government to reveal\ncrucial information: the dates of the fake burglaries and the identity of the three fraudulent\ndocuments.” /d. at 574.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2729", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002822.jpg": "CaGade2o-rr-oo2864oAPAC DOnouraissad Fieeoa2Z2e?l Pafagect 26 2o\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nwanna nnn nnn nnn nnmmnennnnn nnn IK |\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, . :\n-V- : $3 l7 Cr. 548 (PAC) |\nJOSHUA ADAM SCHULTE, . :\ne OPINION & ORDER\nDefendant. :\n\nDefendant Joshua Adam Schulte (“Defendant” or “Schulte”) is a former employee of the |\nCentral Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) who is charged with stealing national defense information |\nfrom the CLA and transmiting it to Wikileaks.

(Schulte Br. at 2, ECF 435; Gov’t Opp. Br. at l, ECF 444.) |\nSchulte has been in custody since his arrest. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l.) :\nOn June l8, 2ol8, an indictment charged Schulte with thirteen counts of espionage and :\nother offenses. (See id.) On October 3l, 2ol8, the Government obtained a superseding\nindictment, which incorporated the same offenses as the initial indictment but added two |\nadditional counts of unlawful disclosure and criminal contempt of court. (See id. at l-2.)\nOn February 2, 2o2o, Schulte proceeded to trial on the eleven national security related\ncharges. (d. at 2.) On March 9, 2o2o, the jury returned a guilty verdict on two counts: (l) :\nmaking false statements to law enforcement, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § lool, and (2) criminal |\ncontempt of court, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 4ol(3). Ud.; Schulte Br. at 2.) The jury, houever,\nwas unable to reach a unanimous verdict with respect to the remaining eight national security\ncharges. (Schulte Br. at 2.) Accordingly, the Court granted the Defendant’s motion for a |\nmistrial on those counts. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 2.)\nImmediately follouing the trial, New York City emerged as the global epicenter of the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. See Hopkins Hawley LLC v. Cuomo, No. 2o-CV-lo932 (PAC), 2o2l WL |\n465437, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2o2l) (describing the COVID-l9 pandemic’s effects on New\nYork City).

Grand juries and jury\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2823", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002824.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouREiehd Fieeboda22e/P l Pafageok 26 2o\ntrials were not spared. See id. On June 8, 2o2o, houever, the Government sought and obtained a |\nthird superseding Indictment from a grand jury siting in the District’s White Plains courthouse. |\n(Schulte Br, at 2; Gov’t Opp. Br. at 2.) The Indictment charges Schulte with nine criminal\ncounts relating to his alleged transmission of national defense information to WikiLeaks. (ECF |\n4o5.) According to the Government, the White Plains grand jury that returned the superseding |\nIndictment was the sole grand jury empaneled at the time. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l4.) :\nIl. Motion to Dismiss\nSchulte nou moves to dismiss the Indictment on the grounds that it was unlawfully |\nobtained in violation of (l) the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause; (2) the Sixth\nAmendment’s fair cross-section requirement; and (3) the ISSA. (ECF 435.) He primarily |\ncontends that the White Plains grand jury venire—from which the Indictment was obtained—did\nnot reflect a fair cross-section of the African American and Hispanic American populations in :\nthe community. And he contends that these effects are symptomatic of the exclusionary\nprocesses that are inherent in the District’s jury selection system. Relatedly, Schulte argues that\nthe Government’s decision to seek the Indictment from White Plains was improperly made.\nIll. The District’s Jury Plan\nTo understand Schulte’s claims, it is necessary to orient ourselves to some background\nknouledge of the District’s jury selection process. Under the JSSA, each federal district court\nmust “devise and place in operation a writen plan for random selection of grand and petit\njurors.” 28 U.S.C, § l863(a). The District’s jury selection plan (“Jury Plan”), which has been in\nexistence since 2oo9, provides the blueprint for the random selection of grand and petit jurors\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the District. See Amended Plan for the Random Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (hereinafter “Jury\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2824", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002837.jpg": "CaGade2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafads 66 26 2o\nproceeded this way was because of an external force: the COVID-l9 pandemic and its |\nsubstantial curtailment of in-person proceedings <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the District. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658.\nThis allegation therefore does not establish systematic exclusion. !\nSecond, Schulte argues that the Jury Plan’s replenishment of the master wheels only once |\nevery four years constitutes systematic exclusion. (Schulte Br. at l4.) According to Schulte, the\nfour-year period causes addresses to grou “stale” as people move to new residences, and because\nAfrican Americans and Hispanic Americans are, on average, younger and thus more likely to :\nmove, he argues that these groups are systematically excluded. (See id. l4-l5.) But even\ngranting the dubious premises that make up this deductive reasoning, the Court remains ,\nunpersuaded because, again, the true cause of the exclusion—younger people moving more |\noften—is an external force, not a systematic defect inherent in the Jury Plan. Rioux, 97 F.3d at )\n658 (concluding that a jury system that led to undeliverable questionnaires did not constitute ,\nsystematic exclusion}. At botom, the Court cannot charge the District’s Jury Plan with a Sixth\nAmendment violation because of hou often people move residences <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the District.\nThird, Schulte asserts that the Jury Plan’s exclusive reliance on voter registration lists\nconstitutes systematic exclusion. This claim, houever, is foreclosed by the Second Circuit’s\ndecision in Schanbarger. See 77 F.3d at l424 (“{A] jury venire drawn from voter registration\nlists violates neither the Sixth Amendment's fair cross-section requirement nor the Fifth\nAmendment’s guarantee of Equal protection.”).\nFinally, Schulte alleges that the exclusion of “inactive voters” in certain counties within\nWhite Plains constitutes systematic exclusion because African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans are more likely to be inactive voters.

The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual\nabuse, but the legislative history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a child could not be prosecuted\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\nidentified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express intention was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 amendment extended the statute of limitations <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Broun, 8oo F. App’x 455, 46l (9th Cir. 2o2o) (2ol4 indictment charging,\namong other crimes, sex trafficking offenses dating to 2ooo and 2ool), cert. denied, No. 2o-5o64,\n-- 8.

United\nStates v. Kozel, No. l9 Cr. 46o (KMW), 2o2o WL 475l498, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Counts Two and Four, charging violations of l8 U.S.C §2422 and § 2243, respectively,\nsimilarly contain the elements of those offenses and adequately inform the defendant of the charges\n°° Alternatively, the defendant claims that the acts listed <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the Indictment do not\nconstitute illegal behavior. In this vein, the defendant makes specific reference to “grooming” as\nconduct that is not illegal. (Def. Mot. l2 at 4). The defendant cites no authority for this argument,\nwhich is contrary to Second Circuit law. In particular, the Second Circuit has for many years\nfound grooming behavior to be a means to “persuade, induce, or entice” minors to engage in illegal\nsexual activity. See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 896 F.3d l55, l73 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (“Our\nprecedent, houever, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in this context: that\ndefinition would reasonably include Thompson’s grooming of the minor victims to act as he\ndesired with regard to many maters over the months before he made the video.”); United States v.\nDorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l8o (2d Cir. 2olo) (“We do not believe that the district court was clearly\nerroneous in finding, as a mater of fact, that these images were sent as part of a grooming process\nto persuade the agent to engage in the type of sexual conduct depicted in the images.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited)); United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Brand’s sexual advances and grooming behavior provide additional evidence in support of the\njury’s finding that Brand atempted to entice a minor.”’). In any event, whether grooming alone\nconstitutes a crime is immaterial to the instant motion, and it will be for the jury to decide whether\nthe evidence at trial, as a whole, establishes the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nl56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 348\nSecretary of Labor.

Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 37 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nl. OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3226", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8l of 348\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3257", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “TI don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 348\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “‘for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules.

These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7\"\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3347", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l86 of 348\n2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7*> Although OPR found no decisive\na Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it ls clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3362", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 223 of 348\nee.

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three victims\nwere notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general\nterms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim\nnotification, and no further notifications were done. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span>\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*\"? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.7! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to observe him, Brunel and Maxwell engage in illegal\nsexual acts with dozens of underage girls.

The plain\nlanguage of the NPA states, without limitation, that “the United States .. . will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Because the Superseding\nIndictment (“Indictment”) contends that Ms. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, the NPA,\non its face, applies here. Thus, the government’s only argument, which it makes <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> its\nopposition, is that the NPA means something other than what it says.\n\nIn suggesting that the parties to the NPA intended to immunize only the four individuals\nspecifically named in the co-conspirator immunity provision, the government flagrantly ignores\nthe express statement that immunity is “not limited to” those individuals. In arguing that the\nprovision binds only the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida\n(“USAO-SDFL”), the government asks the Court to add the words “in this District” to that\nprovision, on the thin suggestion that the parties must have meant to include the same limitation\non location of prosecution that they included in Epstein’s immunity provision, even though they\nfailed to do so. And for good measure, the government asks the Court to find that the parties\nmust have intended to limit co-conspirator immunity to specific statutory offenses commited\nbetween 2ool and 2oo7, even though—again—no such limitation appears in the text of the co-\nconspirator immunity provision.\n\nNotwithstanding the bedrock principle that plea agreements are construed strictly against\nthe government, the government asks the Court to simply assume that the parties intended the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3878", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page6oflo\nPage 6\n\nparticular to the time period covered by the S2 Indictment, especially with the guidance provided\nby the Government regarding key documents relevant to Minor Victim-4. Given that the largest\nportion of the discovery in this case is text searchable, the defense will also be able to tailor any\nre-review of those materials through relevant search terms. The combination of having already\npossessed the relevant discovery for months and receiving a list of key documents should\nmeaningfully assist the defense in preparing for trial as scheduled.\n\nThe Government has also commited to providing further disclosures well in advance of\ntrial and far earlier than such productions would ordinarily be made in this District. The\nGovernment has already begun producing materials relating to witnesses whom it does not intend\nto call at trial to the defense, more than three months in advance of trial. The bulk of those\nmaterials were produced on April l3, 2o2l, and the Government intends to make additional\nproductions on a rolling basis as it continues to review its files for such materials. In this vein, the\nGovernment has produced materials, including prior witness statements, for approximately 225\nindividuals relevant to the Government’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, and\nothers. While the Government made this production with an expansive eye touard its pretrial\ndisclosures, as it has adopted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the pendency of this mater, it bears noting that a\nsignificant majority of those individuals never mentioned or knew the defendant. Indeed, the\nnumber of non-testifying witnesses who mentioned the defendant makes up a small portion of the\noverall production. That is unsurprising, given that the Government conducted a broad\ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, including crimes that did not involve this defendant.\nAccordingly, to the extent the defense claims it nou needs to investigate or interview all, or even\nthe majority of these witnesses, it is unclear hou that testimony would be relevant or admissible\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3948", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\n\nthis case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,\nyet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury questionnaire to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the pendency of this case, the\ndefense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping\nschedules while also carefully reviewing discovery and preparing for trial.

Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is\nevery reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional\nrepresentation at trial as scheduled.\n\nThird, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The\nlonger this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial\ntestimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a resolution.

The counts do not specify, houever, the dates that any of this\nalleged conduct occurred. For example, the S2 Indictment does not specify when Ms. Maxwell\n“interacted” with Accuser-4 or allegedly “recruited” her “to engage in sex acts with Epstein” or\n“enticed” her “to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts with Epstein.” (S2 Indictment J\n9d, 25a, 25b). Nor does the S2 Indictment specify when Ms. Maxwell allegedly paid Accuser-4\nor sent her gifts or called her to schedule massage appointments. (Id. ff 9d, 25c, 25d). A Bill of\nParticulars for Counts Five and Six is therefore necessary and appropriate. See Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d at 575 (Bill of Particulars warranted where “[t]he relevance of key events was shrouded in\nmystery at the commencement of and <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the trial”). /d. at 575.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed above, Ms. Maxwell has already credibly asserted that her\nprosecution on Counts Five and Six is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. (See Section II\nsupra). In order “to interpose [her] plea of double jeopardy,” Ms. Maxwell must confirm what is\napparent from the grand jury testimony of Special Agen i — that the offenses charged\nin Counts Five and Six are the same offenses that were presented to the SDFL grand jury.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons and the reasons already discussed in our previous motion\nfor a Bill of Particulars, the Court should order the government to file a Bill of Particulars\nidentifying the follouing information related to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment:\n\n(l) The dates when Ms. Maxwell allegedly met and/or interacted with\n\nAccuser-4.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 82 of 349\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lol of 349\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4399", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo9 of 349\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page llo of 349\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l78 of 349\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.

And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l87 of 349\n2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA.

She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4489", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004521.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 224 of 349\neaten, U.S. Department of Fustice\ngrate Federal Burcau of Investigation\nay FBI - West Palm Beach\nree cey Suite 5oo\noa 3o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) 833-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 278, 2oo6\nRe: Case Number: a\na\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Programas being a possible victim of a federal ‘\ncrime.

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 244 of 349\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three victims\nwere notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general\nterms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim\nnotification, and no further notifications were done. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span>\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°?! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO. See Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available\nat htp://sal5.org/stateatorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm.\n\n32l OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.\nVillafafia told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on”\nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”\n\n2l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27l of 349\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°? The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe l and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9). Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention\nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and\nto receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flou from the right to confer and were\nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”\noe? The Department’s Office of Legal Programs provided a training entitled Crime Victims’ Rights in the Federal\nSystem to the USAO on January lo, 2o2o.\n32o See In re Wild, No. l9-l3843, Petition for a Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)@B) (Sept. 3o, 2ol9).\nos Wild, Brief of the United States of America in Response to Petition for Writ of Mandamus Under the Crime\nVictims Rights Act at l4 (Oct. 3l, 2ol9). As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4568", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 288 of 349\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.o7.

Thereafter, Constand traveled from Canada to Cheltenham to meet with the\ninvestigating team in person. Because this was Constand’s first time meeting with law\nenforcement personnel, she felt nervous and uncomfortable while discussing with them\nthe intimate nature of her allegations.\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then-Montgomery County District Atorney Bruce Castor\nissued a press release informing the public that Cosby was under investigation for sexual\nassault. Sergeant Schaeffer and other law enforcement officials interviewed Cosby in\nNew York City, utilizing a writen question and answer format. Cosby was accompanied\nby his atorneys, Walter M. Phillips, Esquire, and John P. Schmit, Esquire. Cosby\nreported that Constand had come to his home at least three times during their social and\nromantic relationship. Cosby claimed that, on the night in question, Constand came to\nhis house complaining of an inability to sleep. Cosby stated that he told Constand that,\nwhen he travels, he takes Benadryl, an antihistamine, which immediately makes him\ndrousy. According to Cosby, he then handed Constand one-and-a-half Benadryl pills,\nbut did not tell her what they were.\n\nCosby recalled that, once Constand ingested the pills, they kissed and touched\neach other on the couch. Cosby admited that he touched Constand’s breasts and vagina,\nbut he insisted that she neither resisted nor told him to stop. Additionally, Cosby told the\ninvestigators that he never removed his clothing and that Constand did not touch any part\nof his body under his clothes. Cosby denied having sexual intercourse with Constand\nand disclaimed any intent to do so that night.

He acknouledged that he always\ninitiated the in-person meetings and visits to his home. He also stated that he engaged\nin consensual sexual activity with Constand on three occasions, including the January\n2oo4 incident.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the depositions, Cosby identified the pills that he provided to Constand\nin 2oo4 as Benadryl. Cosby claimed to knou the effects of Benadryl well, as he frequently\ntook two of the pills to help himself fall asleep. Thus, when Constand arrived at his house\non the night in question stressed, tense, and having difficulty sleeping, Cosby decided to\ngive her three half-pills of Benadryl to help her relax. According to Cosby, Constand took\nthe pills without asking what they were, and he did not volunteer that information to her.\n\nCosby explained that, after fifteen or twenty minutes, he suggested that they move\nfrom the kitchen to the living room, where Constand met him after going to the restroom.\nCosby testified that Constand sat next to him on the couch and they began kissing and\ntouching each other. According to Cosby, they laid together on the couch while he\ntouched her breasts and inserted his fingers into her vagina. Afterwards, Cosby told her\nto try to get some sleep, and then he went upstairs to his bedroom. He came back\ndounstairs two hours later to find Constand awake. He then escorted her to the kitchen\nwhere they had a muffin and tea.\n\nCosby was questioned about his telephone conversations with Constand’s mother.\nCosby admited that he told Constand and her mother that he would write doun the name\nof the pills that he gave her and then send it to them, but that he failed to do so. He further\nexplained that he would not admit what the pills were over the phone with Constand and\nher mother because he did not want Constand’s mother to think that he was a perverted\nold man who had drugged her daughter.

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. Houever, while “we accord\ndeference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is\nde novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omited). Indeed, it is a long-standing appellate principle\nthat, “[w]ith respect to [] inferences and deductions from facts and [] conclusions of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo486l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 62 of 8o\n\nThat is what happened in this case. There has been considerable debate over the\nlegal significance of District Atorney Castor’s publicly announced decision not to\nprosecute Cosby in 2oo5. Before the trial court, the Superior Court, and nou this Court,\nthe parties have vigorously disputed whether D.A. Castor and Cosby reached a binding\nagreement, whether D.A. Castor extended an enforceable promise, or whether any act of\nlegal significance occurred at all. There is testimony in the record that could support any\nof these conclusions. The trial court—the entity charged with sorting through those\nfacts—found that D.A. Castor made no agreement or overt promise.\n\nMuch of that debate, and the atendant factual conclusions, were based upon the\napparent absence of a formal agreement and former D.A. Castor’s various efforts to\ndefend and explain his actions ten years after the fact. As a reviewing court, we accept\nthe trial court’s conclusion that the district atorney's decision was merely an exercise of\nhis charging discretion.24 As we assess whether that decision, and the surrounding\nmA The dissent agrees—as do we —with the trial court’s conclusion that D.A. Castor’s\ndecision not to prosecute was, at its core, an exercise of the inherent charging discretion\nvested in district atorneys. See D.O. at l. But the dissent would simply end the analysis\nthere. In the dissent’s view, once a decision is deemed to fall within a prosecutor’s\ndiscretion, that decision “in no way” can bind the actions of future elected prosecutors.\nRespectfully, this perspective overlooks the verity that not all decisions are the same. As\nto routine discretionary decisions, the dissent may be correct. But as we explain\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this opinion, what occurred here was anything but routine. Here, D.A. Castor’s\nexercise of discretion was made deliberately to induce the deprivation of a fundamental\nright. The typical decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute, is not made for the purpose\nof extracting incriminating information from a suspect when there exists no other\nmechanism to do so.\n\nThe dissent would amalgamate and confine all “present exercise[s] of prosecutorial\ndiscretion” within a single, non-binding, unenforceable, and unreviewable category. /d.\nWe decline to endorse this blanket approach, as such decisions merit, and indeed require,\nindividualized evaluation. To rule otherwise would authorize, if not encourage,\nprosecutors to choose temporarily not to prosecute, obtain incriminating evidence from\nthe suspect, and then reverse course with impunity. Due process necessarily requires\nthat court officials, particularly prosecutors, be held to a higher standard. This is\nparticularly so in circumstances where the prosecutor’s decision is crafted specifically to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4874", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l5 Filed o7/3o/2l Page2of3\nCourt.

An atorney need not be of record in order to be sufficiently\n“associated” with a case as to justify application of disciplinary rules regarding extrajudicial\nstatements. Lawyers who have not filed a formal notice of appearance may still possess\ninformation that lends a perception by the public that their remarks on a pending case hold\ngreater authority. See In re Hinds, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (N.J. l982); see also People v. Butafuoco,\n599 N.Y.S.2d 4l9 (Nassau Cty. Ct. l993).\n\nSuch is the case with Mr. Markus’s role in the pending mater. As noted, Mr. Markus has\natended a proceeding in this Court, after which he spoke to the press on Ms. Maxwell’s behalf.\nHe has represented Ms. Maxwell on appeals of this Court’s pre-trial bail determinations.\nMoreover, Mr. Markus has identified himself as Ms. Maxwell’s appellate lawyer in a published\nop-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case. These facts mean that the public, which\nincludes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an authoritative source of information\nregarding the pending mater and may readily consider his remarks to be accurate and reliable.\nMr. Markus is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and\nthe Court declines to consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity\nwith respect to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule.

So I want to\n\n6 speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind.\n\n7 The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here nou, she's presumed to be innocent. She is\n\n8 presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n9 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just\nlo anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You\nll can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged with\nl2 commiting these crimes. That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government\nl3. can prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not\nl4 have to prove that she is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on\nl5 any evidence and a juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice.\nl6 The next thing is that as jurors you must follou the law as I give it to you, even if you\nl7. don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.\nl8 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in\nl9 the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in\n2o ~~ discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on\n2l +something that you might have read or heard about another case.\n22 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case.

Ms. Maxwell has reported to counsel\nand the BOP that she has been threatened by corrections officers that she will be subject to\ndiscipline if she is ever out of, or anything interferes with, the camera’s view.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subject to numerous pat searches per day, despite being completely\nisolated, during which she alleges to have been touched in a sexually inappropriate manner by\ncorrections officers on multiple occasions. She declines recreation time to avoid being searched,\nwhich has negatively impacted her physical health.

As reported by the government,\n“MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes because the defendant, while not on\nsuicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule because MDC has identified a number of\nfactors that raise heightened safety and security concerns with respect to this defendant.” (Dkt.\n27o.)

Their respective statements do not corroborate one another and\nfurther demonstrate contamination and collusion from various sources. These disclosures\nsubstantially undermine the strength of the government’s case and underscore the fact that Ms.\nMaxwell should not be detained.\n\n° The male marshal assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail on Monday was inappropriately rough with and\nthreatening to her. After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a scheduled evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of innocence and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service. I made a complaint to the U.S. Marshal and have requested that\nthis particular marshal not be assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail in the future.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others.

Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not.

The Court Should Reject the Government’s Atempts to Preview any Defense\n\nCase or Cross Examination\n\nUnless and until the prosecution has established its prima facie case, the defendant “is not\ncalled upon to determine whether to produce documents and material normally privileged. It\nimposes a price on the exercise of a constitutional right to require a pre-trial decision of the trial\ntactics which are normally determined by a defense lawyer follouing the completion of the\nprima facie case.” United States v. Fratello, 44 F.R.D. 444, 452 (S.D.N.Y. l968). Moreover, the\ndecision to prosecute someone criminally carries with it certain consequences:\n\nUnder our constitutional system, a criminal defendant—need not do anything at all\n\nto defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.\n\nRather he has an absolute, unqualified right to compel the State to investigate its\n\noun case, find its oun witnesses, prove its oun facts, and convince the jury through\n\nits oun resources. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the process the defendant has a fundamental right to\n\nremain silent, in effect challenging the State at every point to: “Prove it!”\n\nUnited States v. Wilkerson, 388 F. Supp. 3d 969, 972 (E.D. Tenn. 2ol9) (quoting Williams v.\nFlorida, 399 U.S. 78, ll2 (l97o) (Black, J., dissenting)).\n\nMuch of the government’s argument is directed at causing the defense to provide a\npreview of its strategy and the substance of defense cross examination which should be rejected\nby the Court.\n\nI. THE GOVERNMENT’S PSEUDONYM TACTIC IS UNNECESSARY,\n\nUNWORKABLE, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THIS CASE\n\nThe government proposes various false or partial names for some of the accusers and\nwitnesses.

Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 348 of 375\nSusman Fae (> FORENSIC\nRobert P.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008514.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 58 of 82\n] Instruction No. 4l: Time of Offense\n2 The Indictment alleges that certain conduct occurred on or about various dates or during\n3 various time periods.

In this case, the parties publicly filed significant pre-trial briefing, including pre-trial\nmotions and motions in /imine, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in\nmotions in limine, the parties litigated the legal contours of the testimony of the witness who\ntestified under the pseudonym Kate, as well as the circumstances of Carolyn’s identification of the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 387, 392, 397. Neither the Government nor the defendant sought\nto file such documents under seal; the defendant certainly did not claim that such documents should\nbe temporarily sealed because Government witnesses could access such filings (or news articles\nabout such filings) and accordingly tailor their trial testimony. There is no reason that the Defense\nMotion should be treated differently and litigated entirely under seal.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the public docketing of the Defense Motion will enable\nJuror 5o to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only inconsistent with the foregoing practice\nin this (like every) case, but it is also unsupported by any legal authority. (Def. Leter at 2). The\ndefendant’s reliance on cases involving pre-trial publicity is inapposite. Those cases concern the\nright to a fair ‘rial, and, in those cases, sealing is proper upon specific findings that, inter alia,\n“there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by\npublicity ....” United States v. Silver, No. l5 Cr. 93 (VEC), 2ol6 WL l572993, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. l4, 2ol6) (quotations and citations omited).

Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n?

The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 24 of 37\na part and furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, [Ms. Maxwell] and Jeffrey\nEpstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states,\nwhich [Maxwell] knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual\nabuse.”’).\n\nMs. Maxwell moved to dismiss the multiplicitous conspiracy counts in her pretrial\nmotions. (Dkt. l22, 2lo, 293). The Court, citing the Second Circuit’s holding in United States v.\nJosephburg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), found that the motion was premature because Ms.\nMaxwell had not been convicted on the conspiracy counts and, hence, was not yet in jeopardy of\nreceiving multiple punishments for the same offense. (Dkt. 2o7 at 27-28; Dkt 3l7 at 9-lo). The\nCourt denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion without prejudice, deferring the resolution of the\nmultiplicity claim until after the conclusion of the trial. Jd.\n\nThe trial is nou over, and Ms. Maxwell was convicted on all three conspiracy counts.\nThe government’s theory of prosecution and the proof elicited at trial were entirely aligned with\nthe allegations in the Indictment — that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal conspiracy\nwith Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the same\noverarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthe entire time period in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell nou faces the prospect of being punished\nmultiple times for the same offense in violation of her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAccordingly, we move the Court to impose judgement on only one of the three conspiracy\ncounts.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple\ntimes, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United\nStates v.

The government was correct that the proof at trial established, at\nmost, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell with multiple objects,\nrather than multiple independent conspiracies. An analysis of the Korfant factors confirms that\nthe three conspiracies charged in Counts One, Three, and Five are virtually identical and are\ntherefore multiplicitous.*\nl. Overlap of Participants and Time\n\nThere is no dispute that the central co-conspirators in all three charged conspiracies were\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. According to the government, Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were\n“partners in crime” who sexually exploited young girls <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the entire ten-year time period\ncharged in the Indictment. Tr. 33:7-34:l3; Tr. 2842:ll-2845:9. Epstein was the principal abuser\nand Ms. Maxwell was his “best friend and right hand” and his “closest associate and second in\ncommand.” /d. Although other participants later joined the scheme, such as Sarah Kellen,\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell were the core of the conspiracy from its inception in l994 through its\nconclusion in 2oo4. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385, 387 (2d Cir. 2ol2)\n(“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy into multiple\nconspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the\nduration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nFurthermore, the Mann Act conspiracies related to all four accusers who testified at\ntrial—Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer—and spanned the same relevant ten-year period,\nl994-2oo4. Although the sex trafficking conspiracy (Count Five) related only to Carolyn and\nlasted for a shorter time period from 2ool-2oo4, that count, which was later added to the S2\nIndictment, did not describe a separate conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it was simply a subset\n* The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments,” is inapplicable here\nbecause Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same indictment. The multifactor test,\nhouever, remains applicable.

See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669\n(“The Government cannot be permited to retry defendants on smaller and smaller conspiracies,\nwholly contained within the scope of a large conspiracy, until it finds one small enough to be\nproved to the satisfaction of a jury.” (citation omited)).\n2. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government’s charging theory in the Indictment and its presentation of the evidence\nat trial was that Epstein and Maxwell engaged in a single criminal scheme with a common\nmethod of operation to recruit and “groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity\nin multiple locations, including Epstein’s residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Indeed, in summarizing the evidence for the jury, the government\nhighlighted that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used the same “playbook” with all four of the accusers\nand argued that this common method of operation was one of the principal reasons that the jury\ncould convict Ms. Maxwell on all counts:\n\nThe second reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the same\n\nplaybook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The\n\nsimilarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are\nincredibly pouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you\n\nabout the playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n\nTr. 2848:l6-22 (emphasis added); see also Tr. 2853:l4-l6 (“The paterns you saw <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthis trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways that you knou\nthat Maxwell is guilty.”’).\n\nThe common “playbook” that the government described started by targeting vulnerable\nkids, like the four accusers, who all came from single-mother households with financial or other\nhardships. Tr. 2849:l8-285o:l7. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell then isolated the girls from their\nparents and began “grooming” them for sexual abuse by taking an interest in their lives, making\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8952", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 35 of 37\n\ne Sally Markham — Ms. Markham was a property manager hired to help run\nEpstein’s properties in the early 2ooos. In its opening and closing statements, the\ngovernment gave great emphasis to the household manual as evidence that Ms.\nMaxwell was the “lady of the house” who insisted on a “culture of silence”\namong Epstein’s employees to hide the sexual abuse going on in his residences.\nTr. 34, 2846-47. The defense believes that Ms. Markham could have testified that\nthe household manual was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual\nknoun as “the Countess,” whom Epstein brought in to “professionalize” his staff.\n\ne Lynn Fontanilla — Ms. Fontanilla was the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s 7l*\nStreet tounhouse <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the relevant time period. The defense believes she\ncould have testified that Ms. Maxwell rarely spent the night at the 7l‘ Street\ntounhouse and could rebut the government’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell was\nalways by Epstein’s side.\n\nFor these reasons and the reasons set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous submissions, the\nCourt should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due\nto prejudicial pre-indictment delay.\n\nIV. The Court Should Enter a Judgment of Acquital as to All Counts Because the\nGovernment Failed to Prove Each Element of the Charges Beyond a Reasonable\nDoubt.\n\nFollouing the close of the government’s case-in-chief, Ms. Maxwell moved the Court\nunder Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to enter a judgment of acquital as to\nall counts. Tr. 2266:4-2274:l4. The Court denied the defendant’s motion. Tr. 2274:l6.\nFollouing the close of the defense case, Ms. Maxwell reasserted her Rule 29 motion for the\nreasons initially stated. Tr. 2736:8-9. Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts that same motion and\nincorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court, in the\nalternative, (l) vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on the Mann Act counts (Counts One through\nFour) and grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a constructive\namendment and/or variance from the allegations in the Indictment, (2) enter judgment on only\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8959", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o4 _ Filed o2/l7/22 Page2of6\nof its national leadership, because of the exceptional importance and potential precedential value\nof this Court’s decision, in a case that has atracted international atention, about whether a\npotential juror’s false answers about an issue integral to any juror’s ability to be fair and impartial\nwill require a new trial. We are deeply concerned about the effect that a negative answer to this\nquestion would have, not only for the rights of the defendant in this case, but upon future\ndefendants, jurors and courts.\n\n4. NACDL is made up of members who routinely try criminal cases in federal and\nstate courts <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the United States. We knou from our experiences that the effectiveness\nof the voir dire process in eliciting truthful answers to questions designed to weed out biased or\notherwise unqualified jurors is a fundamental structural prerequisite for ensuring our clients,\noften the most vulnerable and scorned members of society, receive a fair trial. NACDL members\nhave conducted numerous voir dire examinations, including in many high-profile or sensitive\ncriminal cases.\n\n5. With the experience of its members as a guide, NACDL believes it can provide the\nCourt with additional perspective concerning the issues that have been raised in the Defendant’s\npost-verdict motion. We are seriously concerned that where a juror gives a false answer to a\nquestion that is crucially important in assessing that juror’s ability to be a fair and impartial juror,\nthe structural integrity of the trial has been lost regardless of whether the false answer was given\ndeliberately. We believe, as we will discuss, that such a conclusion is consistent with existing\ncase law.\n\n6. While a finding that the misstatement was intentional would make it even more\ncertain that such a juror had an agenda and/or was biased, it should not be required where, as\nZz\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8967", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 49 of 66\nseveral different news outlets (some of which he was likely paid for) '*, and he sat for an\ninterview as part of an hour-long “documentary” called “Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and\nthe Paedophile,” which aired on the British channel ITV.

See Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 95-96 (relying on juror’s post-trial conduct as a basis for\nconcluding juror was biased and new trial was required because juror falsely answered\nmaterial question during voir dire). Juror No. 5o’s publicity tour appears to have stopped\n(at least temporarily) only because the government publicly filed a leter asking this\nCourt to inquire into Juror No. 5o’s truthfulness and suggesting that he needed a lawyer.\nThe clear message from the government to Juror No. 5o was to stop talking. >\n\n'* Tt is common for the British press to pay for crime victims’ stories. See, e.g,\nhtps://www.mirror.co.uk/sell-my-story/; htps://trianglenews.co.uk/sell-my-story-to-the-\ndaily-mail/; htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/contactus/index.html\n\n'S Juror No. 5o was clearly enjoying his fifteen minutes of fame in early January\n2o22, giving multiple interviews in which he congratulated himself as the person who\npersuaded the other jurors to adopt his biased view of the evidence and to vote to convict\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nThe government recognized that Juror No. 5o had dug a very deep hole—a hole\nthat looked to be geting deeper. Without conferring as to either the submission of the\nleter or any redactions, the government publicly filed Docket No. 568. This leter\ncommunicated to Juror No. 5o, and the media, that Juror No. 5o had done something\nwrong, that his conduct would be subject to scrutiny, and that the conduct was serious\nenough to warrant appointment of a lawyer, free of charge if necessary.\n\nHad Ms. Maxwell been asked, she would have objected to the public filing of this\nleter, which caused Juror No. 5o to delete his social media accounts and alerted Juror\nNo. 5o that he needed to stop giving media presentations and to work on his story.\n\nThe government knous hou to file a leter under seal, and this Court’s protocol\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this case has been for the parties to file leters or pleadings under restriction\nwith a conferral and briefing as to what portion of the document should be redacted.

Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3 ll\nWg. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of harassment or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\n2. The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.!°\nl4 Tn particular, Juror 5o cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\nl5 For the reasons discussed above,\n\nSimilarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 48 of 49\n\nthe court to invoke its pouers or affect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items\nmerely passed between parties in discovery (quotations omited)). The defendant’s challenge to\nthe merits of Juror 5o’s motion to intervene ignores that the motion is a judicial document whether\nor not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition\nof the underlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is premature’’).\nAnd the defendant’s assertion that the motion is not a judicial document because it is a “discovery\nrequest” is supported only by cases addressing whether discovery materials themselves should be\ndocketed, not whether a motion for discovery can be. (See Def. Mem. at 54).\n\nAt botom, the defendant fails to credibly explain hou publicly docketing Juror 5o’s oun\nmotion to intervene will interfere with Juror 5o’s oun testimony. There is no need to litigate Juror\n5o’s motion to intervene under seal just because the Court and the parties are contemplating a\nhearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished. There is no reason that Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene should be treated differently and litigated in secret.!\n\n7l Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion (Def. Mem. at 42 n.l5), there is nothing nefarious about\nthe Government’s decision to publicly docket the leter in which it brought Juror 5o’s public\nstatements to the Court’s atention and sought an inquiry. That leter is clearly a judicial document,\nand as such must be publicly filed unless there are compelling interests for sealing, such as third-\nparty privacy interests and identifying information for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms.\nNone of those interests were implicated by this short leter, which merely recites public\ninformation and sought certain relief. And contrary to the defendant’s representation, the\nGovernment sought to confer with the defense counsel before filing the leter, but received no\nresponse, as the leter notes.

The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

Without conferring as to either the submission of the\nleter or any redactions, the government publicly filed Docket No. 568. This leter\ncommunicated to Juror No. 5o, and the media, that Juror No. 5o had done something\nwrong, that his conduct would be subject to scrutiny, and that the conduct was serious\nenough to warrant appointment of a lawyer, free of charge if necessary.\n\nHad Ms. Maxwell been asked, she would have objected to the public filing of this\nleter, which caused Juror No. 5o to delete his social media accounts and alerted Juror\nNo. 5o that he needed to stop giving media presentations and to work on his story.\n\nThe government knous hou to file a leter under seal, and this Court’s protocol\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this case has been for the parties to file leters or pleadings under restriction\nwith a conferral and briefing as to what portion of the document should be redacted.

Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3) misrepresented the status of the juror’s social media to remain on the\njury. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9745", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of harassment or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\nDn The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.'4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.’\n\n‘4 Tn particular, Juror SO cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\n'S For the reasons discussed above, the defendant has not met her burden with respect to Juror 5o’s\nvoir dire statements about his social media use and accordingly a hearing regarding such\nstatements is not warranted. Similarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9833", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009846.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 48 of 49\n\nthe court to invoke its pouers or affect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items\nmerely passed between parties in discovery (quotations omited)). The defendant’s challenge to\nthe merits of Juror 5o’s motion to intervene ignores that the motion is a judicial document whether\nor not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition\nof the underlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is premature’’).\nAnd the defendant’s assertion that the motion is not a judicial document because it is a “discovery\nrequest” is supported only by cases addressing whether discovery materials themselves should be\ndocketed, not whether a motion for discovery can be. (See Def. Mem. at 54).\n\nAt botom, the defendant fails to credibly explain hou publicly docketing Juror 5o’s oun\nmotion to intervene will interfere with Juror 5o’s oun testimony. There is no need to litigate Juror\n5o’s motion to intervene under seal just because the Court and the parties are contemplating a\nhearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished. There is no reason that Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene should be treated differently and litigated in secret.!\n\n7l Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion (Def. Mem. at 42 n.l5), there is nothing nefarious about\nthe Government’s decision to publicly docket the leter in which it brought Juror 5o’s public\nstatements to the Court’s atention and sought an inquiry. That leter is clearly a judicial document,\nand as such must be publicly filed unless there are compelling interests for sealing, such as third-\nparty privacy interests and identifying information for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms.\nNone of those interests were implicated by this short leter, which merely recites public\ninformation and sought certain relief. And contrary to the defendant’s representation, the\nGovernment sought to confer with the defense counsel before filing the leter, but received no\nresponse, as the leter notes.

To the contrary, the\ngovernment’s theory <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the case was that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal\nconspiracy with Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the\nsame overarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the entire time period alleged in the Indictment.\n\nThe government’s arguments to the jury were consistent with the proof at trial, which\nestablished, at most, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, not\nmultiple independent conspiracies. See United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279, 3o7\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“A single agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy,” but\n“multiple agreements to commit separate crimes constitute multiple conspiracies” (quoting\nUnited States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989)). Indeed, the government repeatedly\nemphasized to the jury the similarities of what occurred to the four accusers and the “common\nplaybook” that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used with each of them. (Tr. 2848) (“[Maxwell] ran\nthe same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The similarities\nbetween what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful\nevidence of the defendant’s guilt’).\n\nThe government’s current position is a l8o-degree about-face and is nothing more than\nan after-the-fact atempt to preserve as many counts of conviction as possible and avoid the\nconsequences of its oun charging theory.

(/d.) The addition of Sarah Kellen as a co-conspirator touards the end of the\nconspiracy does not create multiple conspiracies. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385,\n387 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy\ninto multiple conspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the duration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nThe government also argues that although the time period of Count Five (2ool-2oo4) was\nentirely contained within the time period of Count Three (l994-2oo4), there was no significant\ntemporal overlap because “the gravamen of the offense conduct for Count Three occurred in the\nl99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count Five took place in the 2ooos.” (Opp. at 3l).\nThat is non-sensical. Count Three charges a conspiracy lasting continuously from l994-2oo4.\nJust because three of the witnesses testified about conduct in the l99os and one of the witnesses\ntestified about conduct in the 2ooos, that does not mean that the l99os conduct was somehou\nmore important or more relevant to Count Three than the 2ooos conduct. As charged, the\nconspiracy spanned the entire time period. Hence, the temporal overlap between Count Three\nand Count Five was not “minimal,” as the government contends. (Opp. at 3l). It was complete.\nThe time period of Count Five was entirely contained within, and overlapped with, the time\nperiod of Count Three.\n\nFinally, the government disingenuously argues that the geographic scope of the two\nconspiracies did not overlap because Count Three “was focused on travel to New York,”\nwhereas Count Five “largely concerned conduct that took place in Florida.” (Opp. at 3l-32).\nHere, the government is talking out of both sides of its mouth. The government argued\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 24\novert acts alleged in Count Five could easily have been alleged in Count Three because they\nwere in furtherance of the same conspiracy. Hence, the differing overt acts do not indicate\ndifferent conspiracies. See Calderone, 982 F.2d at 48 (finding two conspiracies were\nmultiplicitous even though twenty-one overt acts listed in the second conspiracy were not listed\nin the first, because they were “all in furtherance of the broader conspiracy alleged in the first’’).\n\nD. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of\n\nInterdependence\n\nFinally, the government argues that Counts Three and Five were different conspiracies\nbecause they were “fundamentally independent schemes, with different objectives and modes of\noperation.” (Opp. at 32). In doing so, the government conveniently ignores the argument it\nmade to the jury at trial — namely, that Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer were all victims of\nthe same criminal plan to sexually exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and Ms. Maxwell\ncarried out using the same methods <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the entire course of the conspiracy. (Tr. 2848)\n(“[Maxwell] ran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls.\nThe similarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly\npouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.’’).\n\nThe government atempts to side-step this obvious inconsistency by arguing that the\nconspiracy charged in Count Three involved “groom[ing] [victims] to travel to Epstein’s\nproperties for sexual abuse,” whereas Count Five involved “paying victims for so-called\n‘massage appointments,’ where they were sexually exploited.” (Opp. at 32). But “grooming”\nand travel were not exclusive to Count Three. Carolyn testified about being progressively\nintroduced to more serious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming. (Tr. l52l-23,\nl537). She also testified that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell asked her to travel to his island. (Tr.\nl534-35). Similarly, payment and massages were not exclusive to Count Five.

No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer.

The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll—l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\nquestionnaire session.

There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.” /d. at 4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial.

Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l.

Trial Tr. at 7l4-l9. Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’\ntestimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim folloued a\nuniform “playbook.” E.g., id. at 2l84 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.\nShe manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”’), 2853 (““The paterns you\nsaw <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways\nthat you knou that Maxwell is guilty.”). And the Government emphasized the many similarities\nin the Defendant’s conduct as recounted by all four witnesses. /d. at 2848 (“The similarities\nbetween what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful\nevidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you about the playbook that Maxwell ran\nagain and again and again.”), 29ol (‘““Four women have testified at this trial about Maxwell.\nThey all describe the same woman, the same playbook.”). Carolyn was the only witness who\ntestified regarding Count Five. The Government argued that her testimony “was corroborated by\nwhat Annie and Kate and Jane told [the jury] about Maxwell and hou she operated for years.”\nId. at 288o; see also id. at 2895—96 (“Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as part of a\nbroader agreement with Epstein to provide him with underage girls for abuse.”). The\nGovernment, in short, argued that the Defendant engaged in substantially the same operations for\na decade as to all victims under both Counts Three and Five.\n\nThe Government responds that while the Defendant and Epstein continuously conspired\nto sexually abuse minor victims, their conduct beginning in 2ool evolved from developing one-\non-one relationships with their victims to include a “pyramid scheme of abuse,” by which they\nacquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “massage” appointments.

Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls .. . to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”’), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”’), 2852 (“Again and again <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page/7of77\nat the beach; and her husband, who was besieged by media coverage and had lost his employment\nand professional relationships.

At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time.

There is\nno explanation for her extraordinary conditions of confinement other than calculated efforts by the\nDOJ, BOP, MDC, and prosecutors to prevent another Epstein debacle and to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell would fill the chair vacated by Epstein’s demise.

Ms. Maxwell reported that\nin January of 2o2l, a correction officer grabbed her breast with intense pressure during a\nroutine pat search, causing her significant discomfort and pain. She reported that she often\nrefuses to go to recreation to avoid being searched, which has negatively impacted her physical\nhealth because she is unable to get fresh air or exercise. She was reportedly denied an extra\nblanket in the winter and on more than one occasion an officer took one of her blankets from\nher after her request for an extra blanket was granted. She further reported that she was not\nprovided a proper food regimen for the first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she\nwas provided with small, inadequate portions or roten food. She has reportedly lost at least\nl5 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair loss. She reported that currently,\nshe suffers from constant headaches and back pain.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subject to flashlights being shined on the ceiling of her cell in l5-minute\nintervals every night since she has been incarcerated.

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4l of 55\nhere. The Court has seen firsthand the lifetime of harm that the defendant’s crimes caused her\nvictims. It was evident on the witness stand that the victims have carried the trauma of these\ncrimes <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> their adulthood, and that the defendant’s actions have forever altered the course\nof their lives. As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, victims of child sexual abuse suffer ongoing trauma:\nWe knou that although all adverse events that occur during\nchildhood can place children at higher risk for adverse outcomes,\nwe knou that among those, child sexual abuse in particular increases\nrisk for a very, very high number of various health problems and\nmental health problems and also increases risk for the severity of\nthose problems.\n(Tr. 74l-42). That is true for all of the victims in this case.\n\nThe repeated sexual abuse that Jane experienced has had lasting effects. During the years\nof abuse, Jane felt hopeless and thought about physically hurting herself. (PSR § 38). Jane\ncontinues to struggle with the abuse. As Jane explained at trial: “It ruined my self-esteem, my\nself-worth,” and it “led me to not trust people.” (/d.). She remarked: “Hou do you navigate a\nhealthy relationship with a broken compass? I didn’t even understand what real love is supposed\nto look like.” (/d.). Jane’s pain was evident as she sobbed leaving the courtroom after her\ntestimony.\n\nIn a leter’ to the Court in connection with sentencing, Annie explained: “One of the most\npainful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my\nperceptions, and my instincts. When predators groom and then abuse or exploit children and other\nvulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust themselves.” She further\n7 The victim impact statements referenced in this submission have been provided to defense\ncounsel in accordance with the Court’s June 2l, 2o22 Order (Dkt.

I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A Guidelines sentence\nis necessary to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant\ninflicted upon her many victims.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo577", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 45of55\nfor exactly what it is: a desperate atempt to shift the blame for her oun crimes and distract from\nthe gravity of her offense conduct.\n\nIn short, the defendant has lied repeatedly about her crimes, exhibited an uter failure to\naccept responsibility, and demonstrated repeated disrespect for the law and the Court. The\ndefendant’s history and characteristics weigh in favor of a Guidelines sentence.\n\n3. The Need to Promote Respect for the Law and to Afford Adequate Deterrence\n\nThe importance of promoting respect for the law and affording adequate deterrence further\nsupports imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range. Given the magnitude, breadth, and\nsophistication of the conduct in this case, those interests are best served by a significant term of\nimprisonment. The defendant’s patern of exploitative conduct, and her lies to evade responsibility\nfor her crimes, should be met with punishment that holds her accountable for the full measure of\nher criminal conduct and the abuse and horror for which she is responsible.\n\nA Guidelines sentence would also deter those who would facilitate sexual abusers in\npositions of pouer. As the Government has emphasized <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this case, Jeffrey Epstein\ncould not have commited these crimes without the defendant. The defendant, an adult woman,\nwas able to provide a cover of respectability to Epstein that lulled the victims and their families\ninto a false sense of security. This case sends the important message that those who would conspire\nwith sexual predators will be held responsible for their significant role in these crimes.\nAccordingly, a Guidelines sentence is necessary to afford deterrence.\n\nThe lenient sentence the defendant seeks would send the message that there is one system\nof laws for the rich and pouerful, and another set for everyone else. It would also send the message\nto victims that, even if they have the courage to report their abusers and undergo the excruciating\nexperience of testifying in court, there will be no meaningful accountability. As the Probation\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 48 of 55\n\ncell into a day room for thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. In the day room, the defendant\nhad exclusive access to a telephone, a television, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys. Those conditions are a far cry from the 23-hour-per-day\nlockdoun experienced by inmates in SAMs, and indeed, a far cry from many inmates in general\npopulation during the COVID-l9 pandemic, who were often locked in their cells for significant\nperiods of time to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe defendant baselessly claims that her conditions of detention “thwart[ed] her ability to\nparticipate in and prepare her defense.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 25). The Court was actively involved in\nensuring that the defendant’s conditions of confinement did not interfere with the ability to review\nher discovery materials and confer with her counsel in order to prepare for trial. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys. Maxwell also had as much, if not more, time as any\nother MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys. She received five hours of VTC calls with\nher counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney VTC calls per week, and she had\naccess to in-person visits with her atorneys.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 49 of55\n\nAdditionally, the defendant’s atorneys had full copies of her discovery and were able to\nreview all discovery material with her during their ample time for atorney visits both by VTC and\nin person. The Government also took numerous steps to address the defendant’s complaints about\nunreadable files within her discovery, including by providing a laptop (in addition to the BOP-\nprovided desktop computer) on which to review her discovery, providing new copies of discovery,\nand conferring with defense counsel regarding specific files the defendant had difficulty viewing.\nAs the Government has previously informed the Court in response to the defendant’s allegations\nregarding her emails, legal counsel for the MDC has conveyed that per BOP policy, all inmate\nemails are routinely purged every six months. In response to complaints from the defense\nregarding prematurely deleted emails, MDC staff examined the defendant’s inmate email account.\nAccording to legal counsel for the MDC, that examination revealed that the defendant had herself\ndeleted some of her emails and had archived others, but it revealed no evidence to suggest that\nMDC staff deleted any of the defendant’s emails. As the Government has previously informed the\nCourt in response to the defendant’s complaints about delivery of mail, Maxwell’s legal mail was\nprocessed and delivered to her in the same manner as mail for other inmates at the MDC.

At botom, the defendant does not like jail. But the defendant’s experiences at\nthe MDC come nouhere near justifying a dounward variance from the Guidelines range.\n\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told blatant lies about her conditions\nof confinement. She repeatedly claims to have suffered significant hair loss, but anyone who has\nseen the defendant in court can easily see that is not true. She repeatedly claims to have lost an\nextreme amount of weight, but, as noted above, BOP medical records make clear that she has not.\nThe defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> trial, she was visibly\nengaged in her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> each stage\nof the trial.

Financial Penalties\n\nIn addition to a Guidelines sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits\nthat the Court should impose the maximum fine allouable under statute. Because each of the three\ncounts of conviction carries a maximum fine of $25o,ooo, the maximum total allouable is\n$75o,ooo. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the\ndefendant, but it nevertheless sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish\ncriminal activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money\ncan undo the harm that the defendant’s crimes have done, but given the defendant’s substantial\nmeans, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is\ncertainly warranted in this case.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo587", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Pagelooflol lo\nM6SOmaxl\n\nl Carolyn credibly testified that she was paid twice as\n2 much when she brought friends to the massages.

EVERDELL: Your Honor, the fact that Jeffrey\n\n7 Epstein may have had schoolgirl costumes in 2ol9, l5 years\n\n8 after the conspiracy, is not probative of anything in this\n\n9 case.

After that, I'll\n\n6 discuss the charges in this case, and then I'll address some of\n7 the arguments the defense has made to you <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this\n\n8 trial.\n\n9 So let's start with the eight reasons that you knou\n\nlo Maxwell is guilty.\n\nll The first reason that you knou Maxwell knew exactly\n\nl2 what she was doing when she recruited and groomed young girls\nl3 for abuse is that Maxwell and Epstein were partners. They were\nl4 partners in crime who sexually exploited young girls together.\nl5 So let's talk about the relationship between Maxwell and\n\nl6 Epstein and hou it shous you that Maxwell commited these\n\nl7 crimes together with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nl8 The evidence at this trial shoued you that Maxwell was\nl9 Jeffrey Epstein's right hand. For many years they were in a\n2o romantic relationship; they were partners. In 2oo2, Maxwell\n2l wrote this essay; it's Government Exhibit 422. Nou, you knou\n22 that Maxwell wrote this essay because you saw the metadata that\n23 shoued that the author of this document was G. Max, the\n24 defendant. And the document was on a computer that was\n25 registered to Maxwell. Here's that metadata.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool44o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo of 257 2843\nLCKVMAX2 Summations —- Ms. Moe\n\nl So in this essay, here's hou Maxwell described her\n\n2 relationship with Jeffrey Epstein: Jeffrey and Ghislaine have\n3 been together, a couple, for the last eleven years. They are,\n4 contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost\n\n5 always see them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine comolement\n\n6 each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the\n\n7 other. On top of being great partners, they are also the best\n8 of friends.\n\n9 A couple for eleven years. Great partners. Rarely\n\nlo apart. Best of friends. Does that sound like a personal\n\nll assistant compartmentalized from Jeffrey Epstein's life? Of\n\nl2 course not. What Maxwell described in this essay is the\n\nl3 relationship that you heard <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this entire trial.\n\nl4 Close partners who operated together. And, ladies and\n\nl5 gentlemen, when you're with someone for eleven years, you knou\nl6 what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to\n\nl7 touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.\n\nl8 Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole\n\nl9 scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone. A single\n2o middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch,\n2l to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets\n22 off alarm bells. But when that man is accompanied by a posh,\n23 smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman, that's when\n24 everything starts to seem legitimate.

They were\nl4 partners in crime who sexually exploited young girls together.\nl5 So let's talk about the relationship between Maxwell and\n\nl6 Epstein and hou it shous you that Maxwell commited these\n\nl7 crimes together with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nl8 The evidence at this trial shoued you that Maxwell was\nl9 Jeffrey Epstein's right hand. For many years they were in a\n2o romantic relationship; they were partners. In 2oo2, Maxwell\n2l wrote this essay; it's Government Exhibit 422. Nou, you knou\n22 that Maxwell wrote this essay because you saw the metadata that\n23 shoued that the author of this document was G. Max, the\n24 defendant.

They are,\n4 contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost\n\n5 always see them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine comolement\n\n6 each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the\n\n7 other. On top of being great partners, they are also the best\n8 of friends.\n\n9 A couple for eleven years. Great partners. Rarely\n\nlo apart. Best of friends.

And, ladies and\n\nl5 gentlemen, when you're with someone for eleven years, you knou\nl6 what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to\n\nl7 touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.\n\nl8 Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole\n\nl9 scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone. A single\n2o middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch,\n2l to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets\n22 off alarm bells.

Indeed, on July 7, 2ol9, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached\nout to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and\nmaintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest.\n\nThe government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent\ninternational travel” in the last three years (Gov.

Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain\nin the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2ol9 is\nparticularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been\neven more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press\narticles began turning the public’s atention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for\nEpstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s\ninvestigation.” Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be\nvictims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution.\nDespite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was\nredirected touard her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave\nthe country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was\narrested.

The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020094.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGANnt DEctIMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBataf 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span>\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020205.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8; Co68osAeIN 3D6cOrhernit 453l , Bled 52ol G/ahe Pagef l Ob 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\n<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020265.jpg": "CaSeade2Zol ep QO3SBOvAUNt BQutren2BB 2hile@ l2/OA/ 26a cragef ZF 2\ninmates are breathing and not in distress.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020353.jpg": "_ CaSede2oteb®d33ouAannt Bey Mierit/27@2 lFiks@ BSio5/2ag Plage Lot 2\noe U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. No.\n257). The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court’s\nOrder, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.\n\nMDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a mater of course <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the facility\nfor the safety and security of the inmates at the institution. During these flashlight checks, MDC\nstaff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that\nthe inmate is present in the cell, breathing, and not in distress. MDC staff conduct flashlight checks\nevery 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the “SHU”) and conduct\nflashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular\nintervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nWith respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes\nbecause the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule. That is\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020366.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o). In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the pendency of this case, Judge Nathan has closely\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o366", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020368.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagelo of 24\n\nflashlight surveillance.” (Mot. Ex.Cat2). That same day, Judge Nathan directed\nthe Government to confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the District Court\nwith an explanation of what flashlight surveillance the MDC conducts on Maxwell\nat night, the basis for such surveillance, and the availability of an appropriate eye\ncovering for Maxwell’s use at night. (Dkt. 257).\n\nl9. On May 5, 2o2l, the Government submited a leter to Judge\nNathan conveying MDC legal counsel’s answers to the District Court’s questions.\n(Mot. Ex. D). First, the Government confirmed that all inmates at the MDC are\nsubject to some form of flashlight checks <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the night for their safety and\nsecurity. In particular, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell in\norder to illuminate the cell enough to confirm that each inmate “is present in the cell,\nbreathing, and not in distress.” (/d. at l). MDC staff conduct such checks every\n3o minutes in the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), and approximately once per hour\nfor inmates housed in general population. (/d.). Because Maxwell is on an\nenhanced security schedule, MDC staff conduct these nightime checks on her every\nl5 minutes. (d.). Second, the Government conveyed that the MDC has\ndetermined that, although Maxwell is not on suicide watch, increased frequency of\nnightime monitoring is warranted in her case due to several factors that “raise\nheightened safety and security concerns,” including the charges she faces, the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020370.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel2 of 24\njustifying the MDC’s decision to monitor Maxwell more frequently at night than\nother inmates. (/d.). With respect to eye coverings, Judge Nathan noted that the\nprohibition on eye masks “is a generally applicable policy,” but Maxwell is\nnevertheless permited to “use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes” at\nnight. (Ud. at 2). Judge Nathan concluded that “nothing in the record plausibly\nestablishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her\ntrial and communicate with her lawyers.” (/d.). Consistent with the atention she\nhas paid to Maxwell’s conditions of confinement <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan instructed the Government and the MDC “‘to continue to ensure\nthat Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols” that are “necessary for\nher safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent\nwith the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.” (/d.).\nARGUMENT\nMaxwell’s Motion Should Be Denied\n\n22. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s orders denying\nbail or temporary pretrial release to Maxwell and accordingly denied her motions\nseeking such relief on appeal.

Consistent with her practice <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan carefully considered Maxwell’s most recent complaint that\nnightime security checks by MDC staff interfere with her ability to prepare for trial.\nWhen Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to direct the MDC either to modify its nightime\nsurveillance procedures or to justify those procedures, Judge Nathan solicited a\nresponse from the MDC and evaluated the explanation provided. In so doing,\nJudge Nathan focused on whether the MDC implemented the contested protocol\nbased on neutral factors that justify any deviation from the ordinary practice.\n\n35. Maxwell faults Judge Nathan for not “tell[ing] the Bureau of\nPrisons what to do.” (Mot. at 2). But even assuming that it were proper for a\nDistrict Court to instruct the Bureau of Prisons regarding the details of operating a\njail, Maxwell fails to explain why it was unreasonable to conclude that an increase\nof nightime checks from the 3o-minute intervals applicable in the SHU to the l5-\nminute intervals applied to Maxwell was warranted given the specific factors that\nheighten safety and security concerns for Maxwell. Unlike most other inmates,\nMaxwell does not have a cellmate who could alert staff if she was in distress, and\nMaxwell faces very serious charges under the glare of a high-profile case, the stress\nof which increases the possibility that she may self-harm.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o962", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020965.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel39 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\n\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (‘Tm also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o965", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020981.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel55 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll-l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\nquestionnaire session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> trial. There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.” Jd. at4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial. Voir Dire\nTr. at l28-3l. Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l. The Court confirmed that Juror 5o “carefully” folloued the Court’s instructions during voir\ndire and trial.

Trial Tr. at 7l4-l9. Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’\ntestimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim folloued a\nuniform “playbook.” H.g., id. at 2l84 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.\nShe manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”), 2853 (“The paterns you\nsaw <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways\nthat you knou that Maxwell is guilty.”). And the Government emphasized the many similarities\nin the Defendant’s conduct as recounted by all four witnesses. /d. at 2848 (“The similarities\nbetween what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful\nevidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you about the playbook that Maxwell ran\nagain and again and again.”), 29ol (“Four women have testified at this trial about Maxwell.\nThey all describe the same woman, the same playbook.”). Carolyn was the only witness who\ntestified regarding Count Five. The Government argued that her testimony “was corroborated by\nwhat Annie and Kate and Jane told [the jury] about Maxwell and hou she operated for years.”\nId. at 288o; see also id. at 2895-96 (“Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as part of a\nbroader agreement with Epstein to provide him with underage girls for abuse.”). The\nGovernment, in short, argued that the Defendant engaged in substantially the same operations for\na decade as to all victims under both Counts Three and Five.\n\nThe Government responds that while the Defendant and Epstein continuously conspired\nto sexually abuse minor victims, their conduct beginning in 2ool evolved from developing one-\non-one relationships with their victims to include a “pyramid scheme of abuse,” by which they\nacquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “massage” appointments. Gov. Br. at 32\n(quoting Trial Tr. at 4o). To be sure, the Government in both its opening statement and its\nclosing arguments explained that the Defendant and Epstein’s abuse “evolved over the course of\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o994", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020995.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel69 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase.

Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls . .. to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”), 2852 (“Again and again <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o995", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021083.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page36 of ll3\n(“promises made by an [AUSA]” in a plea agreement “bind all agents of the\nUnited States government”); Thomas v.

Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll8l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021211.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page39 of 258\nSA-37\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 37 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021224.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N5o 3536o38, Paged2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\n\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*° According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafafia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021255.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8l 3536o38, Page83 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8l of 348\n\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed.\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\nag The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l255", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021274.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON loo. 3536o38, Pagelo2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: ‘This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”\"'? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\n9 As noted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[glood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021282.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo8 3536o38, Pagello of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021283.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo9 3536o38, Pagell of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 348\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case... simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [MJarie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021345.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel73 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\n\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].””°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.7'©\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021351.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel79 of 258\nSA-l77\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\n\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\n\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\n\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\n\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021360.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARG 3536o38, Pagel88 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l86 of 348\n2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “‘a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.”*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\noo Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021397.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page225 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 223 of 348\nie U.S. Department of Fustice\nSir Federal Bureau of Investigation\nel : i i FBI - West Palm Beach\nae pl Suite 3oo\nba 5o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) §33-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 28, 2oo6\nRe: Cate Neriter\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Program as being a possible victim of a federal\ncrime.

Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights.

And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021417.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 343 3536o38, Page245 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\n\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\n\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 387 3536o39, Page33 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S.

According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\n“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468.

To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its\ndatabases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked\ncabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These\nsearches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data\nand physical evidence.\n\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos\nof victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand dounloaded videos\nand images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography. Teams of agents, analysts,\natorneys, and privacy and civil liberties experts combed through the digital and documentary\nevidence with the aim of providing as much information as possible to the public while\nsimultaneously protecting victims. Much of the material is subject to court-ordered sealing. Only\na fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal\nserved only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of\nillegal wrongdoing. Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those\nmaterials and will not permit the release of child pornography.\n\nThis systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.”” There was also no credible\nevidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o49", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023062.jpg": "disagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023112.jpg": "and had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023120.jpg": "At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023121.jpg": "Lefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023175.jpg": "agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM 8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules.

These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023183.jpg": "and guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!>\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims ....\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023189.jpg": "[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.

And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span>\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.*”? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2s The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023198.jpg": "2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7*° Although OPR found no decisive\n238 Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l98", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023203.jpg": "With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear.

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.””* She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023255.jpg": "informed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\n\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater].

The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?!

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘<span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy.

MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the period of his detention at\nMCC New York.

The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023435.jpg": "Fi 5.2 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that\ngure 5.\nNoel filled out the round sheet on behalf of everyone who was\nworking in the SHU during his shift.

Noel saw that Epstein was in the cell\nby himself and without a cellmate, but she maintained that she did not knou that Epstein was required to\nhave a cellmate. Noel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately l5 feet away from the SHU Officers’\n“| Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute rounds\nwere conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023448.jpg": "Chapter 6: The Availability of Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nDue to the Security Camera Recording System Failure\nIn August 2ol9, the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York) had\napproximately l5o video security cameras (no audio) placed <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the institution. The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) found that approximately ll cameras were located in and around the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August lo, 2ol9, including one at\nthe end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that shoued any movement in or out of inmate cells and in\nthe Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live\nvideo feeds. Follouing Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\ninvestigators atempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the\nsecurity cameras were working and transmiting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the\nSHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29,\n2ol9, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier. As a result, while the L Tier video camera\nwas transmiting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of August lo, 2ol9, the video\nwas not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and lo was a\ncamera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of\nthe common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to\nthe different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or atempting to enter the L Tier from\nthe common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and lo, would have been picked up by the video\nrecorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings shoued the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU\nstaff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from\nEpstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.\n|. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York\nAll video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR)\nsystem. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR l” and “DVR 2,” and each\nconsisted of l6 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York's security\ncameras were assigned to record to DVR l, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras\nassigned to DVR l only recorded to the DVR l hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to\nthe DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be\nretrieved from DVR l, and vice versa.\nThe OIG's investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2ol9, the\nElectronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the\nOIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2ol6, he found that the facility's security camera system\nneeded to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly\nmaintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be\nreplaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23448", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023451.jpg": "the SIS Lieutenant assumed that the Electronics Technician would remain at the institution after his shift\nended that day to correct the issue. The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some\nmiscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that\nsame evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening. The Electronics Technician told\nthe OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the institution to begin work on the problem that\nsame day.\nThe SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were\ndoun, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the institution before the malfunction was discovered.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on\nAugust lo when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident. Associate Warden l confirmed she\nwas with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she\nonly knew video could not be replayed. She did not knou the recording system for certain cameras was\ndoun. She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording.\nAccording to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2ol9, and atended to other\nmaters <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the replacement hard drives and\natempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day. Houever, the Electronics Technician told the OIG\nthat no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was\nlocated, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, Correctional\nOfficer (CO) 4.° According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO\n4's shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the\nElectronics Technician performed the work. According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be\nat the institution the follouing day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the\nElectronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the follouing day. The Electronics Technician\nsaid his decision was influenced by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors\nthat such maters did not have to be atended to until the follouing day, and even if he had replaced the\nhard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore\nnot have finished until the follouing day anyway.\nC. SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August lo\nThe Electronics Technician arrived at the institution around 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, and shortly\nthereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he\nreported to the SHU to assist. Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in\nand around the SHU. The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the\nSHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2. While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video\nstreams on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard\ndrive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2ol9. Among the cameras whose video\nwas not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed.\n52 The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the institution's SIS unit, staff\nassigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians.\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023936.jpg": "RE: counsel having difficulty meeting with client\nron LT c says)\nTo |\nDate 2ol9/o7/o7 l7:36\nSubject: RE: counsel having difficulty meeting with client\nAtachments: TEXT .htm, Mime.822\nWith apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last\nnight and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment\ntomorrou.

Many of\n7 the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n7 of l8 commits @ felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberio Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was |\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. Cr WES ym yt =\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. 7c it al\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere is no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\nhtn-/ww_orinthi s.clickahilitv eomivalent antennae Pena That Pantaciee de Reco Request Noy A aeRRe\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031426.jpg": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nAgency ORI# FLO 5oo6oo\nDuring the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein’s home located at\n\n358 E] Bnillo Way in Palm Beach.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell] spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years, Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” teft in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. gy WES yom nit -\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. Four {\"\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. <span class=\"highlight\">Throughout</span> his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro Jevel it mevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere ts no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach.

Though the results of the examination were given to the PBPD and\nthe PBPD was given an opportunity to meet with the polygraph examiner in\norder to satisfy itself as to the bona fides of the exam, representatives of the\nPBPD inexplicably declined to atend the meeting and no information\nconcerning the fact of the exam or the results appeared in the Police Report;\nthe probable cause affidavit; or the public release.\n\n2s Meetings with the State Atorney’s Office. On multiple occasions, defense\ncounsel met with prosecutors and investigators in the State Atomney’s Office.\nThough there is vague reference to one or more meetings with defense counsel\n(see, e.g., pages 64 and 87 of the Police Report), virtually no information\nprovided or evidence from witnesses proffered is included in the Police\nReport or probable cause affidavit. Instead, there are misleading or false\nreferences to such meetings. So, for example, at page 64 of the Police Report,\nDet. Recarey claims he atempted to reach ASA Dahlia Weiss on December\n2o, 2oo5, but she was unavailable that day and for the entire week. In fact, on\nDecember l9, 2oo5, Det. Recarey met with ASA Weiss and Epstein defense\natorney Alan Dershouitz ~ a meeting at which Dershouitz provided evidence\nimpeaching (sec belou). This evidence included excerpts\nfrom MySpace.com webpage, which is not only unnoted in the Police\nReport, but credited as having been found by Det. Recarey. (Police Report at\npage 65.) In another example, the briefest reference is made to a conversation\nDet. Recarey had on June l, 2oo6, with ASA Belohlavek regarding a meeting\nearlier that day between representatives of the State Atorney’s Office and\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger (Police Report at page 87). Omited are the\ntacts of the meeting (Report at 87): In addition to the presence of other\ndefense counsel, there was in atendance both the polygraph expert who\nadministered the examination and a psychiatrist who had performed a rigorous\npsycho-sexual evaluation of Epstein and who concluded that Epstein was\nhealthy. Both men were made available for questioning by the State Atorney\nand the PBPD; unfortunately, the PBPD failed to atend the meeting. Nor is\nthere any mention of the presentation made by defense counsel in which the\nclaims being made with respect a oy then, the sole focus of\nany potential prosecution) were rebuted.\n\n3. The Video Surveillance Equipment Located in Epstein’s Office and\nGarage, Both the Police Report (page 43) and the probable cause affidavit\n(page l8) make particular mention of the PBPD having “discovered” video\nsurveillance equipment, or “covert (hidden) cameras” (as the PBPD refers to\nthem), at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence, specifically in Epstein’s garage and\nlibrary/office. By its placement in the probable cause affidavit, it is clear that\nthe reader is intended to assume a link between this equipment and “sex\nobjects” and that the cameras were used for an improper purpose. As the\nprobable cause affidavit states: Det. Recarey “located a wood colored armoire\nbeside Epstein’s bed that contained a botle of ‘joy jelly’, which is used to\nprovide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located <span class=\"highlight\">throughout</span> the\nsecond floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom...” Indeed, much is made of the presence of this equipment, noting\n\n2 Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo332o9"};
