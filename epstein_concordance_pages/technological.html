Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 6\nindictment, severance of counts, disclosure of expert testimony, disclosure of materials to\npotential experts, F.R.E. 7o2 challenges to experts, and various motions in limine. Without\nsubstantive discovery Ms. Maxwell cannot be prepared to advance or meet any of these maters.\nThe Government Has Not Complied with Its Discovery Obligations to Ms. Maxwell in the\nMDC.\n\nSeting aside what the Government has not produced, the discovery that it has produced\nto Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been incomplete and portions are still unreadable. On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had completed its first three discovery productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible <span class=\"highlight\">technological</span> solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\ndiscovery materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of discovery materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production.

In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office.

Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. As that court explained:\nThe role of the federal courts in law enforcement, exemplified by\nthe Federal Criminal Code (Title l8, USC) and in enforcing Grand\nJury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information\navailable to enforcement authorities absent a countervailing\nshouing that the need for the information for such purposes is\noutweighed by the need for protecting expectations of\nconfidentiality under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).\nId. at 94 (citing United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 42l-22 (2d Cir. l983) (finding that the\n“conflict between protection of private material used in a civil proceeding and public need in a\ncriminal prosecution” posed in that case was “easily resolved” and explaining that “[a]bsent\napplicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no\nshiled protects the civil evidence” in that case “from compellable production before the grand jury\nwhich subpoenaed it”). The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun. Id.\nChemical Bank further described the types of interests that otherwise might be implicated\nin connection with a Rule 26(c) protective order, none of which are implicated here. Jd. at 94\n(“There is no indication that any difficult balancing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) would have been\nnecessary of interests of law enforcement against protection of <span class=\"highlight\">technological</span> trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals, since no such information has been claimed to have been contained in any of\nthe discovery materials in this case.”) (citations omited).!\n' Notably, here, and in contrast to other cases further described belou, the Government’s specific\nknouledge of the subject mater of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential\nnature of the Litigation; houever, the Protective Order itself indicates that discovery materials\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo848\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6of6\n\nPage 6\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (describing such materials a “<span class=\"highlight\">technological</span> trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals”). Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to among the gravest\ncriminal offenses it investigates—the sexual exploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,\nwould tend to inculpate and/or embarrass some parties to the Protective Order. Indeed, by the very\nterms of the Protective Order, the confidential materials appear to be of the category for which\n“Ta]voiding embarrassment . . . is not by itself a valid reason for courts to uphold confidentiality\nas against a legitimate law enforcement need for the information.” J/d.; see also Prot. Order at 2\n(designating as “confidential” only information that is “confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of” the plaintiff and defendant”). “Aside from those restrictions\n[laid doun by the Fourth or Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes], hiding possible criminal\nviolations from law enforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\nconfidentiality.” Chemical Bank, l5 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nFinally, this is unlike a case in which the contours of the civil litigation are publicly\napparent. Cf Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the\nbankruptcy examination in that case “was made available to the public”). In Subpoena Duces\nTecum, for example, not only was the government apparently unconcerned with the confidentiality\nof the grand jury investigation, but the government knew from a lengthy public report precisely\nwhat it might replicate through a grand jury investigation. /d.

As that court explained:\nThe role of the federal courts in law enforcement, exemplified by\nthe Federal Criminal Code (Title l8, USC) and in enforcing Grand\nJury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information\navailable to enforcement authorities absent a countervailing\nshouing that the need for the information for such purposes is\noutweighed by the need for protecting expectations of\nconfidentiality under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).\nId. at 94 (citing United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 42l-22 (2d Cir. l983) (finding that the\n“conflict between protection of private material used in a civil proceeding and public need in a\ncriminal prosecution” posed in that case was “easily resolved” and explaining that “[a]bsent\napplicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no\nshiled protects the civil evidence” in that case “from compellable production before the grand jury\nwhich subpoenaed it”). The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun. Id.\nChemical Bank further described the types of interests that otherwise might be implicated\nin connection with a Rule 26(c) protective order, none of which are implicated here. Jd. at 94\n(“There is no indication that any difficult balancing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) would have been\nnecessary of interests of law enforcement against protection of <span class=\"highlight\">technological</span> trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals, since no such information has been claimed to have been contained in any of\nthe discovery materials in this case.”) (citations omited).!\n' Notably, here, and in contrast to other cases further described belou, the Government’s specific\nknouledge of the subject mater of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential\nnature of the Litigation; houever, the Protective Order itself indicates that discovery materials\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo355l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6of6\n\nPage 6\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (describing such materials a “<span class=\"highlight\">technological</span> trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals”). Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to among the gravest\ncriminal offenses it investigates—the sexual exploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,\nwould tend to inculpate and/or embarrass some parties to the Protective Order. Indeed, by the very\nterms of the Protective Order, the confidential materials appear to be of the category for which\n“Ta]voiding embarrassment . . . is not by itself a valid reason for courts to uphold confidentiality\nas against a legitimate law enforcement need for the information.” J/d.; see also Prot. Order at 2\n(designating as “confidential” information “whose public release would violate common law and\nstatutory privacy interests”). “Aside from those restrictions [laid doun by the Fourth or Fifth\nAmendment or applicable statutes], hiding possible criminal violations from law enforcement\nauthorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of confidentiality.” Chemical Bank, l5 F.R.D.\nat 94,\n\nFinally, this is unlike a case in which the contours of the civil litigation are publicly\napparent. Cf Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the\nbankruptcy examination in that case “was made available to the public”). In Subpoena Duces\nTecum, for example, not only was the government apparently unconcerned with the confidentiality\nof the grand jury investigation, but the government knew from a lengthy public report precisely\nwhat it might replicate through a grand jury investigation. /d. Not so with respect to the Litigation,\nwhich resulted in no such report, no trial, and limited public filings.\n\nFor all of these reasons, and for the reasons set forth in the Application, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court grant the Application.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nGEQ@FFREY S.

At no point did the\ndefendant seek relief from the protective order. Id. When the other party to the protective order |\nlearned of the defendant’s blatant disregard of its obligations, it moved for sanctions in the civil |\naction. Id.\nThe district court condemned the defendant’s behavior as “entirely unnecessary and |\ninappropriate,” but nonetheless refused to sanction the defendant—apparently because, had the |\ndefendant sought relief from that order, the judge would have granted its request. Jd. at 93-94, |\nWhile the Martindell factors were never mentioned expressly by the district court, Judge |\nBroderick observed that the confidentiality order did not implicate “<span class=\"highlight\">technological</span> trade secrets, |\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which |\ncould benefit rivals”—factors that, if present, he would have had more difficulty balancing |\nagainst the investigative needs of law enforcement. Id. at 94. |\nThere are three reasons why Chemical Bank does not justify this Court’s refusing to |\napply the Martindell factors to the Government’s application. First and foremost, the opinion of ,\nanother district judge does not trump an opinion from the Second Circuit. Second, while a reader |\nof Chemical Bank cannot be certain whether the district court complied with Martindell, the |\n|\nlanguage quoted above certainly suggests that the district court engaged in the balancing exercise |\nthat Martindell contemplated.
