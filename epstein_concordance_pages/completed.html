The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997). These documents\nDaily Mail, “French prosecutors probing Jeffrey Epstein over rape and abuse of children in Paris widen probe to\ninclude Ghislaine Maxwell to see if British socialite was involved in his offending,” (Oct. 25, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-88 7882 5/French-prosecutors-probing-Jeffrey-Epstein-widen-probe-\ninclude-Ghislaine-Maxwell html.\n\n° The defense has not yet <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its review of the over l.2 million documents produced on November 9, 2o2o\nand November l8, 2o2o.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset.

But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later.

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Court\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooool438", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001439.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/ooBBGAGANt B6eumMeEnt 2222 FiledqOS/O7/Pag Page Rast 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool439", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l2 Filed o7/o8/2o Page l of l\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n—————— x\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, .\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nV.\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, NOTICE OF APPEARANCE\nDefendant.\n————————— x\nTo the Clerk of this Court and all parties of record:\n\nPLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the undersigned hereby appears for purposes of\narraignment, initial appearance and a bail hearing only (until final retainage issues are <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>)\nas counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell in the above-captioned action.

Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 6 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Without\nsubstantive discovery Ms. Maxwell cannot be prepared to advance or meet any of these maters.\nThe Government Has Not Complied with Its Discovery Obligations to Ms. Maxwell in the\nMDC.\n\nSeting aside what the Government has not produced, the discovery that it has produced\nto Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been incomplete and portions are still unreadable. On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its first three discovery productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\ndiscovery materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of discovery materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001818.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page l of 4\neS U.S. Department of Justice\nwe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request an extension of the deadline for\nthe production of a subset of the electronic discovery in the above-referenced case from November\n9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o. This extension is necessary solely to allou adequate time for an\noutside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from electronic devices seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein for production. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense\nconditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no connection to the delay in discovery\nand no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the\nextension to produce electronic discovery to November 23, 2o2o.\n\nTo date, the Government has produced more than 35o,ooo pages of discovery to the\ndefense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth\nproduction by the existing November 9, 2o2o deadline, as detailed belou. Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final production of electronic discovery. By way of background, that final\nproduction comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law.

Additionally, as a result of the\nwork being <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> by the vendor, these materials will be produced to the defense in a manner\nthat is readily sortable and searchable which should facilitate and expedite its review.\n\nThe Government therefore respectfully requests that the Court extend the deadline for\nproduction of documents being prepared by an outside vendor to November 23, 2o2o, and that the\nCourt similarly extend the motions schedule in this case by three weeks as requested by the\ndefense.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nActing United States Atorney\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCe: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n‘Tn particular, the application in support of the July 2o2o warrant included quotations from four\nemails extracted from the devices, and, as noted, the Government will produce all four of those\ndocuments to the defense by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool82l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 629 Filed ll/o6/2o Page l of 4\n\nSe U.S. Department of Justice\n\noe United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Because Counts One through Four charge Ms.\nMaxwell with offenses that were <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> no later than l997, and because the indictment was\nnot returned until July 2o2o, these counts are time-barred unless “otherwise expressly provided\nby law.” Id.\n\nFor two independent reasons, § 3283, on which the government relies (see Government’s\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (““Gov. Mem.”), Dkt. No. 4, (filed Jul. 2, 2o2o), at 5),\ndoes not save Counts One through Four. First, under the version of § 3283 that was in effect at\nthe time of the alleged offenses, the limitations period expired when the accuser reached the age\nof 25, which indisputably occurred many years ago here. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While\nCongress amended the statute in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period to “during the life of the\nchild,” see Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of\n2oo3 (PROTECT Act) (the “2oo3 Amendment”), PL lo8-2l, April 3o, 2oo3, § 2o2, ll7 Stat.\n65o, 66o, that amendment cannot apply to conduct that occurred during the l99os. Second, by\nits plain terms, § 3283 applies only to offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. But the sexual or physical abuse or kidnaping of a\nchild is not an element of any of the offenses charged here. Accordingly, § 3283—regardless of\nwhich version is considered—simply does not apply.\n\nI. The 2oo3 Amendment Does Not Apply Retroactively.\nAt the time of the alleged offenses, § 3283 provided as follous:\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2657", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002659.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 25\nthe law.” Bouen v. Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988). This presumption\nagainst retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal\ncontext. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis. Regarding step one, not only did Congress fail to include an express\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2659", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v. Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since the time of the\nalleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost or\ndestroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively\napplying the 2oo3 Amendment here not only would fly in the face of congressional intent; it\nwould violate all notions of fundamental fairness.°\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\n° In Weingarten, the court stated that if the defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the trial court that the\n2oo3 Amendment could not retroactively extend the statute of limitations for live charges, the trial court’s holding\nwould have been in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 4 of 9\nl.

MOE: Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we\ndo not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment.\nId.\n\nBased on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July l2, 2o2l trial date and her\nlawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date.\nIt was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government\nbelatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The\ntiming suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial\nmotions and government concern about the nou-apparent weakness of its case. The government\nmay be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and\nrelied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel’s readiness for trial and\nMs. Maxwell’s prolonged detention.\n\nThis is no longer the “two-week” trial as represented by the government.

Due to travel constraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-l9 pandemic,\nthe Government was unable to travel to meet with Minor Victim-4, who resides more than a day’s\ndrive away from New York, until January 2o2l. The Government then conducted multiple in-\nperson interviews with Minor Victim-4, which concluded near the end of January 2o2l. Over the\nnext two months, the Government worked expeditiously to conduct additional investigation to\ncorroborate Minor Victim-4, including by interviewing additional witnesses, reviewing documents\nthat had already been produced to the defense in discovery, and subpoenaing additional records,\nwhich the Government promptly produced to the defense upon receipt.

But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell.

No such intent is manifest in either the text or in Senator Leahy’s statement.\n\nThe reach of Section 3283 is clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the statute\nof limitations to pre-enactment conduct, the Court should resolve its analysis at Landgraf step one\nand apply the statute as Congress intended. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—at worst—\nambiguous. Ifthe Court takes that view, it should proceed to Landgraf step two.\n\n2s The 2oo3 Amendment Satisfies Step Two of Landgraf\n\nIf the Court were to determine that the legislative intent behind Section 3283 is ambiguous,\nthe inquiry then extends to the second step of the Landgraf analysis, which examines the\nretroactive effects of the statute. As the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf, “[a] statute does\nnot operate ‘retrospectively’ merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating\nthe statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations based in prior law.” 5ll U.S. at 269. Instead, the\nquestion is whether the statute “would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a\nparty’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>.” Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995)\n(quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o). Applying Section 3283 here would have none of those\neffects. Maxwell’s rights, liabilities, and duties were governed by the substantive criminal statutes\ngoverning her conduct. Until the statute of limitations expired, Maxwell had the same legal\nliability, the same rights, and the same incentives to retain evidence. A statute extending that\nperiod ataches no new legal consequences; rather, it preserves the status quo. Therefore, the\nstatute does not operate “retrospectively” within the meaning of Landgraf.

(Def. Mot. 6). The motion is\nbaseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor\nvictims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately\ntransported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct;\nthere is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. Although Minor Victim-\n3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged\nconspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged conspiracy can\nencompass otherwise time-barred acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003122.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 239\n\nSs Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion to strike should be denied—or at a minimum deferred until after\nthe conclusion of the Government’s direct case—because all of the challenged allegations pertain\nto evidence that will be relevant and admissible at trial, and are not unduly prejudicial.\n\nFirst, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are properly included in the Indictment’s\ndescription of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three because evidence of those\nincidents is relevant and admissible at trial as direct evidence of the crimes charged. Counts One\nand Three allege that the defendant participated in conspiracies with Epstein both to transport\nminor victims and to entice minor victims to travel with the intent to commit illegal sex acts.\nIndictment Jf 9-ll, l5-l7. In the course and as part of those conspiracies, the defendant groomed\nmultiple minor victims for sexual abuse by Epstein through multiple methods, including\nbefriending victims and encouraging minor victims to provide massages to Epstein knouing he\nwould engage in sex acts with them. /d. 94 l, 4,7, l4. As detailed in the Indictment, that grooming\nwas a fundamental part of both conspiracies because it encouraged minor victims to be alone with\nand to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Jd. JJ l, 4, l4. It follous that the defendant’s role grooming\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein was a part of and therefore constitutes evidence\nof these conspiracies. /d. | 7(c), ll(d), l7(d).\n\nThe defense claims that because the Indictment does not allege that each element of\nsubstantive violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a) was met as to Minor Victim-3, her\nexperiences cannot be direct evidence of the conspiracies to violate those statutes charged in\nCounts One and Three. But that argument ignores a fundamental tenet of conspiracy law. It is\naxiomatic that a conspiracy does not require a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> substantive crime. See Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997) (“It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be punished\nwhether or not the substantive crime ensures, for the conspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the\n\nl6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 239\nthese interviews constitute witness statements covered by the Jencks Act and are not subject to\ndisclosure by statute until after each witness has <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> direct examination at trial. See l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo. As noted above, houever, the Government fully intends to provide all Jencks Act\nmaterial of both testifying and non-testifying witnesses, which will of course include the records\nrelating to these interviews, to the defense multiple weeks in advance of trial. The Government\nrespectfully submits that is sufficient to meet its obligations with respect to these documents, and\nthe defendant’s motion for their immediate disclosure should be denied.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s request for an unredacted copy of the FBI report atached to the\nDefense Motion as Exhibit C should be denied as moot because the Government has already\nproduced an unredacted copy of that report to the defense.

In other words, defense counsel has received two copies of this same document: the\nredacted version that Epstein had on one of his devices, and the unredacted version from the FBI’s\nfiles.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l6 of 239\naware, consistent with the Rule 5(f) Brady order previously issued by the Court in this case. See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); Dkt. No. 68. The Government recognizes its continuing obligation to\ndisclose any Brady material, and to make a diligent search for any relevant material that may be\nin the possession of the prosecution team, including investigating agents and officers. As the\nGovernment has already emphasized in this case, the Government takes its disclosure obligations\nvery seriously and has commited to being transparent with the Court and the defense regarding its\napproach to obtaining and reviewing files, including other agency files, that may be relevant to\nthis case. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated October 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63). Consistent with that\ncommitment, the Government has <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> an initial review of its files for Brady material and\nRule l6 material and has produced more than 2.7 million pages of discovery as a result of that\nreview. These productions have included specific disclosures of certain witness statements that\nmay arguably be exculpatory. The Government also intends to produce all statements and potential\nimpeachment material in its possession regarding any potential witness identified during its\ninvestigation, including those individuals whom the Government does not intend to call at trial.\nAs discussed belou, the Government is in the process of reviewing all files in its possession for\npotential impeachment material. The Government remains cognizant of its Brady obligations and\nwill promptly produce any potentially exculpatory material if any is identified during that review.\n\nThe Government is not currently aware of any undisclosed Brady material in its possession,\nbut it will certainly provide timely disclosure of any additional Brady material if any such material\ncomes to light. Courts in this Circuit routinely deny specific requests for Brady material where,\nas here, the Government has made a good-faith representation to the court and defense counsel\nthat it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations under Brady.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims.

In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 348\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'*’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] .... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo332o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3374", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.>!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief’ to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3438", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary.

As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged conspiracy by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the discretion to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than sufficient time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially estimated that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury selection and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4).

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Court\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 272 Filed o5/o7/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pageloofl4\nconduct involving Accuser-3 was an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy, it argues that it is\nentitled to imply that the conduct itself was unlawful. The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\nconspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a conspiracy\ndoes not require a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\ndemonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “subjective\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any relevance whatsoever to an alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that relevance certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters. The\ngovernment’s intention to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 349\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l34 of 349\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l35 of 349\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®’ Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4432", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l37 of 349\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l45 of 349\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'®* By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4442", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 239 of 349\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24l of 349\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 263 of 349\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°7 In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 293 of 349\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent— Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo Filed o6/l5/2l Page l2 of 32 8\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl got involved in as many programs as she could to make sure that\n\n2 she was preparing herself for when she got released.\n\n3 I think as soon as she got arrested and as soon as she\n\n4 got detained and as soon as she was at MCC, she realized that\n\na it's time to start making herself a beter person.

The questionnaire will explain the estimated\nschedule more fully and you will get to that in a moment.\n\nBut first, I want to tell you a litle bit about the case. As I mentioned, this is a criminal\ncase. The charges against the Defendant are set forth in an indictment. An indictment is a\nformal method of accusing someone of a crime. It is not evidence of any kind. It is the\nGovernment’s burden at trial to establish a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis case is brought by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to\nengage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms.\nMaxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must\nfind that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNou, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press\ncoverage of this trial. Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that\nis OK. But from this moment on, I instruct you that you are not to read or watch or listen to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo53l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 367 Filed lo/22/2l Page5of35\nJuror ID:\nDo (did) you supervise other people?

Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant investigative steps were <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant.

United States,\n353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)).\n\nIn its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s motion to strike, the government argued that because a\nconspiracy “does not require a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> substantive crime,” Accuser-3’s allegations could still\nbe admited as direct proof of the charged conspiracies even though she did not travel as a minor\nor engage in illegal sex acts because Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” her to engage in those\nsex acts. Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l6l-l63 (citing Salinas v.\nUnited States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997)). That argument misses the mark. While it is true that a\nconspiracy does not require a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> substantive crime, Salinas itself states that “[a]\nconspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, would satisfy all of the\nelements of a substantive criminal offense.” Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65. As to Accuser-3, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> endeavor—i.e., her alleged sex acts with Epstein—was not a substantive criminal\noffense. Even if we accept her allegations as true (which we do not), there is nothing unlawful\nabout encouraging an adult to engage in entirely lawful sex acts. Hence, Accuser-3’s allegations\nare not direct proof of the charged conspiracies regardless of whether Ms. Maxwell allegedly\n“sroomed” her (which she did not).\n\nThe Court should not admit Accuser-3’s allegations as intrinsic proof of the charged\nconspiracies either.

See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nSeparate and apart from the Court’s prior ruling, the government has not established a\nsufficient connection between the alleged false statements and the alleged sex abuse offenses to\nintroduce the statements as evidence of concealment of the later. The alleged false statements\nwere made at unrelated civil depositions in 2ol6, over 2o years after the conduct underlying the\nMann Act offenses supposedly took place, at a time when Ms. Maxwell was not under\ninvestigation. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell was never a subject of the Palm Beach FBI investigation\nthat concluded in 2oo8 and was not named as a co-conspirator in Epstein’s Non-Prosecution\nAgreement that resolved that investigation. Hence, there is no sound basis to assert that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements to conceal her involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the superseding indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell’s purported\nfalse statements were the result of an agreement with Epstein to conceal their alleged conduct or\nwere otherwise part of, or an object of, the conspiracies charged in the non-perjury counts.\nInstead, the superseding indictment alleges that the purported false statements were part of a\nseparate and independent effort by Ms. Maxwell to conceal her alleged involvement in Epstein’s\nsex abuse offenses long after those offenses had already been <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. Accordingly, the\nstatements are not sufficiently connected to the non-perjury counts to allou this evidence to be\nintroduced as proof of concealment of those offenses. See United States v. Marcus Schloss &\nCo., Inc., 7lo F.

Evidence that Robinson was in the prostitution business and controlled\nprostitutes other than Jane Doe was therefore ‘necessary to complete the story of the crime on\ntrial.’”).\n\nThe defense focuses on allegations involving Minor Victim-3 in isolation. In its atempt\nto confuse the issues, the defense argues that the defendant’s conduct with Minor Victim-3 was\nlawful in the United Kingdom, and that Minor Victim-3 was an adult when she ultimately traveled\nto the United States and was abused by Epstein. The defense states that “[a]s to [Minor Victim-\n3], the <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> endeavor—i.e., her alleged sex acts with Epstein—was not a substantive criminal\noffense.” (Def. Mot. 4 at 8 (emphasis in original)).

But the harms to the business would be directly and proximately\ncaused by actions taken in furtherance of the scheme, qualifying the business as a victim. So too\nhere.\n\nIt is no answer to say, as the defense has argued, that Epstein’s conduct with respect to\nMinor Victim-3 was legal. For the purposes of seting forth the elements of the charged crime, the\nCourt must of course draw a clear line at the age of consent.” But the definition in the CVRA and\nVWPA “‘is certainly broad,” Batista, 575 F.3d at 23l, and is broader than the elements of the\noffense. Thus, in assessing whether Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under these definitions—and in\nassessing the admissibility of her testimony—such a clear line is neither required nor proper.\nEpstein and the defendant were not checking victims’ identifications at the door to ensure they\nwere above the age of consent in whichever location they were at the time. Just as Epstein’s\nprurient interest in girls did not switch off at midnight of their l7\" birthday, neither did it toggle\non and off as his plane crossed into jurisdictions with different ages of consent. Rather, Epstein\nand the defendant were engaged in a wide-ranging conspiracy to recruit girls for sexual abuse in\nmultiple jurisdictions with differing ages of consent. The core of the conspiracy was the agreement\nto engage in the criminal conduct, and it does not mater whether the elements of the substantive\ncrimes of transportation or enticement were <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> or atempted to be <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> as to Minor\nVictim-3. See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997). That is why Epstein’s abuse of\nMinor Victim-3 is properly included in the indictment and why Epstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-\n3’s testimony is direct evidence of the conspiracy. If Minor Victim-3 was directly and proximately\n* It bears noting that the Mann Act contemplates that children under the age of l8 are victims of\nthe offense, though in this case that is limited by the New York object charged in the Indictment.\nSee, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (criminalizing the transportation of an individual “who has not\natained the age of l8” for purposes of illegal sexual activity).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7434", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 497 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page3ofll\n\nl does present a defense case, the defense witnesses will testify, and the government\n\n2 will have the opportunity to cross-examine them.\n\n3 After the presentation of evidence is <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, the parties will deliver their\n\n4 closing arguments to summarize and interpret the evidence.

Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently surmounts Rule 9ol’s “minimal” bar. The\nDefense’s objection on authentication grounds is accordingly overruled.\n\nThe Court also overrules the Defense’s objection on hearsay grounds. The directory does\nnot constitute hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth that the names listed identify a\nparticular individual or that the phone numbers listed next to the names are correct. The Second\nCircuit has affirmed the admission of documents that provide names and contact information for\nthe non-hearsay purpose of linking the individual that possessed that document to that name or\nphone number, rather than for the truth of that contact information. For example, in United\nStates v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39 (2d Cir. 2oo8), the defense objected on hearsay grounds to\nthe admission of two address books that belonged to mujahidin fighters that listed the\ndefendant’s name and a phone number. On appeal, the Second Circuit held that the address\nbooks were not hearsay because they were not admited to establish that the phone number next\nto defendant’s name “was, in fact, his phone number.” /d. at l76. Rather, it was relevant alone\nthat his “name and contact information appeared in the address books of two men identified as\nmujahidin fighters.” Jd.\n\nIn an analogous line of cases, the Second Circuit has regularly admited for non-hearsay\npurposes documents that contain a name for the fact that a person claiming to have that name\ntook a particular action. For example, in United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 373 (2d\nCir. 2oo6), the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of Western Union wire receipts to prove\nthat a person that claimed to have the defendant’s name <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> wire orders. The Government\nalso admited other circumstantial evidence to permit the jury to infer that the receipts were\n“linked to” the defendant. /d. at 374; see also United States v. Zapata, 356 F.

Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4.

Nov.\nl8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and impartial. See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial.

Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009176.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihtfexwellD@ceays erie fick Deminced had dhe Wad A2predatdr ADpay Riad fOntihe\nISEMENT a “=e\n< v <a\nf 2 : | \\ 4\ni ' |\n; { he , J\nEXCLUSIVE: ARE 'ITCHING TO [\nGET THEIR HANDS ON’ CHARLISE —\nMUTTEN'S STEPDAD - BUT FRIEND INSISTS\nLegal experts said that if David failed to disclose his past experiences before the jury deliberations, Maxwell could\nhave grounds to claim a mistrial and have her convictions quashed.\nHouever, the question of whether a potential juror was a victim of sexual abuse or a relative or friend of a victim\nwas asked in the 5o-question survey <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> by each juror ahead of selection.\nDavid said he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty' and viewing the\nvictims with a skeptical eye.\nBut, he said, 'After all I've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein. | don't want to call her a monster, but a predator is\nthe right word.\n‘She knew what was happening.

Parse in particular was charged with\na conspiracy to the defraud the IRS, to commit tax evasion, and to commit mail and wire fraud\n(Count One), as well as three counts of tax evasion relating to the tax shelter transactions of three\nseparate tax shelter clients (Counts Seventeen, Eighteen, and Nineteen).

As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn connection with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels.

The Court will release Juror 5o’s questionnaire\n\nThis Court previously reserved ruling on Juror 5o’s request that the Court release his jury\nquestionnaire to counsel, but that the document otherwise remain under seal to protect his\nsupposed privacy interest. See Dkt. No. 596 at 5 n.l. The Defendant opposes both the unsealing\nand releasing the questionnaire to counsel, arguing that “advance disclosure . . . will\nundoubt[edly] color Juror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible\nposture.” Maxwell Br. at 53. The Government argues that there is no legitimate interest in\nlimiting Juror 5o’s access and opposes maintaining the questionnaire under seal. Gov. Br. at 42;\nsee also Dkt. No. 594.\n\nThe Court will provide Juror 5o a copy of his <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> questionnaire. Unlike the\nparties’ proposed questions, Juror 5o’s access to his <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> questionnaire—the answers to\nwhich he wrote—will not undermine the integrity of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern that\nadvance disclosure may somehou taint Juror 5o’s testimony is unfounded. See United States v.\nMcCoy et al., No. l4-CR-6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329, at l5 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2ol7) (providing\nthe jury questionnaire to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing). Rather, delaying disclosure\nuntil the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.\n\nMoreover, the Court concludes that the presumption of access dictates that the\nquestionnaire must be docketed. Juror 5o’s and the Defendant’s request that the questionnaire\nremain sealed is governed by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009855.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MasihfexwellD @Ceays evitlefind Beminced kad die Wha A2predatdr ADpay Rad fone\nISEMENT a “=e\n< v <a\nf 2 : | \\ 4\ni ' |\n; { he , J\nEXCLUSIVE: ARE ‘ITCHING  @\nGET THEIR HANDS ON’ CHARLISE —\nMUTTEN'S STEPDAD - BUT FRIEND INSISTS\nLegal experts said that if David failed to disclose his past experiences before the jury deliberations, Maxwell could\nhave grounds to claim a mistrial and have her convictions quashed.\nHouever, the question of whether a potential juror was a victim of sexual abuse or a relative or friend of a victim\nwas asked in the 5o-question survey <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> by each juror ahead of selection.\nDavid said he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty' and viewing the\nvictims with a skeptical eye.\nBut, he said, 'After all I've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein. | don't want to call her a monster, but a predator is\nthe right word.\n‘She knew what was happening.

Juror\n5o testified under oath that he made an “[iJnadvertent mistake,” “one of the biggest mistakes [he\nhas] ever made in [his] life.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:23-24). On this record, the defendant cannot\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nIn particular, at the hearing, Juror 5o acknouledged that he inaccurately answered Question\n48 of the writen questionnaire, which asked prospective jurors whether they themselves or any\nfriends or family members had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault.\nJuror 5o explained that he “didn’t see the part [of Question 48] where it says self, I just—I\ncompletely skimmed way too fast.” (/d. at l4:lo-ll; see also id. at l4:23-l5:2).

July 24, 2ol4).\nJuror 5o’s description of the process of completing the questionnaire on November 4, 2o2l\ncredibly explained hou he came to make unintentional mistakes on the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he arrived at the courthouse early, waited 45 minutes to get through the security line,\nand then sat in the courthouse for hours before the Court’s video with instructions on the\nquestionnaire was played successfully. (Ud. at l2:4-6, l4:lo-l9). He explained that by the time\nhe was answering the later questions in the questionnaire, such as Question 48, he was “super\ndistracted” because of his proximity to the table where prospective jurors were dropping off their\nquestionnaires and “all the noise going on around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking\nMcDonough’s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further, the\ndefendant suggests that Shaoul is inconsistent with United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir.\nl993), which—the defendant says—held that deliberateness is not required on prong one. She\ntherefore argues that, as the earlier decision, Langford controls rather than Shaoul. (Dkt. No. 644\nat l2-l3). But as Shaoul itself explained, it is not inconsistent with Langford; rather, the\ndefendant’s reading of Langford is incorrect. 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo295", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page 9ofl6\nQuestion 49 was not precisely accurate, as he freely acknouledged at the hearing. But, as he\nexplained, at the time he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the questionnaire, it did not occur to him that his oun abuse\nrequired an affirmative answer. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at ll:25). And when asked during the hearing,\nhis initial answer reflected an honest and reasonable understanding of the question: he answered\nno because he did not consider his former stepbrother, who he never considered to be part of his\nfamily, as a family member. See United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo4) (“Would a reasonable juror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to\nhim?’”), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273 (2d Cir. 2oo6). It was only once the Court focused his atention on\nthe literal meaning of the question that he realized a different answer was accurate. Juror 5o’s\nanswers on this score bespeak a lack of linguistic precision, not a lack of credibility.\n\nJurors can and do make mistakes, and a defendant is entitled to fairness, not perfection.\nSee McDonough, 464 U.S. at 553-55 (“This Court has long held that [a litigant] is entitled to a fair\ntrial but not a perfect one, for there are no perfect trials. .. . To invalidate the result of a three-\nweek trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist on\nsomething closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.” (alteration in\noriginal, internal quotation marks omited)). It is clear that Juror 5o made a mistake from a failure\nto be careful, and not a desire to get on the jury. Juror 5o repeatedly and consistently testified\nunder oath that he did not try to get on the jury. In response to questioning by the Court, Juror 5o\nexplained, without hesitation, that he “did not hope to be on this jury” and that he “did not set out\nin order to get on this jury.”?

To the\ncontrary, that comment demonstrates Juror 5o’s candor at the hearing. Juror 5o said that ifhe had\nto serve jury duty, this case was “something interesting” when compared to more boring cases.\n(Id. at 44:8-ll; see id. at 44:6 (“So not everybody gets called for jury duty.”)).

The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22.

Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his background,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions.

In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process. Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. &\nOrder, at 7.\n\nD. Evidentiary Hearing\n\nThe hearing took place on March 8, 2o22. Juror 5o appeared with retained counsel and\ntestified pursuant to a grant of immunity.

The Court’s inquiry went beyond the\n! As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2o22, the Jury Department of the Southern District of\nNew York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media\noutlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an atorney, and asking if he\ncould receive a copy of his <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> questionnaire. February 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at 3 n.2.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo332", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6,22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l8 of 4o\nsexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his oun sexual\nabuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. The Court finds that explanation to be reasonable.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\nquestionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely explanation for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his media interviews. That explanation\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\nquestionnaire included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally\ninaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer.

While at FIT, I took advantage of different volunteer opportunities and internships in\nthe fashion industry to provide a foundation for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a\nChristmastime internship at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as\na part-time employee. I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.\n\nIn the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where\nshe was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was\nelectrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,\nof difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of hou we both saw New York as a\nchance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)\nwas Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which ouned Henri Bendel\nat the time. When she <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have\nto carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later\nthat day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel\nclose by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted\nme to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they\nsexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I returned to my classes at FIT and\ncontinued work at Henri Bendel, but I started to crack. I failed a course that was necessary for my\ndegree and had to retake it to get my diploma.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo72o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675-3 Filed o6/25/22 Page2of5\n\nShortly after my first meeting with Epstein and Maxwell, I was offered a full-time position at\nHenri Bendel. It was a newly created position at the store, and it would have required me to leave FIT\na semester short of completing my degree. I had aspirations of going to law school and knew I could\nnot do so without my undergraduate degree, so I declined it.\n\nWhen Ghislaine found out she flew into a rage. I didn’t understand why until she told me\nthat she and Epstein were responsible for giving me that opportunity and that in turning it doun I\nwas being ungrateful. I nou knou this was their modus operandi — give a gift or favor and then\ndemand sex in return. Nevertheless, I rebuffed the guilt-trip ploy, <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> my coursework, and got\nmy FIT degree trom FIT, at which point I left Henri Bendel and took a position at Bloomingdales.\n\nI wanted to leave Epstein and Maxwell and the abuse they perpetrated against me behind as I\nstarted my professional life. I never wanted to or expected to see them again.\n\nOne day in the fall of l995 Maxwell shoued up at Bloomingdales, looking tor me. When I\nasked her hou she knew where I was, she said she asked my colleagues at Henri Bendel. She\nimmediately began befriending me once again, asking me to go out socially. I tried to resist but\neventually she wore me doun and I began spending time with them again. They made me feel like\nthey were friends, contemporaries.\n\nIn one instance, they took me to Florida, insisted that I stay longer than planned which caused\nme to miss work and led to my being fired. Seizing on this new vulnerability, they began trafficking\nme to their friends. By that time, I was trapped.\n\nI was assaulted, raped and trafficked countless times in New York and Florida during a three-\nyear period. At one point I became pregnant (by whom I am unsure) and aborted the baby. Things\nhappened that were so traumatizing that to this day ’m unable to speak about them; I don’t even have\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo72l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010759.jpg": ": Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page 6 of 353\nJuror ID: A |\nPRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS\nPlease read the follouing instructions carefully before completing any portion of this\nquestionnaire.

Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in\norder to determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations,\ndeemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l). (See, e.g., Commercial Standard\nTitle Co. v. Superior Court (l979) 92 Cal.App.3d 934, 945 [l55 Cal.Rptr.393].)\nLawyer-client confidentiality encompasses the lawyer-client privilege, the work-product\ndoctrine and ethical standards of confidentiality\n[2] The principle of lawyer-client confidentiality applies to information a lawyer\nacquires by virtue of the representation, whatever its source, and encompasses maters\ncommunicated in confidence by the client, and therefore protected by the lawyer-client\nprivilege, maters protected by the work product doctrine, and maters protected under\nethical standards of confidentiality, all as established in law, rule and policy. (See /n the\nMater of Johnson (Rev. Dept. 2ooo) 4 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. l79; Goldstein v. Lees\n(l975) 46 Cal.App.3d 6l4, 62l [l2o Cal.Rptr. 253].) The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion. Thus, a lawyer may not\nreveal such information except with the informed consent* of the client or as authorized\nor required by the State Bar Act, these rules, or other law.\n\nNarrou exception to duty of confidentiality under this rule\n[3] Notwithstanding the important public policies promoted by lawyers adhering to\nthe core duty of confidentiality, the overriding value of life permits disclosures otherwise\nprohibited by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).\nParagraph (b) is based on Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(2), which narrouly permits a lawyer to disclose information protected by Business\nand Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) even without client consent.\nEvidence Code section 956.5, which relates to the evidentiary lawyer-client privilege,\nsets forth a similar express exception. Although a lawyer is not permited to reveal\ninformation protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) concerning a client’s past,\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> criminal acts, the policy favoring the preservation of human life that underlies\nthis exception to the duty of confidentiality and the evidentiary privilege permits\ndisclosure to prevent a future or ongoing criminal act.\nLawyer not subject to discipline for revealing information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited under this rule\n[4] Paragraph (b) reflects a balancing between the interests of preserving client\nconfidentiality and of preventing a criminal act that a lawyer reasonably believes”* is\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page5of9\n\nAll Claim Forms must be <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> to the best of a Claimant’s ability and filed no later than the Filing\nDeadline.

When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me\n\nl5 Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted me to meet someone. It\nl6 was Jeffrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of\nl7 many times they sexually assaulted me.\n\nl8 Afterwards I tried to pretend everything was normal.\nl9 I returned to my classes at FIT and continued to work at Henri\n2o Bendel, but I started to crack. I failed a course that was\n2l necessary for my degree and had to retake it to get my diploma.\n22 Shortly after my first meeting with Epstein and Maxwell, I was\n23 offered a full-time position at Henri Bendel.

About two weeks ago I faxed your check off lists to John in preparation\n\nfor the manual. These are the lists you made and I'd say they are at least\n\n3/4 complete.

I'm not sure about #5\n\n(are you referring the changing the ink cartridge?) John CLEARLY\n\nunderstands he is to check Mr. E's computer prior to each arrival. I'm\n\nquite sure of this because we've discussed it several times and as recently\n\nas my visit last week.\n\nAs for as your second email, the Band-Aids are on the list titled \"Supplies\n\nneeded in the house at all times\" which is part of his check off list.\n\nOur Household Manual draft does indicate where to purchase \"cleaning\n\nsupplies” (Publix and Sam's Club-PB Gardens) and states \"use only Tide with\n\nbleach, douny softener(switch fragrance every 2-3 month), bounce dryer\n\nsheets\" We did edit and review this information last week houever we have\n\nnot <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> an inventory list/check off list of supplies yet. | GOVERNMENT\n\nI believe we have a GOOD start on the manual but it's certainly not up to ana\n\nour standards and needs further work and detail.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997).

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery.

Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o356", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020357.jpg": "CaSede2ot epQo33ouAUNt Bbeutent/2722 lFitsa S2o7 /2agFiagef 2 Of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o357", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-l, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page of 2\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nDEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON CATHERINE O'HAGAN WOLFE\nCHIEF JUDGE CLERK OF COURT\nDate: July o8, 2o22 DC Docket #: l:2o-cr-33o-l\nDocket #: 22-l426 DC Court: SDNY (NEW YORK\nShort Title: United States of America v.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes\nthat these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law\npresumptions of access atach. In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the specific arguments the\nGovernment has put forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy\ninterests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.\nSee United States v.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. <span class=\"highlight\">Completed</span> questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants\nthe Government's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided\nby the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes\nthat these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law\npresumptions of access atach. In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the specific arguments the\nGovernment has put forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy\ninterests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.\nSee United States v.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. <span class=\"highlight\">Completed</span> questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants the\nGovernment's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations against\nthe presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes that these are judicial\ndocuments and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access atach.\nIn balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, houever, the\nCourt finds that the specific arguments the Government has put forward in this leter,\nincluding the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims,\nfavor the narrouly tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o\n(2d Cir. l995). The Government's leter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By\nApril 23, 2o2l, the parties shall either propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6,\nwhich was originally filed under seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no\nredactions and file it on ECF.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. <span class=\"highlight\">Completed</span> questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

The parties' briefing should address whether an inquiry of some kind is permited\nand/or required, and, if so, the nature of such an inquiry. Although the Court reserves\ndecision on whether an inquiry of any kind is warranted, the Court grants the\nGovernment's request, Dkt. No. 568, to offer court-appointed counsel to the juror in issue.\nSubject to the juror's right to decline court-appointed counsel, the Court will appoint the\non-duty CJA counsel to represent the juror. If counsel for the juror wishes to be heard on\nthe issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry, briefing by the juror's counsel may be filed\nby January 26, 2o22. The Court will not adjourn post-trial briefing on other issues as\nrequested by the Defense, Dkt.

The parties are ORDERED to submit via email any\nproposed redactions on or before January l3, 2o22, justifying any such request by\nreference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid.\nCo. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). If any redactions are proposed, the Court\nwill determine whether any are appropriate and then docket the motion. The parties shall\nrespond to Juror 5os motion on or before January 2o, 2o22. Upon further reflection,\nunless and until Juror No. 5o is permited to intervene, he may have no standing to be\nheard on the question of whether an inquiry should be conducted. Accordingly, the Court\nwithdraws the aspect of its prior order seting January 26, 2o22, as the date by which\ncounsel for Juror 5o should file a submission on the issue of the appropriateness of an\ninquiry. Dkt. No. 57l. The Court will hear from the parties first regarding Juror 5o's\npending motion. Depending on the resolution of that motion, the Court will provide\nfurther guidance to counsel for Juror 5o regarding any permited submission. Ifa further\nsubmission is permited, the Court will provide ECF docketing access to counsel for Juror\n5o at that time (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on l/l2/22)Gw) (Entered: ol/l2/2o22)\n\nol/l4/2o22 576 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court required the parties to indicate whether\nJuror 5o's motion to intervene and to be provided a copy of the jurors <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nquestionnaire and voir dire should be redacted. Dkt. No. 575. In response, the parties\nhave submited leters to the Court indicating their differing views on whether Juror 5os\nmotion should be docketed at all. Upon further reflection, the Courtconcludes that it must\nfirst address the threshold question of whether an inquiry is permitedand/or required\nbefore considering Juror 5os requests. Accordingly, the Court will not consider or act on\nJuror 5o's request to intervene and to be provided a copy of the jurors <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nquestionnaire and voir dire until the Court receives the parties briefing on the\nappropriateness of an inquiry and the nature of any such inquiry.

Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his background,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions.

No. 57o.!\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, the Defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 33, on the basis of Juror 5o’s statements. Dkt. Nos. 6l3, 642. In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process. Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. &\nOrder, at 7.\n\nD. Evidentiary Hearing\n\nThe hearing took place on March 8, 2o22. Juror 5o appeared with retained counsel and\ntestified pursuant to a grant of immunity. Hearing Tr. at 3-5. Juror 5o confirmed he understood\nthat if he provided false answers he could be prosecuted for perjury. /d. at 5. The Court\nconducted the questioning with input from counsel; both parties submited proposed questions in\nadvance for the Court’s consideration. Dkt. Nos. 635, 636. The Court’s inquiry went beyond the\n! As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2o22, the Jury Department of the Southern District of\nNew York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media\noutlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an atorney, and asking if he\ncould receive a copy of his <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> questionnaire. February 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at 3 n.2.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o952", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020960.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel34 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6, 22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020961.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel35 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l8 of 4o\n\nsexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his oun sexual\nabuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. The Court finds that explanation to be reasonable.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\nquestionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely explanation for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his media interviews. That explanation\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\nquestionnaire included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally\ninaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020965.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel39 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\n\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (‘Tm also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o965", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB.

On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®® Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that ... l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nia According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021318.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l44 3536o38, Pagel46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 348\n\ncooperation.'®° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\noth Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\nams Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l372", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”°>\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021412.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 338 3536o38, Page24o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.3!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.3!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\ncae Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021414.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34o 3536o38, Page242 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original).

Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021438.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA 962 3536o39, Page8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*®° Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”3°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”\"°° Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n366 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n362 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n2o8 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n389 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l438", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3599 3536o39, Page38 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*\"°\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\n4l6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Relevant Facts\n\nIn 2oo5, the Palm Beach Police Department in\nFlorida opened an investigation into Epstein on the\ncomplaint of the parents of a fourteen-year-old girl.\nThe Palm Beach Police ultimately brought the investi-\ngation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in West\nPalm Beach, which in turned opened an investigation\nwith the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern Dis-\ntrict of Florida “USAO-SDFL’). (SA3). That investiga-\ntion culminated in a draft sixty-page indictment pro-\nposing to charge Epstein for the sexual abuse of multi-\nple victims. (SA3).\n\nIn 2oo7, the USAO-SDFL and Epstein entered into\na non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). (A.l73). The\nagreement was signed “on the authority of R. Alexan-\nder Acosta, United States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida.” (A.l75). Under the terms of the\nNPA, Epstein agreed to plead guilty in a pending Flor-\nida state case and to receive a sentence of at least\neighteen months’ imprisonment and twelve months’\ncommunity control. (A.l76). He also consented to juris-\ndiction in the Southern District of Florida for civil suits\ninvolving victims specified by the USAO-SDFL, among\nother terms. (A.l77). In exchange, USAO-SDFL\nagreed to defer “prosecution in this District.” (A.l75).\nOnce Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his half of the bargain, the\nNPA provided that “no prosecution” for the offenses\nthen under investigation by “the Federal Bureau of In-\nvestigation and the U.S. Atorney’s Office ... will be\ninstituted in this District.” (A.l75).\n\nThe NPA also provided that, if Epstein complied\nwith the agreement, “the United States also agrees\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l674", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021697.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page5o of 93\n37\n\nThe reach of the 2oo3 amendment to Section 3283\nis clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the\nstatute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, Judge\nNathan correctly resolved this analysis at Landgraf\nstep one. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—\nat worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it\nshould proceed to Landgraf step two, which examines\nthe retroactive effects of the statute.\n\ni. Landgraf Step Two\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf,\n“le]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-\nplying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is unques-\ntionably proper in many situations.” 5ll U.S. at 273.\n“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely be-\ncause it is applied in a case arising from conduct ante-\ndating the statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations\nbased in prior law.” Id. at 269. Instead, the question is\nwhether the statute “would impair rights a party pos-\nsessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for\npast conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\ntransactions already <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>.” Jd. at 28o. Im-\nportantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-\nstituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does\nnot make application of the rule at trial retroactive,”\nbecause parties have “diminished reliance interests in\nmaters of procedure” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-\ndure regulate secondary rather than primary con-\nduct.” Id. at 275.\n\nIn Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), this Court considered a new\nstatute of limitations that shortened the time to file\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l697", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021702.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page55 of 93\n42\n\nstep two of Landgraf is satisfied, and Section 3283 ap-\nplies retroactively. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 55 (If\n[a statute] would not [create impermissible retroactive\neffects], then the court shall apply the statute to ante-\ncedent conduct.”). Accordingly, the charges were\ntimely. l°\n\n2. Section 3283 Reaches Counts Three and\n\nFour\n\nMaxwell separately argues that Section 3283 does\nnot apply to Counts Three and Four because neither is\nan “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse ...\nof a child.” Maxwell contends that these counts, which\ncharged her with transporting a minor with intent\nthat the minor engage in illegal sexual activity and\nconspiracy to do the same, are not offenses involving\nthe sexual abuse of a child because a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> sex act\nis not an essential element of either charge. But Max-\nwell does not dispute that the evidence at trial estab-\nlished that her commission of Counts Three and Four\ninvolved <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> sex acts abusing one or more minor\nvictims. Nor could she, as Jane testified that she was\n\nlo As the Government argued belou, and as Judge\nNathan found, Count Six is also timely under l8\nU.S.C. § 3299, which eliminated the statute of limita-\ntions for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l in 2oo6, and\nwhich also applies retroactively under Landgraf for\nthe same reasons discussed above with respect to Sec-\ntion 3283. (A.l96 (concluding that, “like § 3283, § 3299\napplies retroactively to offenses for which the previous\nlimitations period has not yet run’)).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021703.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page56 of 93\n43\nin fact sexually abused when transported across state\nlines, including to New York, as a minor. Instead, Max-\nwell insists that Counts Three and Four do not involve\nsexual abuse of a child because a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> sex act is\nnot an element of those crimes. This argument mis-\nreads the relevant statutes and legislative history, and\nruns contrary to the decisions of this Court and other\nCourts of Appeals.!!\na. Counts Three and Four Are Offenses\nInvolving the Sexual Abuse of a\nChild\n\nMaxwell’s entire argument is based on a mistaken\npremise: that the phrase “offense involving the sexual\n... abuse ... of a child,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, only encom-\npasses crimes in which “unlawful sexual activity actu-\nally took place.” (Br.44). This flawed proposition ig-\nnores relevant statutory definitions, which make clear\nthat Section 3283 reaches more broadly to include of-\nfenses in which there was no <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> illegal sex act.\n\nAs described above, Section 3283 was originally\ncodified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k). The definition of the\nterm “sexual abuse” is located within that same sec-\ntion:\n\nFor purposes of this section ... the term\n‘sexual abuse’ includes the employment,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement,\n\nll Maxwell raises no analogous argument with re-\nspect to Count Six, which charges sex trafficking of a\nminor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021705.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page58 of 93\n45\n\nillustrative, not exhaustive.” Christopher  v.\nSmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. l42, l62 (2ol2)\n(citing Burgess v. United States, 552 U.S. l24, l3l n.3\n(2oo8)). And the text of Section 3283 goes even further\nbeyond the definition provided in Section 35o9 by cov-\nering any crime “involving” the sexual abuse of a child.\nCongress therefore did not require that a particular\nstatute have actual sexual contact with a minor as an\nelement of its offense, but rather swept broadly to\ncover any crime that in any way involves sexual abuse\nas broadly defined. Given this expansive language,\nsexual abuse “as defined here encompasses a wider set\nof behavior than just rape or other unwanted sexual\ntouching.” United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl97 (8d Cir. 2ol5). Thus, courts throughout the coun-\ntry have concluded that Section 3283 applies to a vari-\nety of offenses that do not require “a sexual act be-\ntween a defendant and a specific child,” United States\nv. Vickers, No. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA), 2ol4 WL l838255, at\n*ll (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4), or “physical contact with\nthe victim,” Carpenter, 68o F.3d at llo3; accord\nUnited States v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 7l4, 72o (5th Cir.\n2ol5).\n\nSection 3283’s definition thus captures crimes of in-\ntent where a perpetrator seeks to have a minor engage\nin sexual contact even if such sexual contact does not\noccur. Transportation of a minor with intent to engage\nin an illegal sex act (as charged in Count Four) and\nconspiracy to commit the same (as charged in Count\nThree) fall comfortably within that definition. Even\nthough a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> sex act is not required to commit\nthose two crimes, Count Four has “sexual abuse” as an\nelement because it requires the defendant to\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021709.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page62 of 93\n49\ncontact with a child. Counts Three and Four each have\nan “essential ingredient” that fits within that broad\ndefinition. See supra Point II.B.2.a.\n\nFinally, neither Dieh! nor United States v. Coun-\ntentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll), supports the use\nof a categorical approach. (Br.5l-52). In each decision,\nthe court concluded that Section 3283 applied to the\nsubject offenses without considering the specific facts\nof the crime, but in neither case did the court consider\nwhether a categorical approach was required—let\nalone hold that it was.\n\nAs noted above, it is undisputed that the evidence\nat trial established that Maxwell’s commission of\nCounts Three and Four involved <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> sex acts\nabusing one or more minor victims: Jane testified that\nshe was in fact sexually abused when transported\nacross state lines, including to New York, as a minor.\nAccordingly, Counts Three and Four qualify as of-\nfenses involving the sexual abuse of a child both by\ntheir statutory terms and based on the specific facts of\nthis case.\n\nPOINT Ill\nThe District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in\nConcluding that Juror 5o Could Be Fair and\nImpartial Notwithstanding His Inadvertent\nMistakes on His Juror Questionnaire\n\nMaxwell contends that she was denied her right to\na fair and impartial jury because a juror failed to dis-\nclose during voir dire that he was sexually abused as a\nchild, and therefore incorrectly answered three\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021710.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page63 of 93\n5o\n\nquestions on his writen questionnaire. After an exten-\nsive hearing, Judge Nathan concluded that the juror’s\nerror was inadvertent, and in any event, she would not\nhave struck the juror for cause had he answered those\nquestion accurately because he was not biased in any\nway against Maxwell and was qualified to serve as a\njuror. Judge Nathan therefore found that Maxwell\nfailed to meet the high bar for a new trial and denied\nher motion. This Court should affirm that careful de-\ntermination.\n\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nIn November 2o2l, in advance of trial, 694 jurors\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a juror questionnaire approved by the Dis-\ntrict Court. (Dkt.529 at 2). The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and consisted of 5l questions, many of\nwhich contained subparts. (A.29o-3l7). After the par-\nties reviewed the questionnaires, 23l of the 694 pro-\nceeded to voir dire. (Dkt.529 at 2-4). The District Court\nthen examined prospective jurors, asking them about\nquestions in the jury questionnaire that prospective\njurors had answered affirmatively. The District Court\nasked the prospective jurors whether the information\nor experiences resulting in the affirmative answer\nwould interfere with their ability to be fair and impar-\ntial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the District Court\nqualified 58 jurors. (Voir Dire Tr.7l7). Of the 58 indi-\nviduals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight in-\ndividuals responded to Question 48 of the juror ques-\ntionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021711.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page64 of 93\n5l\n\nsexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault,\nand that this experience would not affect their ability\nto serve fairly and impartially as a juror in the case.\n(A.344-45; Voir Dire Tr.l8, 52, 2oo, 2o7, 259, 293, 532,\n538-39, 635). Each confirmed that he or she could be\nfair and impartial, and defense counsel did not move\nto strike any these jurors for cause based on their answer\nto Question 48. (A.345).\n\nFor instance, one juror said that she was “sexually\nmolested by an uncle when she was l2 or l8,” but that\nwould not affect her ability to be fair and impartial in\nthe case. (A.345). Another juror indicated that she had\nrecently “reported that a friend was being coerced and\nsexually abused by a professor,” but confirmed that ex-\nperience would not “in any way interfere with her abil-\nity to be fair and impartial” in this case. (/d.). Neither\nthe Government nor defense counsel challenged those\njurors for cause.\n\nThe parties then exercised their peremptory\nstrikes, and a jury was seated.\n\n2.

Such a result is not\nlegally required by Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio, and therefore Thomas’s motion should be denied.\n\nD. Any Draft Inspector General Report is Not Subject to Disclosure\n\nThomas argues that any report by the Inspector General and related materials must be\nproduced because he speculates that such a report will address systemic issues at the BOP,\nincluding purported staffing shortages at the MCC. (Mot. 5, 9-lo). For the reasons set forth above,\nany draft Inspector General Report is not discoverable because the issues Thomas believes it will\ndiscuss are not material to the preparation of a valid defense, see Part II.B, and the draft reports,\nto the extent they exist, are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege. While\nthe prosecution team has had no involvement in writing the Inspector General Report, the\nGovernment understands that those atorneys from DOJ-OIG responsible for writing the Report\nhave not yet <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a draft, and do not anticipate completing the Report in the near term. As\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022089.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 27 of 34\nsuch, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas’s motion can be denied on that\nreason alone. Moreover, Thomas’s request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet\nexist—fails for two additional reasons.\n\nFirst, drafts of the Inspector General’s Report, which has not been <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and will\nlikely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the\ndeliberative process privilege, which “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions\nand policies are formulated.’” Dep ’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532\nU.S. l, 8 (2ool) (quoting V.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 42l U.S. l32, l5o (l975)). The\nprivilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Fernandez, 23l F.3d l24o, l246-47 (9th Cir. 2ooo) (government’s death penalty\nevaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative\nprocess privilege); In re Sealed Case, l2l F.3d 729, 737-4o (D.C. Cir. l997) (indicating that the\nprivilege applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284\n(S.D.N.Y. l998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege). “In order for the privilege to apply,\nthe agency record at issue must be (l) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or leter; (2)\npre-decisional; and (3) deliberative.” Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d\nl5o, l55 (2d Cir. 2o2o). “Tt is well-setled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically\npre-decisional and deliberative [because] [t]hey reflect only the tentative view of their authors;\nviews that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their\nsuperiors.” Color of Change v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 325 F. Supp. 3d 447, 453 (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol8) (quoting Amnesty Int’l USA v. CIA, 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 5l8 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo)).\n\nThe Inspector General’s Report is both pre-decisional and deliberative. A full draft has not\n\nye)\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022090.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 28 of 34\nbeen <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, let alone reached a point where the final version will be disclosed to the public.\nIt is also deliberative in that it will likely make recommendations about the BOP, and those\nrecommendations will be under discussion within the Office of the Inspector General prior to being\nfinalized and publicly announced. Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in\nreaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports. The ability to have these\ndiscussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues. Here, disclosure\nof any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine\nthe DOJ-OIG’s ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to\ninmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on\nthe issues. Accordingly, Thomas’s motion should be denied for the reason that the materials\nsought are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9.\n\nSecond, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector\nGeneral’s Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials\nupon which the Report is based—are subject to disclosure. To the extent that the forthcoming\nInspector General’s Report relies on information gathered during the instant investigation and\nprosecution, those underlying materials—which focus primarily on the events of August 9 and lo,\n2ol9, the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein, and related MCC records—have already been disclosed\nto the defendants. Thomas contends that those tasked with preparing the Report may “possibl[y]”\nhave generated additional witness statements and “other information” that has not been produced\nby the Government to date. (Mot. 5). Thomas provides no support for such assertions besides\nmere speculation. The prosecution has inquired of the Washington D.C.-based atorneys who are\npreparing the Inspector General’s Report. Based on those conversations, it is the prosecution’s\nunderstanding that those atorneys have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022102.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page6of9\nit has already delivered to Thomas all of the materials gathered by OIG personnel in the course\nof investigating this case, and that “it is the prosecution’s understanding that [OIG] atorneys\nhave not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise discovered any potential Brady\nmaterial.” Jd. at 23-24. Thomas has not identified any specific material that might be in OIG’s\npossession that has not been disclosed.\n\nThe Court, therefore, has no basis to compel the Government to disclose additional\nevidence underlying the Inspector General’s report. “[C]ourts in this circuit have repeatedly\ndenied requests for discovery orders where the [G]overnment represents that it has produced\ndiscovery to defendants pursuant to Rule l6 and has made a good faith representation to the\ndefense that it recognizes and has complied with its obligations under Brady and its progeny.”\nUnited States v.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'®° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB.

On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\n7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff's Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff's Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023156.jpg": "cooperation.'°© When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nls The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023210.jpg": "[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\na Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.jpg": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.jpg": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023250.jpg": "NPA.?!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD.

The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3lo Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2325o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023252.jpg": "the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at —_ a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023274.jpg": "civil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n366 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n368 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023304.jpg": "strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.jpg": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

As described in greater detail in Chapter 2, inmate counts and 3o-minute rounds are two\nmeans by which the BOP accounts for inmates and assesses their safety, security, and well-being. BOP and\nMCC New York policies require that staff members count all inmates in each housing unit within the facility\nat designated times each day. Additionally, BOP and MCC New York policies require that a staff member\nobserve all SHU inmates at least once during the first 3o minutes of each hour (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.)\nand again during the second 3o minutes of the hour (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.), thus ensuring that inmates\nare observed at least twice per hour. BOP staff are required to document inmate counts and 3o-minute\nrounds on official BOP forms, which are often referred to as “count slips” and “round sheets.”\nDuring the OIG's investigation, the OIG obtained information that the staff assigned to the MCC New York\nSHU did not conduct any counts of inmates within the SHU from August 9, 2ol9, at approximately 4 p.m.,\nuntil Epstein was found hanged in his cell on the morning of August lo, 2ol9.

Again, houever, SHU staff on duty during that period had falsely certified in\nthe round sheet that the required rounds were conducted.

All MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said\nthey did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than\nsuicide. Additionally, none of the l5 inmates who agreed to be interviewed in connection with this\ninvestigation, lo of whom were housed in the SHU on August 9 and lo, had any credible information\nsuggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Further, the SHU staff and the\nthree interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s cell from their cells stated that\nno one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein to his cell on the evening of\nAugust 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC New York SHU.

Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely\nseparated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per\nday, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC\nNew York SHU at l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.4 During their shift, they each created and submited falsified\nofficial BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and\nsigned more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 3o-minute rounds (often\n* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. on August 9, 2ol9, folloued by an overtime shift in the\nSHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.

The indictment\nalleged that on August 9, 2ol9, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and lo p.m. counts of inmates\nin the MCC New York SHU, and that on August lo, 2ol9, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the\nmandatory l2 a.m., 3.a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 3o-minute rounds within the MCC New York\nSHU. The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, certified, and submited false\ndocumentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to\nperform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU,\nincluding Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9, until approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, when\nEpstein was found hanged in his cell.\nOn May 25, 2o2l, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred\nprosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court\nrecord in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely certified that they had\nconducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely\ndisclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the\nU.S. Atorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete loo hours of\ncommunity service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision\nand their establishment of good behavior.

Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count\nslips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and\nThomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor\njudgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties.\nIl.

The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the\nSHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,\nAssociate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC\nNew York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had\n5 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check\nSheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute\nrounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023376.jpg": "Inmates in the SHU are securely separated from general population inmates and are kept locked in their cell\nwhen in their assigned tier within the SHU. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the\nOIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that,\nweather and resources permiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters\n5 hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the\nopportunity to shouer at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates\nmay also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court\nappearances, medical and psychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all\nvisitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on\nwork details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought\ninto a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the\ninmate's locked cell door.\nBOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 3o continuous calendar days are to be examined\nand interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's adjustment and the threat\npresented to self or others.\nBOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other\nthings, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit.

Inmate Accountability”\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted. MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that\ncounts must occur at l2 a.m., 3.a.m., 5.a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at lo p.m.\ndaily and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates\nwhile the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier. This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count\nin the same manner.

BOP’s Special Investigative Services (SIS) opened an\ninvestigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether Epstein harmed himself or had\nbeen assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, at approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Houever, Epstein\nremained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation\nuntil July 3o, 2ol9.4\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the\ninmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a\nlouer classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except\nthat inmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who\ngoes on and off suicide watch. The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes\nrecommendations to the institution’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of\nsuicide watch. According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off\nof suicide watch be housed with other inmates; houever, she said the recommendations cannot always be\ncarried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends\nconducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.\nThe Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide\nPrevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive\nstaff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief\nPsychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be\nhoused with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.\nAccording to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted\ndisciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was\ninsufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically\nevaluated on July 3o, 2ol9, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember\nhou he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2ol9, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2ol9,\nincident was <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself\nor that he had been harmed by his cellmate.\n74 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9.\n5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.\n\n3l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23398", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023399.jpg": "Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could\nbe paired up with Inmate l again.

The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych Observation and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on\nmultiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and atentive about Epstein’s special needs.\nAccording to Associate Warden l, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.\nAssociate Warden l said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant\nshould have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement. Associate Warden l further told the OIG\nthat the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for ensuring that everything within the SHU was in compliance.\nAssociate Warden l told the OIG that the SHU staff knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and\nsaid she personally heard it being discussed on more than one occasion when she would visit the SHU while\nperforming her rounds.\nThe Captain, who supervised all of the Lieutenants and COs working in MCC New York, said that after the\ncellmate requirement was issued for Epstein, he spoke with the SHU Lieutenant and directed him to ensure\nthat Epstein had a cellmate.

According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knouing why he was\nplaced on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled geting a drink of water the night prior and\nthen went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment\nrecords reflect that Epstein wanted to knou why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had\nbeen found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had\nplaced the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm\nthoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide atempts; and denied\nfeeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and\nthat his future plans included fighting his criminal case and geting back to his normal life. The Staff\nPsychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation. The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained\nin the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 3o,\n2ol9.7? Also on July 24, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist 2 <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to\nForensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding hou he sustained\nthe scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had\ntried to kill him but was nou claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic\nPsychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cellmate tying a string or rope around his neck.\nFollouing Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from\nsuicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein doun to\npsychological observation from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, who both\n22 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9; houever, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2ol9.\n\n45\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023414.jpg": "his personally ouned medical device.

According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate's\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.

Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023428.jpg": "what happened on that phone call.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

The lo p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nAt the time of the lo p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in\ntheir cells for the night. At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for\nconducting the lo p.m. stand up count. At lo p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were Noel\nand the Material Handler.

Nonetheless, Noel and the Material Handler <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and signed the lo p.m. SHU\ncount slip. The lo p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as “73 + l.” According to the MCC\nNew York master count sheet for the lo p.m. count on August 9, 2ol9, all units had verbally reported their\ninmate counts to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m. At approximately lo:36 p.m., the Control Center\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> all paperwork and officially cleared the lo p.m. institutional count.\nThe Material Handler said he was present at the time of the lo p.m. count, but that the count was not\nconducted because everyone was tired.

Thus, at the time of the lo p.m. count, he had worked 22 consecutive hours at\nMCC New York.

He did not knou why the count slip listed\n\"73 + qe\nNoel told the OIG that she had conducted the SHU count alone at lo p.m. and that the Material Handler\nsigned the count slip even though he did not conduct the count with her. Houever, the OIG’s review and\nanalysis of the SHU security camera video conflicts with Noel’s statement that she conducted the lo p.m.\ncount. Specifically, the video reflects that it was not until between lo:29 p.m. and lo:36 p.m. when Noel\nwalked to different tiers inside the SHU. Yet, as described above, MCC New York records reflect that counts\nfrom all MCC New York housing units were reported to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m., as the count\n36 Prosecution was declined for BOP employees (other than Noel and Thomas) who falsely certified inmate counts and\nrounds on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\n37 The quality of the SHU video footage was poor.

Based on his review of this\nmaterial, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the l2 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued to\nlist 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told\nthe OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.\nAt approximately l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material\nHandler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. Noel and Thomas were\nresponsible for conducting the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU.

Noel said she did not knou why the l2 a.m. count slip documented that there were 73 inmates in\nthe SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. slips documented there were only 72 inmates. Noel recalled that\nThomas had spoken with someone and then they changed the count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she and CO 3 conducted the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts in MCC New York's lo South\nUnit, which is the single-celled secure unit adjacent to the SHU. Noel said that when she left the SHU to\nassist CO 3, she took the SHU keys with her and that no one could have accessed the SHU while she was\ngone because she had to physically open the door for anyone who came into the SHU. Noel also told the\nOIG that when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived to conduct a round at approximately\n4a.m., Noel let her into the SHU. The OIG’s review and analysis of the SHU video shous that the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant arrived in the SHU at approximately 4 a.m., visited the lo South Unit at\n4:o4 a.m., returned to SHU at 4:ll a.m., and left the SHU at 4:l4 a.m. According to Noel, no one other than\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3, as detailed later belou, entered the SHU during\nher shift.\nThomas told the OIG that since he had begun working with the BOP in 2oo7, he had worked in the SHU fairly\nregularly and he was familiar with hou to work in the SHU and hou the SHU operated.

He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras.

Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023450.jpg": "recorded video was available for several of the institution's cameras, so she reported the mater to the\nCommunications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his\nshift was scheduled to end. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\ninstitution's approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG\nfound that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic\nchecks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to\nrecord.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he nou checks to ensure that all\ncameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report\nabout the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.\n\nB. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure\nOn August 8, follouing discovery of the recording failure, Company l service request records reflect that the\nElectronics Technician contacted a Company l technical support representative, who ultimately determined\nthat two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems.

The fact that these failures have\nbeen recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and\nrelated problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe OIG has <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DOJ personnel have commited misconduct.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate. The failure to make these required\nnotifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further belou—\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023470.jpg": "on the evening of August 9 and the morning of August lo.

False Statements and Lack of Candor\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in\nCharge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas made false statements when they falsified BOP records by\natesting that they had <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not.\nFederal law provides that “whoever, in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3).\nAs discussed above, the OIG found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler,\nNoel, and Thomas failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts.

Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Atorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York\ndeclined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler.\nThe OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel,\nand Thomas knouingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by atesting that they\nhad <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nAdditionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation\nand truthfully respond to questions. The OIG found that Noel lacked candor when she told the OIG that she\nhad conducted the lo p.m. count when the weight of evidence indicates that, at most, she may have\nconducted a round at the time.\n3. Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York supervisory staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 4%) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023476.jpg": "TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s responsibility to do so.

Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system.

Follouing that, he held a\nnumber of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at\nBear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknoun policy violations in l98l. He also worked as a\nfinancial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.\nMr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a\nconsultant wit the late l98os. pee age described as his\nfirst mentor. as later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi\nscheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his oun\npersonal use. Years later Or Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company,\ngranted him pouer of atorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2482l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024822.jpg": "Page 284\nInstitutional History: On July 6, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in\nNew Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR PDS-BEMR)E | Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9. During this screening,\nMr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No\nsymptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level | and\nwas not diagnosed with a mental illness.\nFollouing a consultation wi National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on\nJuly 8, 2 erp at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein\nshould be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary\nconsideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and\nmedia atention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.\nMr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, after normal business hours.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

He also worked as a\nfinancial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.\nMr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a\nconsultant wit in the late i ela described as his\nfirst mento as later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi\nscheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his oun\npersonal use. Years late | Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J.

Despite also being identified ashore |\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24943", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024944.jpg": "Page 485\nInstitutional History: On July 6, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in\nNew Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR (PDS-BEMRP Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9.

Primary\nconsideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and\nmedia atention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.\nMr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, after normal business hours.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

Epstein and Company,\ngranted him pouer of atorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified as\" O\"™\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years.

The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo252l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025220.jpg": "Page 976\nInstitutional History: On July 6, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in\nNew Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR (PDS-BEMR)E™ \"Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9.

The need for a cellmate was communicated between Day Watch\n(DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the\nEW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer ie, ee\nstaff were informed at approximately l:5o p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmaf would likely not\nreturn from court. Furthermore, Officers\" hoted Mr. Epstein would need a cellmate upon\narrival from his atorney visit.\n\nA review of the 3o-minute rounds forms indicate unit rounds were <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> for the entire MW\nshift on August lo. 2ol9. Houever, a memorandum from Lieutenant\" | ndicates\nOffice tnd Material Handler orn om Leta, Jo after\nMr. Epstein’s death that they did not complete proper 3o-minute rounds at 3:oo a.m. or 5:oo a.m.\nDESCRIPTION OF SCENE\nA detailed description of the scene was unavailable because the officers who discovered\nMr. Epstein did not write memorandums and could not be interviewed. According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the a. began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

Inmates on suicide watch are\nevaluated daily by apsychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions.\nOnce an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist\nfollouing a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.\nWith regard to staffing levels, l5,ol2 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and l,654\ncorrectional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2ol9. The BOP continues to work on hiring and\nretaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General. The\nBOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess\nany additional measures which should be taken after those processes are <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>.\nThe factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors\ninclude an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a\nplan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.\nPublic Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(2o2) 3532o \"|\npate ——hvanenrs ll:39 AM >>>\nThe USA Today's top reporter (who's writen front page stories on the BOP) is asking if BOP is \"designating\nspecific officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations\nwhere inmates are at some risk for suicide.\"\nDOJ-OGR-ooo26o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026087.jpg": "Page 24ll\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o8/lo/2ol9 o7:25 Provider: —— __}?

Follouing that, he held a\nnumber of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at\nBear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknoun policy violations in l98l. He also worked as a\nfinancial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.\nMr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a\nconsultant wit the late l98os. pee age described as his\nfirst mentor. as later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi\nscheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his oun\npersonal use. Years later Or Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company,\ngranted him pouer of atorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027288.jpg": "the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an\nadditional supervisory psychologist to provide critical clinical services.\nStaffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction.\n\nHouever, the details about this topic are provided in an After Action Review <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nseparately from this report.\n\nl3.

Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet.

Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.

Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\njokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Weill, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\ngraduated.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many childhood friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a difference [as] our worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000069.tif": "6a\nthe commencement of trial, prospective jurors <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\na lengthy questionnaire, with several questions rais-\ning issues relevant to the trial. Based on the <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>\nquestionnaires, the parties selected prospective jurors to\nproceed to in-person voir dire. The District Court\nultimately empaneled a jury.\n\nDuring the four-and-a-half-week jury trial, the\nGovernment presented evidence of the repeated sexual\nabuse of six girls. At the conclusion of trial, on\nDecember 29, 2o2l, the jury found Maxwell guilty on\nall but one count.®\n\nFollouing the verdict, Juror 5o gave press interviews\nduring which he stated that he was a survivor of child\nsexual abuse.’ In his answers to the writen jury\nquestionnaire, houever, Juror 5o answered “no” to\nthree questions asking whether he or a friend or\nfamily member had ever been the victim of a crime;\nwhether he or a friend or family member had ever been\nthe victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or\nsexual assault; and whether he or a friend or family\nmember had ever been accused of sexual harassment,\nminors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charged Maxwell with\ntransportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2. Count Five\ncharged Maxwell with sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of\nl8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Six charged Maxwell with sex trafficking\nof a minor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2.\nCounts Seven and Eight charged Maxwell with perjury, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. The perjury charges were severed\nfrom the remaining charges and ultimately dismissed at sentencing.\n\n6 The jury found Maxwell guilty on Counts One, Three, Four,\nFive, and Six.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!*’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023146.tif": "federal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”!®8 Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB.

On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\n72 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl79 According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023156.tif": "cooperation.'®© When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case]....

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023210.tif": "[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.***\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\n247 Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.tif": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcems about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n25o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25l In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.tif": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023250.tif": "NPA.?!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2325o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023252.tif": "the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original).

Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023274.tif": "civil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims.

This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.””\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

As described in greater detail in Chapter 2, inmate counts and 3o-minute rounds are two\nmeans by which the BOP accounts for inmates and assesses their safety, security, and well-being. BOP and\nMCC New York policies require that staff members count all inmates in each housing unit within the facility\nat designated times each day. Additionally, BOP and MCC New York policies require that a staff member\nobserve all SHU inmates at least once during the first 3o minutes of each hour (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.)\nand again during the second 3o minutes of the hour (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.), thus ensuring that inmates\nare observed at least twice per hour. BOP staff are required to document inmate counts and 3o-minute\nrounds on official BOP forms, which are often referred to as “count slips” and “round sheets.”\nDuring the OIG's investigation, the OIG obtained information that the staff assigned to the MCC New York\nSHU did not conduct any counts of inmates within the SHU from August 9, 2ol9, at approximately 4 p.m.,\nuntil Epstein was found hanged in his cell on the morning of August lo, 2ol9.

The indictment\nalleged that on August 9, 2ol9, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and lo p.m. counts of inmates\nin the MCC New York SHU, and that on August lo, 2ol9, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the\nmandatory l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 3o-minute rounds within the MCC New York\nSHU. The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, certified, and submited false\ndocumentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to\nperform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU,\nincluding Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9, until approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, when\nEpstein was found hanged in his cell.\nOn May 25, 2o2l, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred\nprosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court\nrecord in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely certified that they had\nconducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely\ndisclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the\nU.S. Atorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete loo hours of\ncommunity service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision\nand their establishment of good behavior. On December l3, 2o2l, after Noel and Thomas successfully\nfulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all\ncharges pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count\nslips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and\nThomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor\njudgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties.\nI. Methodology\nDuring the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one\noccasion. The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the\nSHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,\nAssociate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC\nNew York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had\n5 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check\nSheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute\nrounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023376.tif": "Inmates in the SHU are securely separated from general population inmates and are kept locked in their cell\nwhen in their assigned tier within the SHU. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the\nOIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that,\nweather and resources permiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters\n5 hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the\nopportunity to shouer at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates\nmay also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court\nappearances, medical and psychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all\nvisitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on\nwork details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought\ninto a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the\ninmate's locked cell door.\nBOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 3o continuous calendar days are to be examined\nand interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's adjustment and the threat\npresented to self or others.\nBOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other\nthings, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit. When a staff\nmember is assigned to the SHU at the last-minute and has not <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the quarterly training, the staff\nmember must be advised of the general requirements of a SHU post and be permited to ask questions\nabout the duties.\n2. Inmate Accountability\"\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted. MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that\ncounts must occur at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at lo p.m.\ndaily and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates\nwhile the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier. This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count\nin the same manner. When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate's body and\nnot rely solely on movement or sound. Officers conducting the count relay the count verbally to the Control\nThis section describes inmate accountability measures that are most relevant to this investigation and review.

BOP’s Special Investigative Services (SIS) opened an\ninvestigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether Epstein harmed himself or had\nbeen assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, at approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Houever, Epstein\nremained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation\nuntil July 3o, 2ol9.4\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the\ninmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a\nlouer classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except\nthat inmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who\ngoes on and off suicide watch. The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes\nrecommendations to the institution’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of\nsuicide watch. According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off\nof suicide watch be housed with other inmates; houever, she said the recommendations cannot always be\ncarried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends\nconducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.\nThe Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide\nPrevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive\nstaff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief\nPsychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be\nhoused with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.\nAccording to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted\ndisciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was\ninsufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically\nevaluated on July 3o, 2ol9, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember\nhou he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2ol9, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2ol9,\nincident was <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself\nor that he had been harmed by his cellmate.\n24 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9.\n5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.\n\n3l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23398", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023399.tif": "Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could\nbe paired up with Inmate l again.

The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cell mate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych Observation and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on\nmultiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and atentive about Epstein’s special needs.\nAccording to Associate Warden l, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.\nAssociate Warden l said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant\nshould have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement. Associate Warden l further told the OIG\nthat the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for ensuring that everything within the SHU was in compliance.\nAssociate Warden l told the OIG that the SHU staff knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and\nsaid she personally heard it being discussed on more than one occasion when she would visit the SHU while\nperforming her rounds.\nThe Captain, who supervised all of the Lieutenants and COs working in MCC New York, said that after the\ncellmate requirement was issued for Epstein, he spoke with the SHU Lieutenant and directed him to ensure\nthat Epstein had a cellmate. Similar to the Warden, the SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that while there is no\nBOP policy addressing the necessity of assigning cellmates to individuals coming off of suicide watch, it was\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23399", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023412.tif": "Also on July 23, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment that included a clinical\ninterview of Epstein and a review of Epstein’s medical record, the psychology data system, and a review of\nthe SENTRY database. According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knouing why he was\nplaced on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled geting a drink of water the night prior and\nthen went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment\nrecords reflect that Epstein wanted to knou why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had\nbeen found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had\nplaced the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm\nthoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide atempts; and denied\nfeeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and\nthat his future plans included fighting his criminal case and geting back to his normal life. The Staff\nPsychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation. The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained\nin the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 3o,\n2ol9.7? Also on July 24, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist 2 <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to\nForensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding hou he sustained\nthe scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had\ntried to kill him but was nou claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic\nPsychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cell mate tying a string or rope around his neck.\nFollouing Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from\nsuicide watch.

According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise.

The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9.

The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span>, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate’s\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.

Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager.

Noel initially told\nthe OIG that she did not conduct the 4 p.m. count on August 9, but after acknouledging that she signed the\n4 p.m. SHU count slip, Noel said she did not recall if she conducted the count. According to Noel, she and\nother SHU staff filled out the count slip before conducting the counts because they knew the number of\ninmates they were supposed to report.\n2. The lo p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nAt the time of the lo p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in\ntheir cells for the night. At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for\nconducting the lo p.m. stand up count. At lo p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were Noel\nand the Material Handler. Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness\nstatements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff did not perform the lo p.m.\ncount in the SHU.?”? Nonetheless, Noel and the Material Handler <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and signed the lo p.m. SHU\ncount slip. The lo p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as “73 + l.” According to the MCC\nNew York master count sheet for the lo p.m. count on August 9, 2ol9, all units had verbally reported their\ninmate counts to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m.#8 At approximately lo:36 p.m., the Control Center\n<span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> all paperwork and officially cleared the lo p.m. institutional count.\nThe Material Handler said he was present at the time of the lo p.m. count, but that the count was not\nconducted because everyone was tired.

Thus, at the time of the lo p.m. count, he had worked 22 consecutive hours at\nMCC New York.

He did not knou why the count slip listed\n\"73 + l\",\nNoel told the OIG that she had conducted the SHU count alone at lo p.m. and that the Material Handler\nsigned the count slip even though he did not conduct the count with her. Houever, the OIG’s review and\nanalysis of the SHU security camera video conflicts with Noel’s statement that she conducted the lo p.m.\ncount. Specifically, the video reflects that it was not until between lo:29 p.m. and lo:36 p.m. when Noel\nwalked to different tiers inside the SHU.

Therefore, in conjunction with reviewing the video, the OIG analyzed\nwitness statements and BOP records to beter determine what the video depicted.\n8 The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2343o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023433.tif": "Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she believed she told the SHU staff to conduct a new count\nand create a new count slip, but she did not knou if they had actually done so.\nDuring his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate\ntransfer, the l2 a.m. institutional count, and the housing unit count slips. Based on his review of this\nmaterial, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the l2 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued to\nlist 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told\nthe OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.\nAt approximately l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material\nHandler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. Noel and Thomas were\nresponsible for conducting the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and analysis\nof the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and\nThomas did not perform any of these counts. Nonetheless, Noel and Thomas <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> and signed SHU\ncount slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center cleared the\nl2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. institutional counts at approximately l2:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., and 5:3o a.m.,\nrespectively. Noel and Thomas both admited to the OIG that they did not conduct the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and\n5 a.m. counts on August lo, and that they had falsified the respective count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she signed the August lo l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips that Thomas had\nprefilled. Noel said she did not knou why the l2 a.m. count slip documented that there were 73 inmates in\nthe SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. slips documented there were only 72 inmates. Noel recalled that\nThomas had spoken with someone and then they changed the count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she and CO 3 conducted the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts in MCC New York's lo South\nUnit, which is the single-celled secure unit adjacent to the SHU. Noel said that when she left the SHU to\nassist CO 3, she took the SHU keys with her and that no one could have accessed the SHU while she was\ngone because she had to physically open the door for anyone who came into the SHU. Noel also told the\nOIG that when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived to conduct a round at approximately\n4a.m., Noel let her into the SHU. The OIG’s review and analysis of the SHU video shous that the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant arrived in the SHU at approximately 4 a.m., visited the lo South Unit at\n4:o4 a.m., returned to SHU at 4:ll a.m., and left the SHU at 4:l4 a.m. According to Noel, no one other than\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3, as detailed later belou, entered the SHU during\nher shift.\nThomas told the OIG that since he had begun working with the BOP in 2oo7, he had worked in the SHU fairly\nregularly and he was familiar with hou to work in the SHU and hou the SHU operated. Thomas described\nhis responsibilities while working in the SHU as to maintain the count of inmates, make sure the inmates are\nfed, and, depending on the shift, make sure they get their shouers. Thomas’s Overtime Schedule shoued\nthat he worked 2l shifts in the SHU during morning watch from May through August 2ol9. The overtime\nschedule also shoued that Thomas worked l2 overtime shifts in the SHU when Epstein was assigned to the\nSHU in July and August 2ol9.\n\n66\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23433", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023470.tif": "on the evening of August 9 and the morning of August lo. Noel told the OIG that she conducted the lo p.m.\ncount on August 9. The OIG did not credit her statement based on: (l) its review of the SHU security\ncamera video, which reflects Noel walking up and doun the stairs leading to some, but not all, of the tiers\nseveral minutes after the SHU inmate count had been called into the Control Center; (2) the lo p.m. count\nslip, which erroneously included the SHU Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and\nDelivery; (3) other BOP records; and (4) the Material Handler’s statement to the OIG that no one conducted\nthe lo p.m. count because everyone was tired.\nInstead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found\nthat officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, including the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas\nprimarily remained seated in the SHU Officers’ Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time,\nsuggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of Internet searches on MCC New York\ncomputers. Thomas also admited to the OIG that he “dozed off” for periods of time during his shift. The\nOIG’s analysis of the SHU security camera video revealed that after approximately lo:4o p.m., no CO\nentered Epstein’s tier in the SHU until just before 6:3o a.m. when Noel and Thomas began to serve breakfast\nto the inmates.\nThe OIG investigation and review concluded that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material\nHandler, Noel, and Thomas failed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their\nrespective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, and that their actions constituted\nviolations of 5 C.F.R. 88 2635.lol(b)(5) and 2635.7o5(a), BOP Program Statements 342o.ll and 55oo.l4, and\nMCC New York SHU Post Orders.\n2. False Statements and Lack of Candor\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in\nCharge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas made false statements when they falsified BOP records by\natesting that they had <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not.\nFederal law provides that “whoever, in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3).\nAs discussed above, the OIG found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler,\nNoel, and Thomas failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each\ninstitutional inmate count, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two COs to conduct each\ncount and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York form, often called a\ncount slip.”> On the count slip, both COs are required to fill in the date and time the count had been\nperformed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then sign the\ncount slip. Once the COs complete and sign the count slips, the count slips are then collected and delivered\nto the MCC New York Control Center.

Additionally, Noel admited\nto the OIG that she had prefilled the official MCC New York forms documenting the times of the 3o-minute\nrounds, often referred to as round sheets, and falsely atested to having <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the rounds.”®\nNoel and Thomas were indicted by a grand jury for their false certifications of having conducted counts and\nrounds. Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Atorney's Office of the Southern District of New York\ndeclined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler.\nThe OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel,\nand Thomas knouingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by atesting that they\nhad <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nAdditionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation\nand truthfully respond to questions. The OIG found that Noel lacked candor when she told the OIG that she\nhad conducted the lo p.m. count when the weight of evidence indicates that, at most, she may have\nconducted a round at the time.\n3. Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York supervisory staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 %) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023747.tif": "avaiability of staff.

If violated, he could very well be put on an ankle bracelet which\nwould be even more of a restriction to him.\nRe: Similar defendants on community control and early termination, drawing from my experience (8 % yrs. of\ndoing these cases), Daliah Weiss, Chief of SVU, and DOC there is no knoun case where a Sex Offender on\nCommunity Contro! has ever been given early termination of Community Control by agreement from our office or\nDOC.

Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\nJokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Well, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\ngraduated.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many childhood friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a difference [as] aur worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully <span class=\"highlight\">completed</span> medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225"};
