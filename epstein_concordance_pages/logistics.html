Because this leter\ncontains identifying information relating to victims, the Government respectfully requests that the\nCourt accept the Government’s proposed redactions to this leter.\n\nGovernment position:\nI.

Sealed and Redacted Exhibits\n\nThe Government anticipates offering certain exhibits entirely under seal or with redactions\nto protect the personal identifying information of witnesses and third parties. With respect to\n<span class=\"highlight\">logistics</span>, the Government would propose submiting redacted versions of exhibits — along with an\nindex noting which of the Government exhibits will be offered under seal — no later than November\n29, 2o2l. To the extent the defense takes issue with the sealing requests or the proposed redactions,\nthe Court may rule on those exhibits on case-by-case basis during the trial.\n\nThe Government has considered hou best to publish sealed exhibits to the jury while\nprotecting the identities of witnesses and the privacy of third parties. On that score, the\nGovernment is mindful that exhibits published in electronic format on screens in the courtroom\nmay be seen by the public, since the screens at counsel table — and potentially the jury box— are\nvisible to the public from certain angles. For this reason, the Government requests permission to\nprovide jurors with individual binders containing sealed exhibits.

In particular, the Court directed the\nparties to: (l) provide nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected, (2) propose\nprocedures for voir dire related to witness identities, (3) submit a proposed instruction to the jury\nregarding witnesses testifying under pseudonyms or under their first name only, and (4) address\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">logistics</span> of offering sealed or redacted exhibits containing personal identifying information.\nBelou are the positions of the parties regarding these logistical considerations. Because this leter\ncontains identifying information relating to victims, the Government respectfully requests that the\nCourt accept the Government’s proposed redactions to this leter.\n\nGovernment position:\nI. Nomenclature\n\nWith respect to nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected at trial,\nthe Government respectfully submits the follouing chart, which provides the true names of\nwitnesses and the proposed nomenclature for those witnesses at trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006356.jpg": "Cesash: 2@2orOCRReP AON Ducunrent42 Areelinyim77l Paetagee afdt 7\nPage 4\nprejudice to the defendant, as the instruction makes clear to the jury that the identities of the\nwitnesses are being protected from the public and press only, and that the true names of the\nwitnesses are knoun to the Government, the Court, and the defendant.\nIV. Sealed and Redacted Exhibits\n\nThe Government anticipates offering certain exhibits entirely under seal or with redactions\nto protect the personal identifying information of witnesses and third parties. With respect to\n<span class=\"highlight\">logistics</span>, the Government would propose submiting redacted versions of exhibits — along with an\nindex noting which of the Government exhibits will be offered under seal — no later than November\n29, 2o2l. To the extent the defense takes issue with the sealing requests or the proposed redactions,\nthe Court may rule on those exhibits on case-by-case basis during the trial.\n\nThe Government has considered hou best to publish sealed exhibits to the jury while\nprotecting the identities of witnesses and the privacy of third parties. On that score, the\nGovernment is mindful that exhibits published in electronic format on screens in the courtroom\nmay be seen by the public, since the screens at counsel table — and potentially the jury box— are\nvisible to the public from certain angles. For this reason, the Government requests permission to\nprovide jurors with individual binders containing sealed exhibits. The Government expects that\njurors will follou the Court’s instruction to only view items in the binder when the Court instructs\njurors to do so.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6356", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006974.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 Filed ll/l5/2l Page2of43 2\nLalWmaxC\n\nl (Case called; appearances noted)\n\n2 THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe parties respectfully submit this leter regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">logistics</span> for public access for\nclosing arguments. The parties propose that they will release a public version of their slides (to\nthe extent they do not contain sealed materials) follouing the conclusion of the trial day on the\nsame basis that they have been releasing public exhibits during trial. This proposal appropriately\nbalances the public interest in access to closing arguments with the Court and the parties’ interests\nin avoiding delay and effective advocacy on behalf of their clients, as well as the interests of\nvictims and third parties protected by the Court’s sealing orders.!\n\n' Closing argument demonstratives are not part of the official trial record. The approach jointly\nproposed by the parties is consistent with trials conducted without electronics, where the public\nwould not be in a position to see white boards or easel displays positioned facing the jury box.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8439", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document558 Filed l2/l9/2l Page2of5\n\nAt the outset, it bears noting that the public interest in viewing the parties’ presentations is\nmarginal. The core of closing argument is the advocacy of the atorneys, which will be available\nto all persons in the courtroom, juror and member of the public alike. And a significant amount\nof the material—including all of the Government’s and the vast majority of the defense's slides—\nwill consist of exhibits, excerpts from the transcript, and text from the jury charge. Accordingly,\nlitle additional material would be made public through these slides: to the extent that information\nshould be publicly available, it already is. The parties are also likely to identify many exhibits by\nnumber during argument, permiting any observers with copies of the key exhibits to follou along.\n\nBy contrast, counsel for both parties agree that complicated <span class=\"highlight\">logistics</span>—including either\nbinders or toggling public monitors on and off—raise significant concerns. First, they would risk\nsignificant delay. The Court, the jury, and the parties have made efforts to complete presentation\nof argument and jury instructions tomorrou. As the Court has no doubt observed during trial, the\nuse of binders has been time-consuming, as jurors must lift sometimes-heavy binders and flip\nthrough them to find the correct page. In order to turn the public monitors on and off, Court staff\nmust manually do so in the courtroom and each overflou room.

SO ORDERED.\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) A ‘ | | -\nDear Judge Nathan: l2/l9/2l\nThe parties respectfully submit this leter regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">logistics</span> for public access for\nclosing arguments. The parties propose that they will release a public version of their slides (to\nthe extent they do not contain sealed materials) follouing the conclusion of the trial day on the\nsame basis that they have been releasing public exhibits during trial. This proposal appropriately\nbalances the public interest in access to closing arguments with the Court and the parties’ interests\nin avoiding delay and effective advocacy on behalf of their clients, as well as the interests of\nvictims and third parties protected by the Court’s sealing orders.!\n' Closing argument demonstratives are not part of the official trial record. The approach jointly\nproposed by the parties is consistent with trials conducted without electronics, where the public\nwould not be in a position to see white boards or easel displays positioned facing the jury box.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8448", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008449.jpg": "Cedash: 2Q2or OCS AON Demme Areelie7le922ol Patege afd 5\n\nAt the outset, it bears noting that the public interest in viewing the parties’ presentations is\nmarginal. The core of closing argument is the advocacy of the atorneys, which will be available\nto all persons in the courtroom, juror and member of the public alike. And a significant amount\nof the material—including all of the Government’s and the vast majority of the defense's slides—\nwill consist of exhibits, excerpts from the transcript, and text from the jury charge. Accordingly,\nlitle additional material would be made public through these slides: to the extent that information\nshould be publicly available, it already is. The parties are also likely to identify many exhibits by\nnumber during argument, permiting any observers with copies of the key exhibits to follou along.\n\nBy contrast, counsel for both parties agree that complicated <span class=\"highlight\">logistics</span>—including either\nbinders or toggling public monitors on and off—raise significant concerns. First, they would risk\nsignificant delay. The Court, the jury, and the parties have made efforts to complete presentation\nof argument and jury instructions tomorrou. As the Court has no doubt observed during trial, the\nuse of binders has been time-consuming, as jurors must lift sometimes-heavy binders and flip\nthrough them to find the correct page. In order to turn the public monitors on and off, Court staff\nmust manually do so in the courtroom and each overflou room. This process takes several\nminutes, and the parties anticipate that it will have to occur repeatedly during the course of the\nparties’ presentations.\nSimilarly, even in televised trials, the public may not see demonstratives used during closing\nargument. Asa courtesy to the public, the parties have agreed to make the demonstratives available\nfor public review after closing arguments are delivered.\n* The demonstratives are atorney work product, which counsel may elect not to publish during the\nflou of closing argument.

Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive <span class=\"highlight\">logistics</span> involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011624.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 739 Filed o8/lo/22 Page3oof43 3\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl I got supplemental briefing on to discuss.

The first is that unfortunately I do think we will\nll need to ask for a briefing schedule to preclude\nl2 cross-examination on certain topics of government witnesses.\n\nl3 On Friday afternoon, the government conferred with defense\nl4 counsel. We presented about a dozen topics that we believe are\nl5 clearly improper topics for cross-examination. Yesterday\nl6 defense counsel told us that they're not in a position to tell\nl7 us that they will not cross on any of those topics. Because\nl8 there are many of them and because they include things like\nl9 criminal convictions that are beyond the scope of 6o9 and other\n2o personal information that might either identify anonymized\n2l witnesses or embarrass witnesses, we would ask to be able to\n22 submit briefing rather than raise those issues on the public\n23 record.\n24 THE COURT: You can, but not until you have further\n25 discussion and narrou disputes, because that's going to happen.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll624", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 739 Filed o8/lo/22 Pagel7of43 l7\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl THE COURT: So I will allou -- I don't knou if it's\n\n2 admissible.

And\nl7 we've also been working to get podium turned so that it's\n\nl8 facing the jurors.\n\nl9 And then I think there will be paper copies of the\n2o presentations of the parties, for counsel who have screens that\n2l are facing the gallery.\n22 THE COURT: Right.
