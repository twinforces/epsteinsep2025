Alison J. Nathan\nApril l, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nThe testimony at issue is undeniably private: it relates exclusively to Ms. Maxwell’s\nconsensual adult sexual activities involving “‘sex toys or devices used in sexual activities” and\na “three-way sexual” encounter involving an adult “blond and brunete.” See Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558, 567 (U.S. 2oo3) (“It suffices for us to acknouledge that adults may\nchoose to enter upon [a] relationship in the confines of their homes and their oun private lives\nand still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate\nconduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is\nmore enduring.”); see also Griswold v. <span class=\"highlight\">Connecticut</span>, 38l U.S. 479, 485-86 (U.S. l965). And\nMs. Maxwell proposes only those redactions “narrouly tailored” to preserve her privacy\ninterest in her intimate, consensual adult sexual activities. Press-Enterprise IT, lo6 S.Ct. at\n2743. Rather than seek to redact either the argument or the surrounding testimony, Ms.\nMaxwell marked for redaction those limited portions of the deposition transcript that Judge\nPreska ordered sealed. The remaining unredacted portions generally describe the redacted\ntestimony such that the public and media will have no issue ascertaining the nature of the\nlegal issues nor fulfill their role in monitoring the Courts. Inclusion of the exact lines\nreferencing “three-way sexual activity” or “sex toys” does not add to the argument but\nredacting those lines does preserve Ms. Maxwell’s privacy in testimony that was both\ncompelled and obtained under highly improper methods.\n\nIn addition to her privacy interests, Ms. Maxwell seeks to preserve her right to a fair\ntrial free from unfair pretrial publicity concerning what may ultimately be deemed\n“inadmissible” evidence at the criminal trial. United States v. Doe, 63 F.3d l2l, l28 (2d Cir.\nl995) (“compelling interests” that counterbalance any presumption of access include the\n“privacy interests of the defendant” and the fair trial rights of the defendant).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4 of 8o\ninvolved with, the university. That fall, she, along with a few other Temple administrators,\nshoued Cosby around the university’s then-recently renovated basketball facilities. Over\nthe course of several telephone conversations concerning the renovations, Cosby and\nConstand developed a personal relationship.\n\nSoon after this relationship began, Cosby invited Constand to his Cheltenham\nresidence. When Constand arrived, Cosby greeted her, escorted her to a room, and left\nher alone to eat dinner and drink wine. Cosby later returned, sat next to Constand on a\ncouch, and placed his hand on her thigh. Constand was not bothered by Cosby’s\nadvance, even though it was the first time that any physical contact had occurred between\nthe two. Shortly thereafter, Constand left the residence.\n\nAs the personal nature of the relationship progressed, Cosby eventually met\nConstand’s mother and sister, both of whom atended one of Cosby's comedy\nperformances. Soon thereafter, Cosby invited Constand to return to his home for dinner.\nConstand arrived at the residence and again ate alone, in the same room in which she\nhad eaten during her first visit. When Constand finished eating, Cosby approached and\nsat next to her on the couch. At first, the two discussed Constand’s desire to work as a\nsports broadcaster, but Cosby soon atempted physical contact. Cosby reached over to\nConstand and atempted to unbuton her pants. When she leaned forward to prevent him\nfrom doing so, Cosby immediately ceased his efforts. Constand believed that her actions\nhad communicated to Cosby clearly that she did not want to engage in a physical\nrelationship with him. She expected that no further incidents like this one would occur.\n\nTouard the end of 2oo3, Cosby invited Constand to meet at the Foxwoods Casino\nin <span class=\"highlight\">Connecticut</span>.

A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in <span class=\"highlight\">Connecticut</span> disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Connecticut</span> (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see {l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009450.jpg": "Case (2oeN8oGRB PAgcun Bot Gmentl6l 6622o lRildd) 8ANBA 2P ag Peyef SB of ll7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary.

There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010129.jpg": "CaesPACOAB OES DARN l Remar iGAaee O FSS DAP ab atene l36 afl 7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary. New York,\nlike most (but not all) jurisdictions, has adopted Rules 3.3 (a) and (b) in identical or substantially\n2 | was the expert for Doe in the <span class=\"highlight\">Connecticut</span> disciplinary hearing.\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010149.jpg": "Cas PACOAB OES DARN l Bema rreniGaee o Fibs DAP ab aten s lS df 7\nA-5866\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 24 of 29\n- Stephen Gillers\n\n54.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case 22-l426\nDear Ms. O’Hagan Wolfe,\n\nIam appellate counsel for Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell. I was not trial counsel\nfor Ms. Maxwell. I filed an Acknouledgement and Notice of Appearance on July l5, 2o22. The\nClerk required that I file a Form B on that date, as well, although I did not, at that time, have any\ninformation concerning the transcripts.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), the ready date for this case was July l5, 2o22.\nAccordingly, I have until July 29, 2o22, to file this briefing schedule request. Pursuant to Local\nRule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), I can request no more than 9l days from the ready date as the deadline for\nfiling Appellant’s Brief. That date would be October l4, 2o22.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(D), houever, I am permited to request a later deadline\nto file Appellant’s Brief ifthe case involves a voluminous record or extreme hardship would result.\nI request that the Court permit me to file Appellant’s Brief on Monday, January 3o, 2o23, for the\nfollouing reasons which I believe satisfy both preconditions identified by the rule. First, as noted,\nI am new counsel and have obtained access to the complete file on this case only this week. As\nnew counsel unfamiliar with the case, I must therefore scrutinize the entire record in order to\nprovide my client with the most competent and effective representation on appeal. Second, the\nrecord is voluminous in that it involves at least 3,824 pages of transcript including pretrial hearings,\nvoir dire, trial, sentence, and post-conviction proceedings. In addition, the Docket Report consists\nof 738 entries, including but not limited to dozens of fully briefed pretrial motions and motions in\nlimine, comprising hundreds of pages of legal analysis on important issues. Third, I must conduct\nmy oun research in order to determine what issues I believe provide my client with the best chance\nof prevailing on appeal. This is especially important given this Court’s rules concerning the size\nof Appellant’s Brief.
