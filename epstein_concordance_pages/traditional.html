Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.?

Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach.

In United\nStates v. Florida West Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9 (S.D. Fla. 2ol2), the\ngovernment, follouing a plea agreement with a foreign air cargo provider that immunized certain\nclasses of the provider’s employees and related corporations, indicted a U.S. airline and an\nindividual, both of whom asserted that they were within the scope of employees and corporations\ncovered by the plea agreement. /d. at l2l5-l6.

Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988). This presumption\nagainst retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal\ncontext. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis.

As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It\n\nand Accuse Villafana of Improper Conduct\n\nl. December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to <span class=\"highlight\">Traditional</span> Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\n<span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 28 of 34\nmaterial information to a federal judge in an ex parte proceeding, “[t]he call for the court’s\nsupervisory pouer .. . is at its strongest and most defensible.” Cortina, 63o F.2d at l2l4.\n\nMaxwell need not satisfy the standard of Franks v.

As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R.

Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It\n\nand Accuse Villafana of Improper Conduct\n\nl. December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.” !*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l75 of 349\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to <span class=\"highlight\">Traditional</span> Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\n<span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 263 of 349\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°7 In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004797.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel3 of 2l\nor another substantive constitutional provision supplies a standard for the suppression of\nevidence, courts must follou that standard, not invent their oun.

In addition, the Court can\nlegitimately place a specific time limit on atorney-conducted voir dire.

The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend.

Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree.

Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.?

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 3o of 3l\n\nThat admonition requires courts applying the Second Circuit’s “special circumstances”\nexception to grand jury secrecy to invoke it only in rare, “exceptional circumstances,” mindful of\nthe precedent that unsealing would set. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3. The exception, after all,\nderives from a district court’s supervisory authority over grand juries, id. at lo2 & n.2, which\ncarries with it the duty to safeguard “the <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> functioning of the institution,” United States\nv. Williams, 5o4 U.S. 36, 5l (l992). Applying the exception casually or promiscuously, as the\nGovernment’s motion to unseal the summary-witness grand jury testimony here invites, would\nrisk “unravel[ing] the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised,” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo3, and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before “future grand\njuries,” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 222, that the general rule of secrecy still holds.\n\nThis factor weighs heavily against unsealing. Granting the Government’s motion would\nbloat the “special circumstances” doctrine, which to date has warranted disclosure in only a tiny\nnumber of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious\npublic or historical moment. And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials,\nbecause they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous. The same\ncould be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in\nsupport of charges that later proceeded to trial.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 82 of 95 282o\nLCIAMAX2ps\n\nl THE COURT: Thank you.\n\n2 MR.

It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oool9898\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019965.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagelo6 of 2oo 43\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl I do want to note, before I go further, to pick up on\n2 something the court said.

As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”©? Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome .. . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n2 Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafafia\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nlS Villatfafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l298\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021348.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel76 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.**? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”°>\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to <span class=\"highlight\">Traditional</span> Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\n<span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021438.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA 962 3536o39, Page8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*®° Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”3°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”\"°° Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n366 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n362 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n2o8 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n389 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021538.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 36) 3536o39, Pagelo8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l4 of 2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span>\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022829.tif": "Page 286\nl focus kind of exclusively on Epstein and like his\n2 criminal conduct with respect to women.\n3 Do you -- you said yesterday a couple\n4 times that, like, you nou kind of recognize or think\n5 that there was things that he did that you didn't\n6 knou about, and that he kept from you or that you\n7 didn't see.\n8 What did you see?

As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”°’ Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.® Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions’”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl4 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl5 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023186.tif": "The USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.tif": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.tif": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to <span class=\"highlight\">Traditional</span> Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.tif": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\n<span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023274.tif": "civil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span> indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA.

I would not have been\nable to [do] this if it wasn’t for Mr. Epstein.\nAnother example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is puting\nthrough vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke\nrelated that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and\nmentor Mr. Diaz.\n\nA final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:\n\nWhile working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a\nrelationship with the cleaning man who details our office space. Alfredo\nand I reflect life’s issues and family maters as best fas] a Colombian and\nEnglish speaking friend may, but it takes us deep and a look or gesture\nspeaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken\nEnglish and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter atending\ncollege. Alfredo told me hou proud he is of her atending college. “Me\ndaughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which\nled to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,\nMister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to\nme he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the\ndream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such\nconsequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one\n\n‘ man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the <span class=\"highlight\">traditional</span>\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical insurance.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233\n"};
