See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations.

None of the Questions or Answers Were Material\n\nA. Materiality\n\nSection l623(a) of Title l8 of the U.S. Code states, in relevant part, that “[w]hoever\nunder oath ... in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United\nStates knouingly makes any false material declaration” shall be subject to criminal penalty\n(emphasis added). Thus, to violate § l623(a), a perjurious statement must be “material to the\nproceeding in which it is given.” United States v. Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997)\n(emphasis omited).\n\nTo be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable\nof influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it is addressed.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (quotation marks omited). When made during a civil\ndeposition, statements are material only if “a truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to\nlead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit.” United States v.\nKross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994). In proving materiality, it “is necessary . . . that the\ngovernment shou that the statement, if believed, could have <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the decision” of the\ndecision-making body. United States v. Stern, No. o3 Cr. 8l, 2oo3 WL 22743897, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2o, 2oo3).\n\nAlthough issues of materiality are generally mixed questions of law and fact normally left\nto a jury, see Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23, under certain circumstances, like those presented in\nthis case, a court can decide this issue under Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(b). See United States v. Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo). Here, the deposition transcripts and Judge Preska’s\nruling provide the Court with the relevant undisputed facts to decide this motion. Thus a trial will\nnot assist in determining whether the Government can prove to a reasonable juror that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct violated l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). United States v. Nitschke, 843 F.

Counts 5 and 6 Should Be Dismissed\n\nNone of the questions that elicited the allegedly perjurious testimony were material to the\nproceeding in which the testimony was given.

Ms. Maxwell was a civil defendant in a defamation action\npremised upon a statement issued by her lawyer in the United Kingdom that Giuffre’s claims\nwere “obvious lies”—a statement that was, as shoun above, true. Whether Ms. Maxwell was\nable to make a list of “girls” who were at Mr. Epstein’s properties, knew who Epstein was\nhaving sex with (apparently when Ms. Maxwell was having sex with Epstein), was aware of the\n“presence of toys or devices,” or gave a massage to Epstein or Accuser-2 was completely\nirrelevant to the defamation litigation.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s testimony could not have <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> any fact finder in the civil case, nor\ncould the questions—no mater hou they were answered—have reasonably led to any admissible\nevidence in the defamation action, which required Giuffre to prove that her statements about her\nage, her being trafficked to unspecified “foreign presidents” and Professor Dershouitz, or\nwhether President Clinton flew on a helicopter piloted by Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other\ndemonstrably false statements, were true.°\n\n® In the event that Counts Five and Six are not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell would request that\nadditional excerpts be read those to the jury beyond those set forth in the Indictment, including but not\nlimited to those set forth in this motion, for purposes of completeness.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°* During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”. Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\n<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\n<span class=\"highlight\">INFLUENCED</span> BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\n<span class=\"highlight\">Influenced</span> by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\n<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of l6\nconvicted of perjury for an answer given under oath that is literally true, even if it is\nunresponsive and intended to mislead.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by improper factors.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 64 of 349\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6o of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\n<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\n<span class=\"highlight\">INFLUENCED</span> BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\n<span class=\"highlight\">Influenced</span> by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7l of 349\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\n<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8l of 349\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.””°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “chung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page9ofl7\npersistence” and “confirmation bias” are at work. Belief persistence occurs when an opinion\nformed is resistant to change even when proven wrong. Confirmation bias occurs when an\nindividual forms an opinion early in the decision-making process and then evaluates new\ninformation in a way that supports the earlier decision.' The jury questionnaire is the first\nopportunity jurors have to tell the lawyers and the Court what they are thinking and, more\nimportantly, what <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> them to think that way.\n\nGiven the likelihood intense media scrutiny of this trial, it is critical to use both a robust\nwriten jury questionnaire and individual sequestered voir dire to inquire about the extent to\nwhich each potential juror has been exposed to pretrial publicity and to what extent each juror\nhas formed an opinion of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein\n\nBecause there is always the fear that a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the entire\njury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity, a jury\nquestionnaire and individual voir dire in a case such as this is particularly warranted. If the Court\nwere to engage in public questioning of the venire panel en masse, answers could infect the\nentire panel. Alternatively, concerns about a panel member’s unanticipated answer may render\nthe questions too carefully worded to uncover the problem. Further, questions asked pose privacy\nconcerns that would require constant side bars.

It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure\non jurors to provide socially desirable or acceptable answers in a group seting, reduces\nconformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being\n<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury\nor be removed for cause.

The Court merely invited a discrete response to its proposed address to\nprospective jury but the government seized the opportunity to reargue.\n\nDuring the October 2l conference, the defense stated its reasons for preferring November 29, a\ndate when the Court could inquire whether any prospective jury might not be able to be fair or otherwise\nimpacted or <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by any reference to this case during the lo-day interval that included the\nThanksgiving holiday. Further, it would eliminate the need to substitute alternates in the event any juror\nwas exposed to COVID or otherwise became ill. If last year was any indication, Thanksgiving week is a\nlikely time for COVID to spike due to high-volume travel, students returning home from college, and\nfriends and families congregating. Even an exposure to the virus during the holidays can necessitate a\nprospective juror to quarantine for a time period past November 29.\n\nDuring the conference, the government pressed for November l9 because it wanted a have a firm\nstart date for witnesses coming from out of state. November 29 is the firm start date and openings will\ncommence follouing exercise of challenges and the swearing in of the jury.

It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 45\nl64 McElvaney\njustified.

Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey.

Large-scale national probability studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children.

Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 39 of 4l\nadopting outright a legal conclusion proffered by an expert witness, the testimony would remain\nobjectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).\n\n4.

It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact.

Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey.

Large-scale national probability studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children.

Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008075.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page6ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 5\nhindsight, labeled “grooming” or otherwise imputed as knouledge to onlookers.

Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 8 of 82\n\n] Instruction No. 3: Contact with Others/Social Media\n\n2 During your deliberations, you must not communicate with or provide any information to\n\n3 anyone by any means about this case.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write concerning an issue of pressing importance. It has come to the atention of the\ndefense that one of the twelve jurors in this case (the “Juror”) has been giving oral and videotaped\ninterviews to various members of the press concerning the jury deliberations. These interviews\nhave been publicly reported in several media outlets.' Among other things, the Juror told\nreporters that he disclosed to the other members of the jury during deliberations that he was a\nvictim of sexual abuse and further described his memory of those events. According to the Juror,\nhis disclosure <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the deliberations and convinced other members of the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\n! See Lucia Osborne-Crouley, “‘They were all believable’: Maxwell juror says jury was convinced by accusers’\naccounts of a patern of abuse,” The Independent (Jan. 4, 2o22); Laura Collins and Daniel Bates, “Ghislaine was a\npredator as guilty as Epstein’: Maxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex trafficker and reveals his\noun abuse ordeal,” Daily Mail (Jan. 5, 2o22), available at htps:/Avww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-\nlo37ol93/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html; Luc Cohen, “Some Ghislaine\nMaxwell jurors initially doubted accusers, juror says,” Reuters (Jan. 5, 2o22).\n2o7o3ol.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page2of5\n<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> deliberations. See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard. See Amodeo I, 44\nF.3d at l47.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page8ofl2\n\nBut these answers were inaccurate, at the very least.

He drew on his oun\nexperience, explaining, “I didn’t disclose my oun abuse until I was in high school,” and that he\ncannot remember all the details (“I knou what happened when I was sexually abused.

Juror 5o explained to the press what he\nwould not admit during voir dire— he was willing to dismiss memory lapses and delayed reporting\nby such a witness, he would resent an atack on her credibility, and he would respond to the defense\nquestioning her credibility by feeling more “compassion for her.”\n\nJuror 5o made similar comments to the Daily Mail. He took the “victim’s point of view\nand explained hou ‘you can’t remember all the details’ of traumatic memories.” He expressed his\nbelief that his “sexual abuse” gave “him access to a beter understanding of the testimony of\nvictims.” Similarly, to Reuters, Juror 5o said he told jurors his oun story of sexual abuse.\n\nWith the first prong of the McDonough test so clearly satisfied, the court’s inquiry should\nmove on to the second prong: whether an honest answer would have created a valid basis for\ndisqualifying the juror for cause.

The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B)\n\nDoes Not Apply.\n\nFinally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the\ngrounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> a minor to engage in\nprohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible\ndouble-counting to apply § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie\nFarmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully\naccounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double\ncounting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence\nto reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the\nGuidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 26l (2d Cir. 2ol2). Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual\nconduct and “enticing” minors to engage in commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] l2, 24, 27).'°\nWebster’s Dictionary defines the word “entice” to mean “to atract artfully or adroitly or by\narousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the\npresenting of an atraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or beter\njudgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to\nan act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of\nresistance or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for\n!o Count Three charged a conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. S2 Ind. {f\nl6-l9. Although this offense does not contain an element of “enticement” or “coercion,” the offense conduct for\nCounts One, Three, and Five (the three conspiracy counts) was consolidated under Count Three for the purposes of\nsentencing, pursuant to the Court’s order.

There is no\nevidence that “Jane” or Annie Farmer engaged in a commercial sex act. Accordingly, the\nenhancement should not apply to their two offense groups (Groups l| and 2).\n\nThird, the evidence does not support that Carolyn was “unduly <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span>” to provide\nsexualized massages to Epstein. The “undue influence” enhancement applies when “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nUSSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), Appl. Note 3(B). “[T]he defining characteristic of undue influence is\nthat it involves a situation where the influencer has succeeded in altering the behavior of the\ntarget.” United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks\nomited). Apart from Virginia Roberts initially offering Carolyn the opportunity to massage\nEpstein, the record indicates that Carolyn sought out additional massage appointments herself\nand recruited other minors to perform sexualized massages to make more money. (Tr. l527-28,\nl543-46). Carolyn further testified that after she became pregnant, she returned to Epstein\nwithout being contacted to earn additional money. (Tr. l548-49). In addition, Carolyn was not\nso <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her. Carolyn\ntestified that she refused their offers to have her travel with them to Epstein’s island. (Tr. l534-\n35). In sum, the record does not support the conclusion that Ms. Maxwell or anyone else\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page6of77\ngovernment added to the demonization of Ms. Maxwell by calling her a “villain” on the day of her\narrest.*\n\nBut in sentencing Ms. Maxwell, the Court cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by this inexorable\ndrumbeat of public condemnation calling for her to be locked away for good. The Court cannot\nheal the wounds caused by Epstein by heaping on Ms. Maxwell’s shoulders the pain of every one\nof his victims, the outrage of society, the public scorn of the community, and then driving her out\nof the community forever. While that may assuage the public and give the perception that “justice\nwas done,” that is not justice. That is scapegoating. Ms. Maxwell must be sentenced on the record\nbefore the Court and not these external pressures.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell’s Arrest and Detention\n\nAt dawn on July 2, 2o2o, a team of more than a dozen FBI agents arrested Ms. Maxwell at\nthe New Hampshire home where she had taken refuge after Epstein’s death to escape the upsurge\nof highly intrusive media coverage that had engulfed her and her family. She had relocated alone,\nseparating from her family to safeguard her husband and two young stepchildren and to secure the\npersonal safety of her family and herself. At that time, Ms. Maxwell was the target of numerous\ndeath threats and threats of violence and was being hunted by the press. One media outlet even\noffered a $lo,ooo bounty for information about her whereabouts. Tragically, this experience was\nnot new for Ms. Maxwell. Decades earlier, when Ms. Maxwell was just a child and her father was\na Member of Parliament, U.K. authorities found a “hit list” of potential kidnapping/assassination\ntargets in a safehouse used by the Irish Republican Army. Ms. Maxwell’s name was first on the\nlist. This unnerving experience has haunted her, heightening her vigilance and concerns about the\nwelfare and safety of her young stepchildren, who were being hounded by the media at school and\n* htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7J4ReLHvag, at 2:o9-2:l5.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 3oof55\nwas still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 6o6), and flight records make clear that\nthe defendant and Kellen flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times\nin 2oo3 and approximately ten times in 2oo4, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).\n\nThe combination of this evidence demonstrates that Kellen joined the conspiracy when\nMaxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC.

When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard.

In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7. And if the participant is at\n7 least ten years older than the minor, there is a rebutable\n\n8 presumption that the participant unduly <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the minor to\n9 engage in a commercial sex act.

Impermissible double counting\n\nl4 occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the\nl5 kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in\n\nl6 the Guidelines but does not occur if the enhancement aims at\n\nl7 differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects\n\nl8 different facets of the defendant's conduct. United States v.\nl9 Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2ol2). There isn't double\n2o counting here. The 2Gl.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v.

Similar conclusion, United States\n2 v. Smith, a Ninth Circuit case from 2ol3, 7l9 F.3d ll2o. That\n3 case explains 2G6l.3(a) base offense level and the undue\n\n4 influence enhancement \"Serve unique purposes under the\n\n5 Guidelines.\"\n\n6 The defense argues that because the enhancement\n\n7 applies only if undue influence was exerted with the aim of a\n\n8 commercial sex act, it does not apply here. But the jury in\n\n9 Count Six did convict the defendant of sex trafficking Carolyn\nlo to participate in commercial sex acts. The Court finds that\n\nll Virginia Roberts, who brought Carolyn and Melissa who was\n\nl2 brought by Carolyn similarly were paid. The remaining victims,\nl3 including Jane and Annie, also testified that they received\n\nl4 money and gifts during their abuse which satisfies the\n\nl5 enhancement.\n\nl6 The defendant argues Carolyn was not unduly <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span>\nl7 to sexually massage Epstein. I find this argument meritless.\nl8 The age gap between Carolyn and Epstein and the defendant far\nl9 exceeded ten years, and the defendant does not rebut the\n2o resulting presumption of undue influence. 2Gl.l, comment note\n2l 7.

In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7.

United States v.\nl9 Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2ol2). There isn't double\n2o counting here. The 2Gl.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v.

The Court finds that\n\nll Virginia Roberts, who brought Carolyn and Melissa who was\n\nl2 brought by Carolyn similarly were paid.

Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by improper factors.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021237.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N63 3536o38, Page65 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.°’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°’ During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.” Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\nSf Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\n58 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\nSY In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021333.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l59 | 3536o38, Pagel6l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\n<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\n<span class=\"highlight\">INFLUENCED</span> BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\n<span class=\"highlight\">Influenced</span> by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021344.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel72 of 258\nSA-l7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\n<span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021354.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l8o | 3536o38, Pagel82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, ‘‘a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?”°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.”*’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\neet Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

I overrule the defendant's\nlo objection.\nll The defendant first says the undue influence\nl2 enhancement would punish her for the same harm already counted\nl3 in her base offense level. Impermissible double counting\nl4 occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the\nl5 kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in\nl6 the Guidelines but does not occur if the enhancement aims at\nl7 differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects\nl8 different facets of the defendant's conduct. United States v.\nl9 Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2ol2). There isn't double\n2o counting here. The 2Gll.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App'x, 444 (2d\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l59o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021591.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OVALS 3536o39, Pagel6l of 2l7\n46\nM6SOmaxl\nl Cir. 2o2l) (summary order). Similar conclusion, United States\nZ v. Smith, a Ninth Circuit case from 2ol3, 7l9 F.3d ll2o. That\n3 case explains 2Gl.3(a) base offense level and the undue\n4 influence enhancement \"serve unique purposes under the\n5 Guidelines.\"\n6 The defense argues that because the enhancement\n7 applies only if undue influence was exerted with the aim of a\n8 commercial sex act, it does not apply here. But the jury in\n9 Count Six did convict the defendant of sex trafficking Carolyn\nlo to participate in commercial sex acts. The Court finds that\nll Virginia Roberts, who brought Carolyn and Melissa who was\nl2 brought by Carolyn similarly were paid. The remaining victims,\nLs including Jane and Annie, also testified that they received\nl4 money and gifts during their abuse which satisfies the\nl5 enhancement.\nl6 The defendant argues Carolyn was not unduly <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span>\nl7 to sexually massage Epstein. I find this argument meritless.\nl8 The age gap between Carolyn and Epstein and the defendant far\nl9 exceeded ten years, and the defendant does not rebut the\n2o resulting presumption of undue influence. 2Gl.l, comment note\n2l 7. Carolyn testified she was paid to give Epstein sexualized\n22 massages, and she needed the money for her drug addiction.\n23 Later, Carolyn returned to Epstein because she needed the money\n24 for herself and her newborn son. Plainly, taking advantage of\n25 a victim's financial need is a form of undue influence.

The OPR* (SAl-348) contains just such evidence of the negotiations\nbetween the Government and Epstein’s counsel which, in corroborating an intent on\nthe part of the parties to draft a co-conspirator clause that provided broader\nimmunity, accords with the plain meaning of the NPA.

The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some\nmiscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that\nsame evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening. The Electronics Technician told\nthe OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the institution to begin work on the problem that\nsame day.\nThe SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were\ndoun, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the institution before the malfunction was discovered.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on\nAugust lo when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident. Associate Warden l confirmed she\nwas with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she\nonly knew video could not be replayed. She did not knou the recording system for certain cameras was\ndoun. She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording.\nAccording to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2ol9, and atended to other\nmaters throughout the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the replacement hard drives and\natempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day. Houever, the Electronics Technician told the OIG\nthat no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was\nlocated, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, Correctional\nOfficer (CO) 4.° According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO\n4's shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the\nElectronics Technician performed the work. According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be\nat the institution the follouing day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the\nElectronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the follouing day. The Electronics Technician\nsaid his decision was <span class=\"highlight\">influenced</span> by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors\nthat such maters did not have to be atended to until the follouing day, and even if he had replaced the\nhard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore\nnot have finished until the follouing day anyway.\nC. SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August lo\nThe Electronics Technician arrived at the institution around 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, and shortly\nthereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he\nreported to the SHU to assist. Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in\nand around the SHU. The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the\nSHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2. While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video\nstreams on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard\ndrive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2ol9. Among the cameras whose video\nwas not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed.\n52 The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the institution's SIS unit, staff\nassigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians.\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345l\n"};
