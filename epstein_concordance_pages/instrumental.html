Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also <span class=\"highlight\">instrumental</span> on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001043.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagelo2 of 2oo 39\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl obligation to her through emotional manipulation.

The Protective Order in Giuffre v. Maxwell\n\nCounts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell commited\nperjury during two civil depositions taken in Giuffre v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case Virginia\nGiuffre filed in 2ol5. Giuffre claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell’s atorney-hired\npress agent denied as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Giuffre’s numerous allegations, over the span\nof four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause Giuffre to be “sexually abused\nand trafficked” by Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n' See Norman Mailer, “An Appeal to Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy,” 5/ll/8o New York\nTimes.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003052.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 239\nwas a protective order that would govern at least some of the materials, and that is why we\nultimately made the application to the Court.”)).\n\nWhile the Government appreciates, with the benefit of hindsight, that an answer that had\nalso referenced the February 2ol6 meeting (and the fact that USAO-SDNY took no action as a\nresult of that meeting) would have provided additional context—and would have further reinforced\nthat this was not a “Chemical Bank situation”—as noted above, the Government’s response\naccurately described its contacts with Boies Schiller as relevant to “your investigation” and the\nissuance of the subpoena at hand. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that a description of the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether\nshe was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of situation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2).\n\nIn Chemical Bank, counsel for a civil party approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s\nOffice “suggesting that it had evidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” l54 F.R.D. at\n93. In response, a grand jury subpoena was issued and “confidential documents were produced by\nthe defendant without complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the\n[confidentiality] orders.” Jd. Here, by contrast, the Government accurately conveyed to Chief\nJudge McMahon the opening of its investigation in late 2ol8, the reason it made contact with Boies\nSchiller shortly thereafter and served a subpoena in February 2ol9, and that no documents\ngoverned by the protective order had yet been produced. Aside from rank speculation loosely\npremised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her\nassertion that “Boies Schiller was <span class=\"highlight\">instrumental</span> in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot.\n3 at 2) (emphasis in original), or that AUSA-l’s February 2ol6 meeting with Boies Schiller (as it\nactually occurred) undercut the accuracy of the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon, or played any role in the Government opening its investigation in November 2ol8.\n\n9l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o Filed ll/2l/2l Page5of9\nwere <span class=\"highlight\">instrumental</span> in creating and structuring the terms of the Protocol.

As part of a disturbing agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell identified,\ngroomed, and abused multiple victims, while she enjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury and\nprivilege. In her wake, Maxwell left her victims permanently scarred with emotional and\npsychological injuries. That damage can never be undone, but it can be accounted for in crafting\na just sentence for Maxwell’s crimes.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in connection with the sentencing\nof Maxwell in the above-captioned case, which is scheduled for June 28, 2o22, and in response to\nthe defendant’s June l5, 2o22 sentencing memorandum and objections to the Pre-Sentence\nInvestigation Report prepared by the United States Probation Office. For the reasons set forth\nbelou, the Government maintains that under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the\n“Guidelines” or “U.S.S.G.”), the applicable sentencing range is 36o months to life imprisonment.\nBecause the statutory maximum penalty is 66o months’ imprisonment, the Guidelines range\nbecomes 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Pageloof55\nEpstein.

Epstein was no\nfootman; be loved luxury and, in his oun words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who\ncould shou the rich hou to live with their money. “I want people to understand the pouer, the |\nresponsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote.

This guy plays 26 hours a day.”\nThose who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind\ngoes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from\nmathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct\nanswer in the shortest period of time, That’s my definition of IQ.”\nA Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to\nmake connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is\nextremely smart and probing.
