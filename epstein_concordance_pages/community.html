Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (l984), reprinted in l984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3l82, 3l89. And that’s true no mater hou much rhetoric and hyperbole the\ngovernment and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,\ncompelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations\nof conduct from l4 to l7 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\nanticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered\n' New York’s age of consent was l7 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.\n\nSee N.Y.

See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag\nbetween the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo278", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000279.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 6 of l6\nfuture danger when viewed in the context of the unparalleled global media atention the case has\ngamered, including the creation of a website by the government requesting witnesses claiming\nabuse to come forward. Accordingly, any danger that Mr. Epstein may have once posed to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> has long since abated. At the very least, this enormous gap in time precludes a\nfinding by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>’s safety.°\nThe rebutable presumption of a risk of flight is negated by the evidence that the\n\ngovernment had stated it believed it could prosecute Mr. Epstein for the very same conduct for\nwhich he was immunized, albeit in a second jurisdiction, despite the protections conferred upon\nhim under the NPA. Mr. Epstein’s continuous presence in the United States even while he had a\nresidence out of the country reinforces the point. As detailed belou, Mr. Epstein understood the\nNPA as a global resolution of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here,\nincluding conduct in New York. Indeed, the government, in a Southern District of Florida filing\n® The government vastly overreaches in painting Mr. Epstein as dangerous based on musty plea\ndiscussions. The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation. See Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v.\nUnited States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 36l-lo (prosecutor stating, “[o]n the obstruction\ncharges, many of the facts that I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of [redacted]. We will need to interview her to confirm\nthe accuracy of those facts. . . .”), Dkt. 36l-ll (prosecutor stating, “I knou that someone\nmentioned there being activity on an airplane, I just wanted to make sure that there is factual\nbasis for the plea that the agents can confirm”), Dkt. 36l-9 (prosecutor stating, “I don’t knou the\nfactual basis for the alleged [redacted] because we have no independent evidence of that’). In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000286.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l3 of l6\n\n“bail statute does not . . . require that foreign defendants be detained simply because their\n\nreturn cannot be guaranteed through extradition”);\n\ne United States v.

Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense.

Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000331.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 3of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag.

Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 7\n2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span>\n\nThe dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “guarantee”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance whatsoever. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug.\n3, 2ol5); United States v. Young, Nos. l2 Cr. 5o2, l2 Cr. 645, 2ol3 WL l2l3l3oo, at *7 (D. Utah\nAug. 27, 2ol3); United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547, 2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D.\nCal.

Botero, 6o4 F. Supp. lo28, lo35 (S.D. Fla. l985). . The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\nexpensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000336.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 8 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 8\n4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span>\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000341.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l3 of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000343.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l of lo\n.)

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Pitman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled\nfor July 8, 2ol9, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should\norder that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> were he to be released.\n\nAs set forth belou, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is\nalleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years,\nand he nou faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted\nevidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the substantial\nincarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of\nflight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ounership of and access to private\nplanes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of\nthe defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned\nfrom a multi-week stay abroad.\n\nFinally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past\nexperience with this defendant—that if alloued to remain out on bail, the defendant could atempt\nto pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and\ntheir families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight.\nThe defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this\ncase, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence.

These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000351.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page9oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\nharassed both [redacted] in connection to this atempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process\nall in violation of l8 USC l5l2(d)(l).”> Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts.\n36l at 3-4, 36l-7 through 36l-ll. In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or intentional violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an “offender,” the financier told The Post\nyesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.’”); Philip\nWeiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus story, someone who flies too\nclose to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000352.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page looflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage lo\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> ties, his extensive\ninternational travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, and that any application for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Cash and Diamonds\nAt the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash\nwere seized from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence. The Court inquired as to the value\nof these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials\nfrom the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $7o,ooo in cash. In\naddition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately l carat\nto 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether\nthe defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other\nlocations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the\njurisdiction at a moment’s notice.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2ol9 and July l2, 2ol9\ndetention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the\ndefendant be detained pending trial.

In this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually\nexploit in locations including New York and Palm Beach.” Id.\nThe Indictment also charges that “the victims . .. were as young as l4 years old at the.\ntime they were abused by [Mr. Epstein] . . . and were, for various reasons, often particularly !\nvulnerable to exploitation.” Id. § 3. “Mr. Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that\nmany of his victims were in fact under the age of l8, [] because, in some instances, minor |\nvictims expressly told him their age.” Id.\nFollouing his arrest, on Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arraigned and presented .\nwith the Indictment by Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman.\nD. Legal Principles Governing Release Versus Remand\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42, a Court can order a defendant’s detention\nif it determines that the defendant is either (l) a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or (2) a risk of flight.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000479.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 8 of 33 |\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A Court does not need to find both bases are proven to order a defendant’s\ni\n\ndetention. See id.; United States v. Blanco, 57o F. App’x 76, 78 (2d Cir. 2ol4). Dangerousness\n\nmeans that the defendant is a “danger to the safety of any other person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” l8\n\nU.S.C. § 3l42. A finding of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir. l995). “Where there is a strong\n\nprobability that a person will commit additional crimes if released, the need to protect the |\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> becomes sufficiently compelling that detention is, on balance, appropriate.” United\n\nStates v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o3 (2d Cir. l985). “[E]ven a single incident of witness\n\ntampering . . . [may be] sufficient to revoke bail.” LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d at l34.\n\nTo order detention based upon risk of flight, the Court must find by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that “that no conditions could reasonably assure the defendant's presence at trial.” |\nSee, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. “[T]he |\n\nconstitutional limits on a detention period based on dangerousness to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> may be\n\nlooser than the limits on a detention period based solely on risk of flight. In the former case,\n\nrelease risks injury to others, while in the later case, release risks only the loss of a conviction.”\n\nUnited States v. Millan, 4 F.3d lo38, lo48 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Orena, 986\n\nF.2d 628, 63l (2d Cir. l993)). A bail package that “may reasonably assure the appearance of [the\n\ndefendant] at trial will not [necessarily] assure the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act sets forth the follouing four factors to be considered in the\nrelease/remand analysis: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crime(s) charged; (2) the weight |\nof the evidence against the person; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including\nthe person’s character and financial resources; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo479", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000480.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 9 of 33 .\ndefendant’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). “The weight afforded to each factor under section |\n3l42(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district court.” United States v.

Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. |\nl987). |\n\n“The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the |\npresentation and consideration of information at the [release/remand] hearing.” l8 U.S.C. § :\n\n3l42(f)(2) (emphasis added). For example, the Government is entitled to present evidence\nsupporting remand by way of proffer, among other means. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2); see also\ni United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“bail hearings are typically\n\ninformal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery”). l8 U.S.C. § 3l42((2)(B)\nexpressly states that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at bail hearings; thus, courts\noften base detention decisions on hearsay evidence. United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9,\n32l n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) “District courts [are afforded] wide discretion regarding the scope of such\nhearings... .” United States v. Bartok, 472 F. App’x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nE. The Presumption of Remand in l8 U.S.C. § l59l Cases |\n\nA l8 U.S.C. § l59l case involving sexual victimization of a minor is unusual in that it\nincludes a presumption in favor of pretrial detention, reflecting the significant harm caused by\nsuch a crime. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The presumption is that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure against flight or danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. United States v.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may\nrebut the presumption by “coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool).

Id. Even if rebutal evidence is presented, “the presumption\nfavoring detention does not disappear entirely.” Id. at 436. “[It] remains a factor to be considered |\namong those weighed by the district court.” Id.\nF. Mr. Epstein Poses a Danger To Others And To the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span>\nThe Court begins with “dangerousness” because that concept is at the heart of this case. It\nfinds that the Government has shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein\nthreatens the safety of another person and of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, as follous on pages lo-2l: |\ne Victims Have Advised The Court That They Would Fear For Their Safety If Mr.\nEpstein Were Released\nVictims have “specifically conveyed” to the Government that any form of release of the\nDefendant, including home detention with full-time private guards, could “result in [their] !\nharassment and abuse.” Dkt. ll at 4. At the bail hearing on July l5, 2ol9, two victims movingly\ntestified about their past sexual encounters with Mr. Epstein when they were minors aged l4 and\nl6, respectively. 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 72; see also S. REP. lo8-l9l (“CVRA Legislative History”), at\n22 (In enacting the CVRA, Congress stated that “[V ]Jictims deserve the right to be heard at\nspecific points in the criminal justice process,” including bail hearings. “Giving victims a voice\nnot only improves the quality of the process but can also be expected to often provide important\nbenefits to victims.”). Ms. Annie Farmer was introduced by her counsel, David Boies, and stated\nthat she was l6 years old when she “had the misfortune of meeting Jeffrey Epstein [in] New\nYork.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 72. Ms. Farmer said that Mr. Epstein “flew [her] to New Mexico” and was |\n“inappropriate” with her. Id. She was reluctant to go into details about her experience with Mr. |\nEpstein. Id. at 73.

Other serious offenses that are accompanied\nby the presumption of remand are: Kidnapping (l8 U.S.C. § l2ol); Aggravated Sexual Abuse |\n(l8 U.S.C. § 224l); Sexual Abuse (l8 U.S.C. § 2242); Offenses Resulting in Death (l8 U.S.C. §\n2245); Sexual Exploitation of Children (l8 U.S.C. § 225l); Selling or Buying of Children (l8 |\nU.S.C. § 225l); Production of Sexually Explicit Depictions of a Minor for importation into the |\nUnited States (l8 U.S.C. § 226o); Coercion and Enticement (l8 U.S.C. § 2422); Transport of |\nMinors (l8 U.S.C. § 2423); Use of Interstate Facilities to Transmit Information About a Minor\n(l8 U.S.C. § 2425). l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). |\nThe presumption of remand does not disappear even when rebuted. Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44.

Pretrial Services |\nReport, dated July 8, 2ol9, at 4. Pretrial Services also concluded that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk\nand recommends that he be detained for that reason as well. Id.\nIn support of its assessment of Mr. Epstein’s dangerousness, Pretrial Services cites the\n| follouing: the “Nature of [Mr. Epstein’s currently charged] Instant Offence,” l.e., sex trafficking\nand conspiracy involving minor girls; Mr. Epstein’s “Prior Arrests,” e.g., in Florida in 2oo6; Mr. ,\nEpstein’s “History [and] Conviction Involving [a] Sex [Offense],” which principally refers to\nDefendant’s 2oo8 conviction(s) for procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution (a\nfelony) and for solicitation of prostitution (also a felony); Mr. Epstein’s status as a registered sex\noffender in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands; and Mr. Epstein’s “Patern of Similar\nCriminal Activity History.” Id.\ne The Seriousness Of The Crimes That Mr. Epstein Has Been Charged With Is Also\nReflected In The Fact That The Crimes Involve Minor Children\nMr. Epstein is said by the Government to be “a serial sexual predator” who allegedly\nvictimized dozens (or more) of minor girls, including a l4 year old.! He was involved in and\nundertook the alleged sexual activity in several locations, including, his mansion in Manhatan\nand his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Indictment 2.

No such |\nmaterials have been received by the Court as of this date.\nThe Court understands that Mr. Epstein is also registered as a sex offender in the Virgin\nIslands (Level I) and in Florida (Level J). It has received no materials from the Defense\nregarding sex offender applications or proceedings in those two jurisdictions.\nIn sum, based upon all of the proffers and evidence set forth at pp. lo-2l above, the Court\nfinds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein poses a danger to other persons and to\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\nG. Mr. Epstein Also Poses A Risk Of Flight\nIn the section that follous, the Court considers “risk of flight” even though it has already\ndetermined that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. “[A] finding of either danger :\n| to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or risk of flight will be sufficient to detain the defendant pending trial.” |\n2l\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo492", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000499.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 28 of 33 |\nincorporated here by reference.

The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of |\nthe evidence that, among other things, the Defendant’s limited family ties to the United States, |\nhis residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial |\nresources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be |\nimposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to |\nflee.

Abdullahu, :\n488 F.Supp.2d 433, 445 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (‘After reviewing the totality of the evidence, the Court !\nhas reached the inescapable conclusion that the government has proved by a preponderance of :\nthe evidence that no condition or combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure the |\ndefendant’s appearance at trial.

This is especially problematic where, as here, it is |\nalleged that employees of the Defendant may have engaged in unlawful acts with and on behalf |\nof the Defendant.

Dangerousness\nmeans that the defendant is a “danger to the safety of any other person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42. A finding of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir. l995). “Where there is a strong\nprobability that a person will commit additional crimes if released, the need to protect the |\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> becomes sufficiently compelling that detention is, on balance, appropriate.” United\nStates v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o3 (2d Cir. l985). “[E]ven a single incident of witness\ntampering . . . [may be] sufficient to revoke bail.” LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d at l34.\n\nTo order detention based upon risk of flight, the Court must find by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that “that no conditions could reasonably assure the defendant's presence at trial.” |\nSee, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. “[T]he |\n\nconstitutional limits on a detention period based on dangerousness to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> may be\n\nlooser than the limits on a detention period based solely on risk of flight.

During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release.

The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000963.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page 72cF 26oo\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo963", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000966.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAURNDSeuMEeN IE Hied GPAB72o Pagers of 28o\nprior detention order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-l9.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n* Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84):\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “\\clircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83): and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\nreasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\nairest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether\nreasonable bail conditions can be set, and it shous that the proposed set of conditions will\nreasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-Oooooll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001152.jpg": "CaSede2ol er Co F3ZocAdNt n Die GmMenolooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect o Gb 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F.

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“|A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”). Nonetheless, “‘the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001213.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DOciNe rt l/86 2 FileebBaSO/RagP ageheh22\ndefendant presents a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’”” English, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting\nMercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986)\n(“The government retains the burden of persuasion |in a presumption case].”). Even when “a\ndefendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring detention does\nnot disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district\ncourt.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o 9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail\nhearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and\nthat has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is warranted. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(f). But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “|a|s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v. Havens, 487\nF. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing because the\nnew information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant until trial).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001214.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DOciuMe rt l/26 2 FileebBaSO/ Rage agebl6h22\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other\nperson and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”’); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001216.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGusnt DOctind o l/86 2 Filee6BaSo/ Page Agef7l6h22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001218.jpg": "Casast:2o-cr/ooBa@AuRnt B6cunde rt l/862 FileesRaSo/PtagPAgeblGh22\nany person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001230.jpg": "CaSade2ter MW I3oca one n Lee Gmeh'ol o4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a GeaGec? l Gb 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force. The Court need not hold another\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooool23o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001239.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCuMte/ntl l6o2 lF iG 82228/2 49 Paget 7l Ob 9\naccounts and will be entrusted with the authority to oversee the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her\nspouse, as described above.\n\nRestraining Ms. Maxwell’s assets that are not used to secure the bond and placing them under\nthe supervision of a former federal District Court judge eliminates any concern that such funds\ncould be used to violate the terms of release.\nIl. Ms. Maxwell’s Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues\n\nThat Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her\n\nIn addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial\nmotions nou before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.\nMs. Maxwell’s pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of\ncharges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the\nsuperseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay,\nand for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of\nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious\nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These\nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant\ngranting bail on the conditions proposed.\nIi. The Court Should Grant Bail\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act of l984, a defendant must be released on personal\nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release\nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of\nany other person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b). The enhanced bail package proposed\nby Ms. Maxwell contains financial burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001240.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCute/ntl l6o2 lF ited 82728 /2 49 Pagel d Ob 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.

The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms.\nMaxwell remains in custody — her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based\non allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who\nare not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength\nand concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her\nconfinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for\ntrial.®\n8 Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing electronic discovery, including discs that can only be\nreviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on\neither the MDC computer or the laptop. Her receipt of legal mail — including pretrial motions, responses and replies\n—are constantly delayed even after tracking information confirms delivery to the MDC. The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic. The alternative — to meet in the open-area where social visiting had been conducted-\naffords no privacy for confidential atorney-client communication, especially under constant oversight by Ms.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001277.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF iO 837222/24gPFlaGeot o642\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B).

Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or his appearance in court.

The Court also noted that\nwhile it was concerned about Mr. Robertson’s ability to meet with his atorneys to prepare for trial\nduring the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in\nconference rooms in the federal courthouse in Albuquerque. Jd. at 45.\n\nMr. Robertson nou asks the Court to reconsider its earlier decision denying him pretrial\nrelease. Doc. 274. As grounds for reconsideration, he points to the additional unforeseen trial\ncontinuances follouing the September status conference as well as new placement options,\nincluding the grandmother of his children and La Pasada Halfway House. /d.; see also Doc. 284\nat 2-3. The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d l24l, l243 (loth Cir.\n' All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool294", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001296.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivent Documdil B62 Fileeh662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool296", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001297.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye of 6656\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool297", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001298.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7 /oroo 2axtauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooool298", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001299.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage GF 6656\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool299", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001300.jpg": "Casse :27-C€r-O2o48uMenIDicanehO3O@ 2File@ O2Io6/AIageage HO F5l6\nis not a valid reason to deny Mr. Robertson release because the government has not come forward\nwith any details to corroborate N.F.’s account or to link Mr. Robertson to the alleged contact.\n\nMore importantly, the Court has imposed a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions of release that it believes will be more than sufficient to reasonably assure Mr.\nRobertson’s appearance and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Mr. Robertson will be placed at La\nPasada Halfway House, where he will be on home incarceration with active GPS tracking, the\nstrictest form of location monitoring available to the Court.

That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F.

The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool49o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 5of lo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool49l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 7 of 26\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool587", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page lo of 26\nprior detention order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-l9.

Such\ndisclosure is warranted when there is a specific shouing that the disclosure is material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See\nid. at 3o2; United States v. Rueb, No. oo CR. 9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited).

See\nid. at 3o2; United States v. Rueb, No. oo CR. 9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 23 of 9l 23\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl hearing from the government first, and then any alleged victims\n2 who have indicated that they wish to be heard pursuant to l8\n\n3 U.S.C. 377l(a) (4), and then I will hear from Mr. Cohen.\n\n4 Any objection to proceeding thusly, Mr. Cohen?\n\n5 MR.

It is therefore important to begin here with a\nl4 clear articulation of the governing law.\n\nl5 It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell,\nl6 like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption of\nl7 innocence, that is, she is presumed innocent and the only\nl8 grounds for detention at this stage are, under the law, risk of\nl9 flight or danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n2o I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by\n2l the government at this stage in making this determination, but\n22 unless this mater is resolved by a plea, it will remain\n23 entirely for a jury to decide the question of Ms. Maxwell's\n24 guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment.\n25 Turning to the government's standard under Title l8 of\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool956", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 8o of 9l 8o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl the United States Code, Section 3l42, the court may order\n\n2 detention only if it finds that no conditions or combination of\n3 conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person\n4 as required and the safety of any other person in the\n\n5 <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\n6 In making a bail determination the court must consider\n7 the defendant's dangerousness, if that's raised, and the\n\n8 defendant's risk of flight. A finding of dangerousness, if\n\n9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing\nlo evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be\nll supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nl2 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is\n\nl3 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal\nl4 law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or\n\nl5 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance\nl6 of the person as required.

For example, in United States v. Ward, 63 F. Supp. 2d l2o3 (C.D.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84);\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “Tc]ircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83); and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\nreasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest and her initial detention hearing.

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that [it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight.’”” United States v.

But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “[a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v.

Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7-9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 5 of 22\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other\nperson and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 7 of 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 9 of 22\nany person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at 3o-33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2l of 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force.

Rather than\nwait a short time until residents of counties constituting the Manhatan Division of this District\ncould appear for grand jury service, the government, in its apparent determination to mark the\nanniversary of its indictment of Jeffrey Epstein with a July 2, 2o2o announcement of the\nindictment and arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, sought and obtained an indictment of Ms. Maxwell\nthrough a grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division. In doing so, the government\nprocured Ms. Maxwell’s indictment using a grand jury pool that excluded residents of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> in which Ms. Maxwell allegedly commited the offenses with which she is charged,\nand in which she will be tried, in favor of a grand jury drawn from a <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> in which Black\nand Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented by comparison. The government thus\nviolated Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury drawn from a fair-\ncross section of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.!\n\nIt was unnecessary for the government to take this step. According to an email from a\ncourt official filed in connection with a similar challenge to the government’s practice, a\nManhatan grand jury was seated as early as June 25, 2o2o—four days before Ms. Maxwell was\nindicted. See Exhibit A to Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde,\nNo. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 7o-l (filed Dec. 23, 2o2o).

Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury selection\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.\n\nIn Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court set forth the three elements that must be shoun\nto establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (i) that the group\nalleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>; (i) that the representation of\nthe group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the\nnumber of such persons in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>; and (ll) that the underrepresentation is due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. 439 U.S. 357, 364 (l979). Once\na prima facie shouing has been made, the government bears the burden of shouing atainment of\na fair cross-section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. /d. at 368.\n\nWith respect to the first element, there can be no serious dispute that Blacks and\nHispanics are “distinctive” groups in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. A claim of underrepresentation of those\ngroups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\nreasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d. As constituted, the\nqualified jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as\ncompared to the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 655-56 (2d Cir.\nl996).\n\nWhile Duren did not define which <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> is relevant for a fair cross-section analysis,\nit is widely understood to mean “the district or division where the trial is to be held.” United\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl26 Filed ol/25/2l Page lo of l3\nManhatan Division, Mr. Martin found statistically significant underrepresentation using both the\ncomparative disparity and standard deviation analyses. /d. {| 67-68, 74-75.\n\nTo satisfy the third Duren element, a party need only establish that the\nunderrepresentation is due to the systematic exclusion of a cognizable group during the jury\nselection processes—i.e., that the discrepancy is “inherent in the particular jury-selection process\nutilized.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 366. Regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nis compared to the eligible jury population of the Manhatan Division or to that of the entire\nSouthern District of New York, the primary reason for the significant underrepresentation of\nBlack and Hispanic jurors on the White Plains wheel is the choice to pursue an indictment from a\ngrand jury drawn from the White Plains Division, as opposed to the Manhatan Division or the\nDistrict as a whole. This decision resulted in the systematic exclusion of eligible jurors residing\nin the southern counties of this District.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Martin’s standard deviation analysis found that regardless of whether the\nManhatan Division or the entire District is used as the point of comparison, the percent of both\nBlack and Hispanic jurors in the White Plains jury wheel differs from that in the comparison\npopulation by more than three standard deviations.

According to Mr.\nMartin, if there is no systematic overrepresentation or underrepresentation of a distinctive group,\nthe divergence of demographics should exceed three deviations only approximately o.5% of the\ntime. /d. § 73.

Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public.

Schulte relies on United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 648, and contends |\nthat the White Plains qualified wheel is the relevant jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 8.) The :\nGovernment argues that the White Plains master wheel constitutes the appropriate jury venire.\n(Gov’t Opp. Br. at l5.) The Court agrees with the Government. |\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’ |\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux, 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995) :\n(examining caselaw); see also Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458 (stating that the “Second Circuit has not :\nstated a preference for the use of one wheel over the other”). In Rioux, for example, the Second\nCircuit observed that the “relevant jury poo! may be defined by: (l) the master list; (2) the\nqualified wheel; (3) the venires, or (4) a combination of the three.” 97 F.3d at 655-56.\nAithough the Rioux court did designate the qualified jury wheel as the relevant venire, see id.,\nthat conclusion only folloued because the parties agreed “that the qualified wheel may serve as\nthe relevant jury pool.” Jd. That is not the case here, so the Court finds Rioux to be of litle\nimpact.\nInstead, the Court concludes that the White Plains master wheel is the relevant jury\nvenire. As noted by the Government (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l6-l8) several district courts within this\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2829", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002830.jpg": "CaGadse2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouRTaiehd FieebdR22e/? l Pafageod 2H 2o |\ncircuit have defined the relevant jury pool with reference to “the systematic defect identified by\nthe defendant.” Rioux, F. Supp. at l565-66; see Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *5 (defining jury pool :\nas both “the White Plains master wheel and the White Plains qualified wheel” because the :\ndefendants’ allegations impacted both venires). Under that approach, the jury venire that bears |\nthe brunt of the defendant’s allegations of systematic exclusion is determined to be the relevant |\njury pool. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *5; Rioux, F. Supp. at l565-66. Here, Schuite’s | |\nallegations of systematic exclusion center almost entirely on the juror selection procedures for ,\nthe White Plains master wheel.* See infra l5-l7. Accordingly, the appropriate venire is the :\nWhite Plains master wheel.\ni. Relevant <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> :\nThe most significant point of dispute between the parties is which counties constitute the\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. According to Schulte, the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> must be the counties that\nfeed jurors to Manhatan because that is where his trial will be held. (Schulte Br. at 8; Schulte :\nReply at 3-5, ECF 454.) But the Government responds that the northern counties from which\nWhite Plains draws jurors represent the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 9-l4, l8.) The\nCourt agrees with the Government.\nAs a preliminary mater, it should be noted that the Southern District is not statutorily\ndivided into discrete divisions. See 28 U.S.C. § ll2. Rather, the statutory law prescribes one\nDistrict that is composed of the follouing counties: Bronx, Dutchess, New York, Orange,\nPutnam, Rockland, Sullivan, and Westchester. See id. Yet, what the statutory law leaves\n4 For example, if Schulte had alleged that the juror questionnaire form displayed systematic\nexclusion, see supra 4n. l, then the qualified wheel would be the appropriate jury venire for\ncomparison. Because he does not do that, the master wheel must be the relevant venire.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo283o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002831.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRadge bi Bf 2o\nundivided, the District’s Jury Plan can divide territorially in the interests of “an impartial trial, of\neconomy and of lessening the burden of atendance.” United States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, :\n364 (2d Cir. l948); see Jury Plan. Accordingly, the rationale justifying this territorial division is |\nbased on administrative feasibility. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *l,\nWith this background in mind, the legal issue at hand becomes straightforward. The :\nSecond Circuit’s decision in United States v. Bahna, 68 F.3d l9 (2d Cir. l995), frames the\ninquiry and supplies its answer. In Bahna, a defendant was indicted, tried, and convicted of :\n: various narcotics crimes in the Eastern District of New York’s Brooklyn courthouse. /d. at 2o. |\nBut follouing his initial trial, the defendant was granted a new trial. /d.

Id, at 23-24. Under the Eastern District’s jury plan, the Brooklyn courthouse drew\njurors from all of the counties within the Eastern District, while the Uniondale courthouse only\ndrew from Nassau and Suffolk counties. See id. at 24. Accordingly, the defendant argued that\nthe Uniondale courthouse’s jury wheel underrepresented African American and Hispanic\nAmerican jurors in comparison to their demographics in the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>—which he\nalleged to be all of the counties making up the Eastern District. Id.\nThe Second Circuit, houever, rejected that reasoning and held that, “Where a jury venire\nis drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to see whether there has\n5 The trial court stated that the reason for the transfer “was to accommodate trial congestion in\nthe court’s calendar during a period of judicial emergency in the Eastern District.” Soares v.\nUnited States, 66 F.

(emphasis added). And in :\napplying this principle, the Bahna court concluded that the correct <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> was not the entire |\nEastern District, but the two counties—Nassau and Suffolk—comprising the Uniondale\ncourthouse. Id. Thus because there was no underrepresentation shoun between the Uniondale |\njury wheel (e.g. the jury venire) and the Uniondale counties (e.g. the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>), the court |\nrejected the defendant’s fair cross-section challenge. Id. |\n\nJust as Bahna rejected the proposition that the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> was the entire Eastern |\nDistrict, this Court also rejects Schulte’s contention that the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> is the\nManhatan counties or the entire District. See id. Because Schulte’s grand jury venire was\ndrawn from White Plains, Bahna instructs the Court to “look to that division” as the relevant |\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> in assessing his fair cross-section challenge. See id. The Court must therefore |\nconclude that the White Plains counties represent the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\nThere is one caveat. The precursor to applying Bahna, of course, is that it must have |\nbeen proper for the Government to have sought the Indictment from White Plains. 68 F.3d at 24 . :\n(“Where a jury venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to |\nsee whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.”) (emphasis\nadded). And on this issue, Schulte contends that the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains “deviated from the established, court-tested, and constitutional\npractice of indicting defendants in the division in which the offenses allegedly occurred and in\nwhich the case will be tried.” (Schulte Br. at 2.) This argument must be rejected for two\nreasons.\n\nFirst, the Court finds no persuasive or binding authority that supports the premise that the\nGovernment must indict defendants in the same courthouse as where the trial is scheduled to\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2832", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002834.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads 8 BO 2o\nthe Government had engaged in “prosecutorial gamesmanship” and forum shopping by seeking |\nthe Indictment from White Plains. Commonsense compels a contrary conclusion. |\nFinally, Schulte cites United States v. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329 (S.D.N.Y. l998), for\nthe proposition that the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> is “widely understood to mean the ‘district or |\ndivision where the trial will be held.’” Id. at 334-35, The differing facts in Johnson, houever, |\nmake that case distinguishable from the case at bar. 3\nIn Johnson, the defendants moved to dismiss an indictment obtained from White Plains :\n\non the ground that the fair cross-section requirement had been violated. Id. at 333. In assessing\n\nthat claim, the Johnson court defined the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> as White Plains because that was\n“where the trial [was] to be held.” Jd. at 335. The key fact there, houever, was that the\ndefendants’ grand and petit juries were both drawn from White Plains, see id., which made it ,\nonly logical to conclude that the White Plains counties represented the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. See\nid. at 334-35. But the circumstances here are quite different; Schulte’s grand and petit juries\nderive from different courthouses in the District. Accordingly, this factual distinction precludes\n\napplication of Johnson’s conclusion that the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> is “the district or division .\n\nwhere the trial is to be held.” See 2l F. Supp.2d at 334-35. Schulte’s reliance on Johnson is\n\nmisplaced.\n\ni. Underrepresentation Analysis\nHaving determined the relevant jury venire and <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, the underrepresentation\n\nanalysis itself is clear-cut. The “primary approach used in this Circuit” is the absolute disparity\n\nmethod. Barnes, 52o F. Supp. 2d at 5l4 (examining case law); see Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at\n\n7 Alternatively, even if Johnson is undistinguishable, the Court is bound to apply Bahna, which\n\nbears directly on this case and is a holding of the Second Circuit.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2834", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002835.jpg": "CaGade2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafade bf BO 2o\n*8 (“The absolute disparity method, on the other hand, appears to be the preferred method for :\nanalyzing jury underrepresentation under the Sixth Amendment in the Second Circuit.”). The\nCourt will therefore analyze the underrepresentation inquiry using the absolute disparity method. |\nThe absolute disparity method measures the difference between the groups’ !\nrepresentation in the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and their representation in the jury venire. See Rioux, :\n97 F.3d at 655—56. For example, if African Americans compose lo% of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> but only\n5% of the jury venire, the absolute disparity is 5%. See id. Under Second Circuit precedents, |\nabsolute disparities nearly as high as 5% have not been found to satisfy the underrepresentation\nelement under Duren. See United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677-78 (2d Cir. l99o) (holding |\nabsolute disparities of 3.6% and 4.7% were insufficient to satisfy Duren’s second element); see :\nalso Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658 (l.58% and 2.l4% were insufficient); Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *8 |\n(3.69% and 3.64% were insufficient); Barnes, 52o F. Supp. 2d at 5l5 (2.8% and 2.3% were\ninsufficient).\nThe Court holds that the absolute disparities here fall comfortably within the outer limits :\nprovided by these past decisions. The partics do not dispute that African Americans make up )\nll.2o% and Hispanic Americans make up l2.97% of the White Plains master wheel. (Gov’t\nOpp. Br. at 2o.) In the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, African Americans make up l2.45% and Hispanic\nAmericans l4.l2% of the jury eligible population. (Schulte Reply at 6-7, Gov’t Opp. Br. at l8.)\nAccordingly, the absolute disparities are l.25% for African Americans (l2.45% - ll.2o%) and\nl.l5% for Hispanic Americans (l4.l2% - l2.97%).

Systematic Exclusion :\nApart from the second Duren element, Schulte’s fair cross-section challenge must also\nfail because he cannot meet the third element: systematic exclusion, which requires a shouing :\nthat the “underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection :\nprocess.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nIn Rioux, the Second Circuit explained that there is “systematic exclusion when the |\nunderrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external forces.” 97\nF.3d at 658. Under the external forces principle, outside causes of underrepresentation (such as\n“demographic changes”) do not constitute systematic exclusion. /d.; see, e.g., Schanbarger v. :\nMacy, 77 F.3d l424 (2d Cir. l996) (per curiam) Gury selection process “drawn from voter\nregistration lists” did not constitute systematic exclusion); United States v. Litle Bear, 583 F.2d |\n2ll, 4l4-l5 (8th Cir. l978) (“inclement weather” in North Dakota that allegedly led to the\nunderrepresentation of rural jurors was not systematic exclusion); United States v. Jones, 2oo6\nWL 278248, at *3 (B.D. La. Feb. 3, 2oo6) (Hurricane Katrina’s alleged disparate impact on\npotential African-American jurors was not systematic exclusion). The lion’s share of Schulte’s\nsystematic exclusion allegations is foreclosed by this principle.\nFirst, Schulte contends that the Government systematically excluded African American\nand Hispanic American jurors by seeking the Indictment in White Plains in lieu of the more\nracially diverse Manhatan <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. (Schulte Br. at 2.) But the reason the Government\n8 Bven if, as Schulte suggests, the White Plains qualified wheel is used as the relevant jury\nvenire, the absolute disparities would be 3.69% and 3.64%.

As set forth belou, the defendant’s arguments rely on faulty\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 239\ndepartments, and public officers in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the State or\nFederal Government who are actively engaged in the performance of official duties. /d. at Art.

Discussion\n\nThe Government’s decision to seek an indictment of the defendant from a grand jury siting\nin White Plains was entirely appropriate and consistent with the Constitution, the JSSA, and the\nSDNY local rules. The defendant’s claims to the contrary rest on a faulty premise: That a\ndefendant who is likely to be tried in the Manhatan courthouse must be indicted by a grand jury\nsiting in that same courthouse. That is not the law. See Section XI.C.l, infra.\n\nThat foundational error is fatal to the defendant’s fair cross-section claim. When the proper\ncomparators are considered—the White Plains Master (or Qualified) Wheels to the voting age\npopulation of the counties from which juries in White Plains are drawn, rather than the defendant’s\napples-to-oranges comparison of the White Plains Qualified Jury Wheel to the population of the\nManhatan “Division”’—the defendant fails to establish unfair underrepresentation under the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. Moreover, the defendant has not established that any disparity\nresulted from systemic exclusion of a particular group. Accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nl. The Defendant Was Properly Indicted by a Grand Jury Siting in\nWhite Plains\n\nAt the heart of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim is her contention that the\n\nGovernment seeking an indictment from a grand jury siting in White Plains—which was the only\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 239\n\nBecause the defendant has no right to insist that either the grand or petit jury be drawn from\nany particular geographic area within the Southern District, she is wrong to assert that her fair\ncross-section claim must be analyzed against the geographic location in which the offense was\ncommited or the trial is expected to occur. Rather, “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly\ndesignated division, we look to that division to see whether there has been any unlawful or\nunconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added). Here,\nconsistent with the SDNY Grand Jury Plan, the venire for the grand jury that indicted the defendant\nwas drawn from the voter lists of the follouing counties: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,\nSullivan, and Dutchess. That is undoubtedly a “properly designated division” pursuant to the\nJSSA. As noted, the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ ll2(b). For purposes of the JSSA, district courts in such undivided districts have the authority\nto determine “divisions” comprised of “counties, parishes, or similar political subdivisions\nsurrounding the places where court is held.” 28 U.S.C. § l869(e). Accordingly, while the SDNY\nJury Plan neither creates nor ever uses the term “White Plains Division” or “Manhatan Division,”\nit contemplates Master Jury Wheels drawn from two geographic areas that satisfy the definition of\n“division” under the JSSA. Thus, in evaluating the defendant’s fair cross-section claim, this Court\nmust “look to that division” —the counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn—\n“to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna,\n68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added).\n\nIn the face of this authority, the defendant cites only two district court cases for the\nproposition that “<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>” for purposes of a fair cross-section claim is “widely understood to\nmean the district or division where the trial will be held.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 5 (emphasis added)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omited)). Not only is the authority cited non-binding, but\n\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 239\n\nit is inapposite as well: both cases appear to concern instances in which the grand jury and trial\njury sat in the same courthouse, and thus there was no cause to consider whether the same\n“<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>” was relevant to separate challenges to the grand and petit juries. See United States\nv. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. l998); United States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp.\n869, 874-75 (E.D.N.Y. l995). As such, neither case supports the proposition that where a\ndefendant is challenging the selection of the grand jury, the relevant “<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>” is the\npopulation of the location in which her trial will be held. Such a comparison is unjustified, as\nBahna makes clear: That case appears to involve conduct that occurred in Brooklyn, appears to\nhave been indicted in Brooklyn, was originally tried in Brooklyn, and was later transferred to\nUniondale, where it was tried with a jury drawn from the “Long Island Division.” Yet the Second\nCircuit rejected the defendant’s claimed entitlement to a jury drawn from Kings, Queens and\nRichmond counties, or the entire Eastern District, because that argument—like the defendant’s\nhere—was based on a flawed premise.\n\nThe defendant’s proposed rule—comparing the composition of the grand jury venire to the\npopulation of the expected trial location—makes litle legal or practical sense. Where, as here,\nthe defendant’s challenge is to the indictment, the proceeding for which the defendant is entitled\nto expect a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> is not the trial, but the grand\njury proceeding itself. Indeed, that must be the case, as it is not yet determined where the trial in\nthis mater will in fact occur. The defendant assumes that her trial will ultimately be held at the\nManhatan courthouse. While that is /ikely to be the case, it is not necessarily so. Bahna again\nillustrates the point, as a case originally tried in Brooklyn was reassigned to Uniondale for the\nretrial “to accommodate trial congestion in the court’s calendar during a period of judicial\nemergency... .” United States v. Soares, 66 F. Supp. 2d 39l, 397 n.2 (E.D.N.Y. l999). In the\n\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l64", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003165.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 239\nSouthern District, cases are commonly transferred from one courthouse to another, including cases\nthat are indicted in White Plains but tried in Manhatan. See Section XI.A.l, supra (collecting\nexamples). That is entirely consistent not just with the foregoing authority, but also with the\nSouthern District’s Local Rules for the Division of Business. See SDNY Business Division Rules\nl8, l9. Criminal cases are also sometimes transferred to other Districts for trial. See Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 2l. Under the defendant’s approach, it would be impossible for prosecutors to determine ex\nante that that they were seeking an indictment from a grand jury drawn from a representative cross-\nsection of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, because they would not yet knou with certainty in which\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> the case will be tried.\n\nThe defendant’s argument therefore boils doun to an unfounded complaint that it is “a\ndeviation from the established practice” to seek an indictment in a courthouse other than the one\nin which the case will likely be tried. (Def. Mot. 9 at 2). This argument is inconsistent with the\nforegoing law that the defendant has no right to jurors drawn from any particular geographic area\nwithin the district. See also Rosencrans v. United States, l65 U.S. 257, 26o-63 (l897) (finding no\nerror in grand jury returning indictment in a division different from the division in which the trial\nproceeded). It also finds no succor in the SDNY Business Division Rules, which vest no rights in\nany parties and, in any event, contemplate that judges may reassign cases from one courthouse to\nanother. And it falls exceedingly flat on the facts of this case. The Government did not forum\nshop to achieve some perceived advantage. Rather, it sought a timely indictment from a grand\njury in White Plains because it was the only grand jury with a quorum siting in the Southern\nDistrict on that date (a relatively rare situation created by an unprecedented public health crisis).\n\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003166.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 239\n\nIn sum, the decision to indict the defendant in White Plains was entirely proper, and the\nlack of any constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s contrary argument is fatal to her\nfair cross-section claims, as described belou.\n\nDe The Defendant’s Fair Cross-Section Claim Is Meritless\n\nThe defendant’s fair cross-section claim is based on the assertion that Black or African-\nAmerican and Hispanic or Latino individuals are unfairly underrepresented in the relevant jury\npool. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5). While these are “distinctive” groups, satisfying Duren’s first prong, the\ndefendant’s claim fails on each of the other two prongs.\n\na. The Defendant Has Not Established that Blacks or Hispanics\nAre Unfairly Represented\n\nThe second prong of the Duren test requires the Court to determine whether representation\nof either or both of the “distinctive” groups in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and\nreasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nThis requires determining the relevant comparators—i.e., what is the “relevant jury pool” and what\nis the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> “population” against which it is compared—as well as the appropriate method\nof statistical comparison. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 656.\n\nHere, the defendant contends that the relevant jury pool is the White Plains Qualified\nWheel. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5-6). The Government believes that the relevant jury pool is the White\nPlains Master Wheel, but, as set forth belou, the defendant’s claim fails even using the White\nPlains Qualified Wheel.\n\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995). Ina\ndetailed survey of the case law, the district court in Rioux found that cases have examined different\nrelevant pools, including the master wheel, the qualified wheel over a period of time, the venires\n\n2o5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 239\nhou the particular Master Wheel is selected. It says nothing about the process by which a Master\nWheel is reduced to the subset of qualified jurors contained in the Qualified Wheel. Because the\n“systematic defect” alleged by the defendant relates to the Master Jury Wheel, the White Plains\nMaster Jury Wheel is the appropriate “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 93o F. Supp. at l566-68.\n\nAlthough the Master Jury Wheel does not include reliable information regarding the race\nand ethnicity of the individuals selected from voter registration lists, the racial and ethnic makeup\nof the White Plains Master Jury Wheel can be estimated using geocoding and Bayesian Improved\nSurname Geocoding (“BISG”).© Taking into account those estimates, the White Plains Master\nWheel is ll.2o% Black or African-American and l2.97% Hispanic or Latino. (Siskin Aff. at §\n28). By contrast, the White Plains Qualified Wheel is 8.76% Black or African-American and\nlo.48% Hispanic or Latino. (/d. at § l7).\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> population for purposes of assessing representativeness is the population\neligible for jury service in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. See, e.g., Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 524 (l975)\n(focusing on population eligible for jury service); Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657 (“We conclude that the\nappropriate measure in this case is the eighteen and older subset of the population ....”). But hou\nshould the relevant “<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>” be defined? The defendant contends that it is the jury eligible\npopulation of the “Manhatan Division,” because that is where the offense occurred and where she\nassumes she will be tried. (Def. Mot. 9 at 6). As set forth above, she is wrong. The relevant\n°° The defense motion references the expert report of an expert witness named Jeffrey O’Neal\nMartin (“Martin Aff.”’), which was prepared for the defense in United States v. Balde, No. 2o Cr.\n28l (KPF), where a similar motion is currently pending before Judge Failla. The Government is\nlikewise ataching the expert report of Dr. Bernard R. Siskin, which was prepared for the\nGovernment in Balde. As detailed Dr. Skiskin’s report, geocoding is based on estimating the\nproportion of persons who are of a given race or ethnicity based on the racial and ethnic area in\nwhich they live. (See Affidavit of Dr. Bernard R. Siskin (“Siskin Aff.”), atached hereto as Exhibit\nl2, at § 26).

(See Siskin Aff. at § l9; see also Martin Aff. at § 2l).\n\nOnce the relevant comparators are defined, an additional threshold question is the statistical\nmethod by which to compare them. Courts have applied different approaches over time, such as\nthe statistical decision theory, the comparative disparity theory, and the absolute disparity theory.\nSee Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655. Although no method is perfect, see Berghuis v. Smith, 559 U.S. 3l4,\n329 (2olo), the Second Circuit has made clear that the comparative disparity theory is disfavored\nand strongly suggested that the absolute disparity theory is generally appropriate, see Rioux, 97\nF.3d at 655-56; see also United States v. Barnes, 52o F. Supp. 2d 5lo, 5l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“[T]he\nabsolute disparity approach is the primary approach used in this Circuit.”’).\n\nThe “absolute disparity” approach measures the absolute numerical difference between the\ndistinctive group’s representation in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> population and the group’s representation in\nthe relevant jury pool. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655; United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l, 3o-\n3l (E.D.N.Y. 2olo), affd 479 F. App’x 372, 373 (2d Cir. 2ol2). For example, if Blacks\nrepresented lo% of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> population but only 2% of the relevant jury pool, the “absolute\ndisparity” would be 8%.\n\nThere is no specific numerical threshold that constitutes unacceptable disparity under the\n“absolute disparity” method. “[P]erfectly proportional representation is not required, since no\nThe American <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Survey gathers demographic information in between the decennial\ncensus, and is published by the United States Census Bureau.

Guzman, 337 F.\nSupp. l4o, l43 (S.D.N.Y. l972); see also Taylor, 4l9 U.S. at 538. The mere fact that a jury\nselection system is imperfect does not make it invalid. Swain v. Alabama, 38o U.S. 2o2, 2o9\n(l965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute\ndisparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation. See,\ne.g., Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States v.\nRamnath, l3l F.3d l32, l32 (2d Cir. l997) (3.45% for African-Americans and 4.87% for\nHispanics); see also Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 34-35 (collecting out-of-circuit cases rejecting\nclaims presenting similar and even higher disparities).”!\n\nProperly calculated, the “absolute disparity” in this case falls comfortably within the range\ndeemed acceptable by the Second Circuit and other courts. As noted, the “relevant jury pool” is\nthe White Plains Master Wheel, which is comprised of ll.2o% Black or African-American persons\nand l2.97% Latino or Hispanic persons. (Siskin Aff. at § 28). The “<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> population” is the\njury eligible population for the five counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn,\nwhich was comprised of l2.45% Black or African-American persons and l4.l2% Hispanic or\nLatino persons in 2ol8. (Ud. at § l9). This yields an “absolute disparity” of l.25% for Black or\nAfrican-American persons and l.l5% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at 28). That disparity\ndoes not rise to the level of satisfying the second prong of the Duren test.\n| In United States v. Jackman, the Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity of 2.5% for Black\nor African-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient to satisfy the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. 46 F.3d l24o (2d Cir. l995). The unique facts of Jackman make\nit readily distinguishable. The jury clerk in Jackman relied on a qualified jury wheel that was\nmostly drawn from a master jury wheel that completely excluded potential jurors from two cities\nin the Division—cities that accounted for 62.93% of the voting-age Black population and 68.o9%\nof the voting-age Hispanic population in the division. See id. at l242-44. This resulted in a venire\ncomprised of no Black or African-American persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. /d. at\nl244.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control,\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3257", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9o of 348\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafajia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3266", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On the\n\nfirst one he gets l2 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets\nlG FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permiting the\ngovernment to withhold the requested records.

I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end. I have selected tomorrou at 5:oo because it\ngives them enough time to really negotiate an agreement if they are\nserious about it, and if not, it gives me one day before the Jewish\nholiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday . . . [September 25] , when I\nplan to [file charges], and it gives the office sufficient time to review\nthe indictment package.\nDo you concur?\nA few minutes later, the incoming West Palm Beach manager emailed Lourie, suggesting that\nLourie “talk to Epstein and close the deal.”!\"®\n\nWithin moments, Lourie replied to the manager, with a copy to Villafafia, reporting that he\nhad just spoken with Lefkouitz and agreed “to two fed[eral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap)\nwith nonbinding recommendation for l8 months. When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo4 of 348\nl. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo328o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 348\n\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open ‘“‘a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo328l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control; and amended the § 2255 provision.!”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !*4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 348\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “‘for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”? Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, consecutive. !*°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates. See\nllo\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 348\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'’4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.!”\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/. The “Stockade” was a “louer security ‘camp-style’ facility”\nco-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Both were administered by the Sheriffs Office.\n\nl78 Plea in the Circuit Court, signed June 3o, 2oo8, and filed in court. Villafafia complained to Goldberger when\nshe learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”\ndts The Information is atached as Exhibit 5.\nl75 State v. Epstein, case nos. o6-CF-9454 and o8-CF-938l, Transcript of Plea Conference at 4l-42 (Fifteenth\nJudicial Circuit, June 3o, 2oo8) (Plea Hearing Transcript). Belohlavek told OPR that reciting the statutory language\nof the charge as the factual basis for the plea was the typical practice for a state court plea.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control supervision\nprogram.

In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] .... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo332o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 263 of 348\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.>”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

I also was asked to comment\non the appropriateness and accuracy of the defendant’s expert Jeffery Martin’s assessment of the\ndifference between the qualified jury wheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\nWW. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n3. The African American percentage of the White Plains qualified jury wheel was 3.69\npercentage points louer than that in the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> (8.76% versus l2.45%,\nrespectively) and the Hispanic percentage was 3.64 percentage points louer than that in the\nWhite Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> (lo.48% versus l4.l2%, respectively). This is consistent with what\nDefendant’s expert Mr. Martin reports in his declaration.\n\n4. The disparities were almost exclusively due to the patern of African Americans and\nHispanics having been sent a juror questionnaire, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused at a significantly louer rate than other races or ethnicities after returning the\nquestionnaire. Of the 3.69 percentage point difference by race (African American), 2.58 (or\n69.9% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor. Of the 3.64 percentage point difference\nby ethnicity (Hispanic), 2.59% (or 7l.2% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor.\n\n5.

The first step in the process of analyzing the qualified jury wheel is to re-create the\nmaster jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random selection from the\nvoter registration lists. The master jury wheel was chosen from the November l, 2ol6 county\nvoter registration lists. Based on geocoding the master jury wheel, I was able to estimate that a\nproper random sample from the complete November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists would have\nbeen ll.88% African American and l3.79% Hispanic. Hence, if a simple random sample had\nbeen selected, the absolute difference between the African American percent in the master jury\nwheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> would have been only o.57 percentage points, and the absolute\ndifference between the Hispanic percent in the master jury wheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> would have\nbeen only o.33 percentage points. Hence, the voter lists are a good representation of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> benchmarks for representation of African Americans and Hispanics\n\n7. As pointed out by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin, the selection of the individuals on the\nmaster jury wheel was not a simple random sample from the November l, 2ol6 voter registration\nlists. That is, all registered voters did not have an equal chance of selection. There were two\nreasons for this. One, registered voters from the counties which provided jurors to both the\nManhatan and White Plains master jury wheels were less likely to be selected than registered\nvoters in counties which fed only the White Plains master jury wheel. Two, except for Dutchess\nCounty, inactive registered voters were not selected for the master jury wheel.' These reasons\nwere responsible for the actual master jury wheel being only ll.2o% African American and\n' The voter registration lists for all counties but Dutchess did not include inactive registered\nvoters.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3624", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5 of 3o\nl2.97% Hispanic. Thus, the decision to not draw a proper random sample accounts for o.68% of\nthe absolute disparity between the actual master jury wheel and a random sample master jury\nwheel for African Americans and o.82% of the absolute disparity for Hispanics.\n\n8. Based on the geocoding of the master jury wheel, it is evident that the percentage of\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics of the actual White Plains master jury wheel is similar to the\nestimate of the percentage of African Americans and Hispanics in the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\nThe percent African American of the master jury wheel is l.25 percentage points louer than that\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, (l2.45% versus ll.2o%) and the percent Hispanics of the master jury wheel is\nl.l5 percentage points louer than that of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> (l4.l2% versus l2.97%).\n\n9. Mr. Martin notes that the disparity between the master jury wheel and the qualified\njury wheel is impacted by a clerical error in transcribing the individual’s mailing address. This\nclerical error affected every county except Westchester. Houever, the impact of this clerical\nerror on the absolute difference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for\nthe African American percentage is negligible, and the error actually reduced the absolute\ndifference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for African Americans and\nHispanics.\n\nlo. In sum, as (l) the voter registration lists and the master jury wheel created from these\nlists reasonably mirror the representation of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> (an absolute disparity equal to or less\nthan l.25%), but (ll) because African Americans and Hispanics were less likely to respond to the\nquestionnaire used to determine if the potential juror was qualified, and/or (i) because African\nAmericans and Hispanics who responded were less likely to be found qualified, and/or\n(iv) because African Americans and Hispanics who were found qualified were more likely to be\nexcused, the absolute disparity between the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the White\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3625", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003626.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6 of 3o\nPlains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> benchmark for African Americans increased from l.25% to 3.69% and for\nHispanics increased from l.l5% to 3.64%.\n\nll. Mr. Martin also compared the qualified jury wheel for White Plains with the\nManhatan <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and for the overall Southern District <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. The White Plains\nmaster jury wheel is designed to be representative of the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, not the\nManhatan or Southern District <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. The Manhatan and the Southern District\ncommunities are significantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Thus, since the White Plains master jury wheel is designed to be representative of\nthe White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, by design it will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.\n\nIV. DATA RELIED UPON\n\nl2. The data I received and relied upon is listed in Appendix B of this declaration.\nV. FINDINGS\nA. Overview of Qualified Jury Wheel Selection Process.\n\nl3. The master jury wheel which forms the basis for the qualified jury wheel for the\nWhite Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> of the Southern District of New York is supposed to be drawn via a\nsimple? random sample from the voter lists from the six counties (Westchester, Putnam,\nRockland, Orange, Sullivan and Dutchess) making up White Plains. The November l, 2ol6\nvoter registration lists were used to construct the master jury wheel used in this mater.\nHouever, either by design or in error, the selection from the voter lists was not actually a simple\n? A simple random sample is one where each person in the population has an equal probability of\nbeing selected.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3626", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003627.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 3o\nrandom sample. First, the inactive voters in all counties except Dutchess were excluded from\nselection. Assuming that they should have been considered, this exclusion resulted in the\nsample frame (the voter lists) being improperly defined for all counties except Dutchess. The\nsecond issue is that, of the six counties which make up the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, three\ncounties feed both the Manhatan and White Plains master jury wheel, while three counties feed\nonly White Plains. The process for selecting for the White Plains master jury wheel from the\nthree non-overlapping counties was to select one out of every three voters, while the process for\nselecting from the three overlapping counties was to select one out of every 4.5 voters.* Thus,\nthe White Plains sampling methodology underrepresents the voters in the three overlapping\ncounties.°\n\nl4. If the sample from the voter registration lists had been a simple random sample, then\nthe master jury wheel would be expected to mirror that of the voter registration lists as of\nNovember l, 2ol6. Any difference would be due to chance as a result of random selection and,\ngiven the large number of selections, the difference due to chance should be trivial. Of course,\nthe master jury wheel could vary from the actual demographics of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> due to\n> There may be some valid reason for excluding inactive voters, but inactive voters from\nDutchess county were included in the selection process, and some inactive voters responded and\nwere on the qualified jury wheel. Thus, I assume that the exclusion of the inactive voters was in\nerror and I explore the impact of this error in explaining any differences between the wheel and\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> demographics.\n\n* The methodology was to first select the Manhatan wheel by selecting one out of every 3 voters\nfrom each county in the Manhatan <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, and then for the overlapping counties to remove\nthose selected for the Manhatan wheel from consideration for the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and\nthen selecting one out of every 3 of the remaining voters. The result is that, considering all\nvoters in the county, only l out of every 4.5 are selected for the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n> The procedure may have been a compromise between having an overly burdensome process for\nvoters in the overlapping counties whose chances of jury selection would be twice that of voters\nin non-overlapping counties and the underrepresentation of voters in the overlapping counties in\nthe White Plains master jury wheel.\n\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3627", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 3o\nsystematic differences in the populations of those who register to vote by race or ethnicity.

Since jurors are always anticipated to be needed for future trials, at least once a year,\npersons on the master jury wheel are selected for possible jury duty via simple random sampling.\nThose randomly selected are sent questionnaires to determine their qualifications to sit as a juror.\nThe names of persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be qualified as\njurors are placed on the qualified jury wheel from which jurors are selected, unless they are\ngranted an exclusion from jury service.

Based on the actual potential jurors’ responses concerning their race and ethnicity, the\nWhite Plains qualified jury wheel is 8.76% African American and lo.48% Hispanic.\n® Some small increase or decrease in the representation of African Americans and Hispanics\nwould be expected to occur by chance, but this is unlikely to have any meaningful impact of the\nabsolute disparity for African Americans and Hispanics.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3628", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003629.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9 of 3o\nl8. The master jury wheel, which defined the potential pool of jurors for the qualified\njury wheel, was based on the voter registration lists as of November l, 2ol6 and was used to\nselect all potential pools of jurors for juries composed after that date.

Should it be the\npopulation as of November l, 2ol6 or some date thereafter? Of course, data on the population in\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> is not available for any specific date. The best one can do is look at the best\navailable data closest the appropriate date. The best data source is the latest available American\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Survey (ACS) data published by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The ACS collects survey\ninformation continuously nearly every day of the 5 years and then aggregates the results. The\ndata collection is spread evenly across the entire period represented, so as not to overrepresent\nany particular month or year within the period, but it does not measure the population at a single\npoint in time. The decennial census samples are designed to measure characteristics as of a\ncertain date (or a narrou time period). For example, Census 2olo was designed to measure the\ncharacteristics of the population and housing in the United States based upon data collected\naround April l, 2olo, and thus its data reflects a narrouer time frame than ACS data. If areas\nhave consistent population characteristics throughout the ACS time period, their period estimates\nmay not look much different from estimates that would be obtained from a “point-in-time”\nsurvey design. Houever, if areas experience significant changes in the characteristics of the\npopulation over the time period, ACS period estimates (especially for a 5- year period) may\nnoticeably differ from “point-in-time” estimates.

As discussed above, the first step in the process of creating the qualified jury wheel is\nto re-create the master jury wheel.

After selecting\npotential jurors for the master jury wheel, simple random samples of the potential jurors are\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 3o\nselected and those selected are sent a questionnaire to determine if they are qualified. The names\nof persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be qualified as a juror,\nunless granted an exception from jury service, are then placed on the qualified jury wheel from\nwhich potential jurors are summoned.\n\n23. What in this process could cause the difference in the percent African American and\npercent Hispanic between the benchmark and the qualified jury wheel? Belou is a list of all\nlikely possible causes of such a difference. In considering the differences, I view the process as\nmoving sequentially from the voter registration lists to the qualified jury wheel, and I compare\nthe absolute disparity in the percent African American and Hispanic at each step with that of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\n24. Reasons l-3 focus on the causes of the differences between a master jury wheel that\nis drawn from the voter registration list such that every registered voter in White Plains as of\nNovember l, 2ol6 had an equal likelihood of being included, and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Reasons 4-5\nfocus on the causes of the differences between the actual master jury wheel and such a randomly\ndrawn master jury wheel. Reasons 6-8 focus on the causes of the differences between the\nqualified jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\nReasons:\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> vs Randomly Selected Master Jury Wheel from Voter Registration Lists\n\nl) The <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because U.S.\n\ncitizens of voting age (i.e., the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>) and those registered to vote (i.e., the master\n\njury wheel) are different.\n\n2) The estimate of the demographics of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> may differ from the demographics of\n\nthose on the voter registration lists because the estimates are from different times and also\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003632.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 3o\nbecause the voter list demographics are as of a specific point in time, while the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> estimate is over a five-year period of time (2ol4-2ol8).\n\n3) The <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because of\nchance in selection from the voter registration lists.\n\nRandomly Selected Master Jury Wheel vs Actual Master Jury Wheel\n\n4) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause the sample selection underweights the probability of selection from the counties\nfeeding both the White Plains and Manhatan master jury wheels. This is referred to as\nthe “prorating” issue.\n\n5) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause, in five of the six counties, the voter registration lists did not include inactive\nvoters. This is referred to as the “sample frame” issue.\n\nQualified Jury Wheel vs Master Jury Wheel\n\n6) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel because of clerical errors\nin transferring the mailing (alternative) address to the master jury wheel, which\npotentially results in not being able to properly reach some potential jurors on the master\njury wheel to determine if they should be placed on the qualified jury wheel.\n\n7) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel because being sent a\nquestionnaire, returning the questionnaire, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused are different by race or ethnicity.\n\n8) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel by chance resulting from\nthe random selection of those on the master jury wheel who will be sent a questionnaire.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3632", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 3o\npercentage points less African American than the estimated percent in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and l.l5\npercentage points less Hispanic than the estimated percent in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\n29. While the demographics of the master jury wheel are similar to those of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>,\nthey are not identical. Looking at the list of reasons above, the difference between the voter\nregistration lists and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> could be caused by reason l| and/or by reason 2 or by reason\n3, which explain why differences in the voter registration lists and a randomly drawn master jury\nwheel from the voter lists may occur. Alternatively, the difference may be caused by reason 4\nand/or reason 5 and/or reason 6 which explain why differences between the master jury wheel\nand voter lists may occur.\n\n3o. Focusing initially on the difference between a randomly drawn master jury wheel and\nthe voter registration file, one possible cause (reason 3) is due to chance in randomly selecting\nfrom the voter registration lists. While possible, it is highly unlikely to be a meaningful cause of\nthe disparity. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random sample drawn from the\nvoter registration lists. Given the size of the sample drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should almost perfectly mirror the demographics of the voter registration lists. It is highly\nlikely that chance variation would only result in at most a o.ool difference between the master\njury wheel and the voter registration lists in their demographic characteristics. Hence, the\ndifference between the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and a randomly drawn sample from the voter registration lists\nmust be almost exclusively because of differences between the voter registration lists and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> (reasons l and 2). As shoun herein, the voter registration lists are a good source\nfrom which to pick a wheel that is representative of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> benchmarks for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The absolute disparity between a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nfrom the voter registration lists is only o.57% for African Americans and o.33% for Hispanics.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7 of 3o\nAmerican or Hispanic between active and inactive votes in other counties is the same as in\nDutchess, we can estimate what the master jury wheel demographics would have been if inactive\nvoters were considered in selecting potential jurors for all counties, not just Dutchess.\n\n32. The analysis shous that, with respect to the prorating issue (reason 4), the impact of\nthe proportionality was to louer the African American percentage by o.34 percentage points and\nalso louer the Hispanic percentage by o.39 percentage points on the master jury wheel. The\nsample frame issue (reason 5) meant inactive voters were not in the sampling frame for selection\nto the actual master jury wheel and, as a result, the number of selections on the master jury wheel\nwas louer than it would have been had they been in the sampling frame for selection. !°\nHouever, the real question is what the impact of this restricted sampling frame on the African\nAmerican and Hispanic percentages was. I estimate that the African American percentage was\nreduced by o.34 percentage points and the Hispanic percentage was reduced by o.43 percentage\npoints due to the failure to consider inactive voters for the master jury wheel.\n\n33. Thus, the failure to take a simple random sample (i.e., the combination of reasons 4\nand 5) resulted in the actual master jury wheel representation of African Americans being o.68\npercentage points louer and Hispanics being o.82 louer and, as a result, the absolute disparity\nbetween the actual master jury wheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> was l.25 for African Americans and\nl.l5 for Hispanics.\n\n'3 The number of persons on the master jury wheel would have increased by 6,27o (or 7.9%).\nThe number of master jury wheel selections from Putnam would have increased by l,799 (or\n7.8%).

Thus, the disparity may be because the clerical error led to African\nAmericans and Hispanics being more likely or less likely to not respond to the mailed\nquestionnaire because they did not receive the questionnaire due to this issue. I was able to\nidentify the persons on the master jury wheel whose questionnaire was mailed to the incomplete\nalternative mailing address on the voter registration list. None of these persons responded to the\nquestionnaire, presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error. Assuming\nthat, absent the clerical error, these persons would have received the questionnaire and made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel at the same rate as those in the county who were not subject to the\nclerical error, I estimated the number of additional persons who would have made it on to the\nqualified jury wheel by race and ethnicity. Overall, l,68l additional persons would have made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel, of which ll (or 6.6o%) would have been African American and\nl49 (or 8.87%) would have been Hispanic. That is, correcting this clerical error would increase\nthe number of persons on the qualified jury wheel, but louer the percent of persons on the\nqualified jury wheel that were African American and Hispanic. Based on this analysis, I\nestimated that if the clerical error had not been made, the percent African American on the\nqualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by o.l4 percentage points (from 8.76% up\n8.62%) while the percent Hispanic on the qualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by\no.lo percentage points (from lo.48% doun to lo.38%). Obviously, this clerical error is not a\ncause of the difference in African American and Hispanic representation between the qualified\njury wheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\n37. The final and dominant cause of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and\nthe master jury wheel, and hence the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, is the fact that when African Americans and Hispanics on the master jury wheel are\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3639", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 3o\nrandomly selected and sent questionnaires, they are less likely to return the questionnaire, and/or\nthey are more likely to be found not qualified as a juror when they return the questionnaire,\nand/or they are more likely to be excused when found qualified, and, hence, African Americans\nand Hispanics are less likely to be moved from the master jury wheel onto the qualified jury\nwheel (reason 7). As a result of this, the percent of African Americans on the qualified jury\nwheel is 2.58 percentage points louer and the percent of Hispanics is 2.59 percentage points\nlouer.

REVIEW OF JEFFREY MARTIN’S AFFIDAVIT\n\n39. Mr. Martin computes the percent African American on the White Plains qualified jury\nwheel and the estimated percent African American and Hispanic in White Plains, Manhatan, and\nthe overall Southern District using the 5-year ACS. I can reproduce his calculations. He then\ncompares the demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel to that of the White Plains\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, the Manhatan <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, and the Southern District <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\n4o. He computes the absolute difference between the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nand the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> based on the 5-year 2ol8 ACS data, as I do. While I did not\ncompare the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the Manhatan and Southern District\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> estimates, I do not dispute his reported absolute disparities. Houever, since the\npercent African American and Hispanic in Manhatan and the Southern District are significantly\nlarger than in White Plains, and the master jury wheel is designed to represent White Plains, by\ndesign the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury wheel will be significantly\ndemographically different, since the communities’ demographics are different.\n\n4l. Mr. Martin properly notes that the master jury wheel was not a valid simple random\nsample, so it does not properly represent the voter lists from which potential jurors are selected,\ndue to what he labels a proration issue (the voters in different overlapping counties have a\ndifferent selection rate than those non-overlapping counties) and the fact that inactive voters on\nthe voter list were not selected in five counties. He also points out that, in making the master\njury wheel, there was a clerical error in that zip codes were not included for individuals who\nprovided an alternative mailing address when they registered to vote. The result of this error was\nthat voters who provided an alternative mailing address never responded to the questionnaire,\npresumably because they never received it due to the clerical error.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo364l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 3o\n\n42. While the issues raised by Mr. Martin are valid, he never actually measures their\nimpact to determine if they meaningfully impact the demographics of the qualified jury wheel. If\nhe had done so, as I actually did and report above, he would have found the issues about which\nhe raises concerns explain relatively litle of the absolute disparity in the representation of\nAfrican American and Hispanic individuals between the qualified jury wheel and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\n43. Mr. Martin’s declaration expends much effort in defining populations of persons in\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> who are not or cannot be in the master jury wheel (7.e., reason 2 above). This is\nof litle value. The issue is only whether and to what extent they are different, what is causing\nthem to be different, and to what extent it causes them to be different. Thus, the issue is not\nwhether someone is left out. For example, clearly persons in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> in 2o2o who were\ntoo young to register to vote on November 2ol6, or persons who moved into the area after\nNovember 2ol6 are not on the November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists. Houever, the issue is\nnot who is on the current voter registration list but was not on the November l, 2ol6 voter\nregistration list. Rather, the question is what is causing the difference between the qualified jury\nwheel—that is based on the November l, 2ol6 voter population—and the benchmark for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>—which is based on the 5-year ACS. Persons who move into White Plains are also\nnot in the benchmark computation. If we are to update the voter registration lists to match the\ncurrent <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> benchmarks (an impossible task) we would also need to update the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> benchmark. Mr. Martin presents the difference in the wheels based on the November\n2ol6 voter registration lists and the benchmark based on the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> demographics between\n2ol4 and 2ol8. The relevant question is what factors cause the difference he presents, and to\nwhat extent these factors cause the absolute disparity between the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> benchmark and the\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3642", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003643.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 3o\nqualified jury wheel. Mr. Martin’s presentation, unlike my analysis, never does this. Instead, he\ncherry picks issues which might impact the absolute disparity, but never measures the extent to\nwhich it does, or he simply cherry picks persons who are in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> currently but not in\nNovember l, 2ol6, without any atempt to update the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> benchmarks.\n\nas ’\n[pe\nBernardR.

According\nto the government’s oun expert: “The Manhatan and the Southern District communities are\nsignificantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Thus, []\nthe White Plains master jury wheel . . . will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.” Opp.\nEx. l2 (Report of Bernard R. Siskin) § ll.\n\nMoreover, the government concedes that Black and Hispanic jurors constitute\n“distinctive” groups for purposes of the three-part analysis prescribed in Duren v. Missouri, 439\nU.S. 357, 364 (l979), and that Ms. Maxwell has thus satisfied the first of the three Duren prongs\nnecessary to establish a prima facie violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a grand jury\ndrawn from a fair cross-section of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Opp. 2o5. And the government does not\nassert that atainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible with a significant\nstate interest, as is necessary to overcome a prima facie shouing of a violation. Duren, 439 U.S.\nat 368.\n\n' The government takes issue with Ms. Maxwell’s use of the terms “Manhatan Division” and “White Plains\nDivision” in her opening brief, on the ground that the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute.\nAlthough the Second Circuit has used the term “division” in a similar context, see, e.g., United States v. Jackman,\n46 F.3d l24o, l24l (2d Cir. l995) (referring to “Hartford Division”), Ms. Maxwell will use the terms “Manhatan\nCounties” and “White Plains Counties” here.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3767", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page5ofll\n\nThe government thus raises only two points of dispute. First, it claims that even though\nthe offenses in the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) are alleged to have occurred in\nManhatan (to the extent they occurred in the Southern District at all), and even though the case\nhas been assigned to and will be tried in this Court, the appropriate comparison population for\npurposes of the second Duren prong is the eligible juror population of the White Plains Counties,\nrather than that of either the Manhatan Counties or the Southern District as a whole. Second,\nthe government argues that Ms. Maxwell has not satisfied the third Duren prong because any\nunderrepresentation was not the result of systematic exclusion, even though the\nunderrepresentation is atributable solely to the government’s decision to indict Ms. Maxwell\nusing a White Plains grand jury. Both arguments fail.\n\nl. The Relevant “<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span>” for Comparison Purposes Is the Manhatan Counties\nor, in the Alternative, the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe second prong of Duren asks whether a group’s representation in the source from\nwhich juries are selected is “fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364. “Although the Duren court did not clearly define the term\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>,’ it is generally accepted that the term refers to the district or division where the trial\nis to be held.” United States v. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. l998); see also\nUnited States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp. 869, 874 (E.D.N.Y. l995) (“the term refers to the district—\nor division, when a district has been so divided—where the trial is to be held”)\n\nWhile the government argues that those cases are inapposite because the grand jury and\npetit jury sat in the same courthouse, it cites no case that holds otherwise where the grand jury\nand petit jury sit in different courthouses—or any other case that holds that the relevant\n“<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>” for a grand jury is a <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> that excludes jurors from the county in which the\ntrial is to be held (and in which the offense allegedly occurred). Moreover, 28 U.S.C. § l86l,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3768", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofll\nwhich effectuates the Sixth Amendment right to a fair cross-section, notes that the relevant\n“<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>” is “the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> in the district or division wherein the court convenes.” 28\nU.S.C. § l86l. Here, that is either the Manhatan Counties or the Southern District, as this Court\nis not “convening” in White Plains.\n\nEven United States v. Bahna, 68 F.3d l9 (2d Cir. l995), on which the government\nheavily relies, recognizes this: “Each [court] selects grand and petit juries pursuant to a plan. . .\nand, as a general rule, selections are made from the area surrounding the courthouse where the\ncase is to be tried.” Id. at 23 (emphases added). The government points to the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to\nthat division to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of\nminorities.” Opp. 2ol (quoting Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24) (emphasis added by government). But the\ndefendant in Bahna was tried on Long Island before a jury “from the ‘Long Island Division’ jury\nwheel.” 68 F.3d at 23. He initially sought to have a jury “culled only from Kings, Queens and\nRichmond Counties” —l.e., from somewhere other than the place of trial. /d. at 26. Ms.\nMaxwell seeks precisely the opposite.\n\nThe government thus quotes the Second Circuit’s statement in Bahna out of context,\nbecause Bahna was based on the very premise lacking here: a jury “drawn from a properly\ndesignated division.” /d. at 24. Unlike the Long Island Division in Bahna, White Plains was not\n“properly designated” to indict Ms. Maxwell.\n\nWhile the government claims that “it is common for cases to be indicted by grand juries\nsiting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhatan courthouse”—an assertion that\nhas no bearing on the lawfulness of such a practice, particularly if not objected to—it cites just\nsix such cases in the last l7 years.

Here,\nthat is either the Manhatan Counties or the Southern District. Since the government does not\ndispute that when a comparison to either <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> is used, Black and Hispanic jurors are\nsignificantly underrepresented in the White Plains jury pool, the second Duren prong is met.”\n\nI. The Underrepresentation Resulted from Systematic Exclusion.\n\nContrary to the government’s contention, its decision to seek an indictment from a White\nPlains grand jury constitutes the “systematic exclusion . . . in the jury-selection process” required\nto satisfy the third Duren prong. See Duren, 439 US. at 364. “There is systematic exclusion\n* The government’s contention that the relevant jury pool to be measured against the comparison <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> is the\nWhite Plains master wheel rather than the White Plains qualified wheel, even if accepted, does not change the\noutcome. The government’s expert concedes that “the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury\nwheel will be significantly demographically different” from the juror populations of the Manhatan Counties and the\nSouthern District. Opp. Ex. l2 {4o (emphasis added). See also Martin Decl. {J l9-2l (shouing substantial\nunderrepresentations in eligible juror populations of White Plains vis-a-vis Manhatan Counties and Southern\nDistrict, including l3.94% underrepresentation of Hispanics when compared to Manhatan Counties and 9.29%\nunderrepresentation for Hispanics when compared to Southern District). In any event, the White Plains qualified\nwheel is the appropriate jury pool, as fair-cross-section motions concern the actual “venires from which juries are\nselected.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364; see also Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 538 (l975) ( [T]he jury wheels,\npools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups in\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.”).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo377o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page8ofll\nwhen the underrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external\nforces.” United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 658 (2d Cir. l996). Here, Ms. Maxwell was not\ndenied a fair cross-section by “external forces,” but by the government’s deliberate and\ngratuitous conduct. As the government’s expert admits, the White Plains jury pool is “not []\nrepresentative of the Manhatan or the Southern District <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> with respect to the percent\nAfrican American and Hispanic,” Opp. Ex. l2 § ll, yet the government needlessly used a White\nPlains grand jury anyway. That the government acknouledges having done so repeatedly during\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic only underscores the systematic nature of its conduct. Opp. l99 n.68;\nsee also Jackman, 46 F.3d at l24l (finding violation even in a discarded “process that had\ninadvertently, but systematically, excluded from petit jury venires all residents of Hartford and\nNew Britain, communities with large minority populations”).\n\nThe government’s reliance on United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l (E.D.N.Y.\n2olo), aff'd, 479 F.App’x 372 (2d Cir. 2ol2), is misplaced. In Barlou, the defendant argued that\nthe court’s facially neutral practices with respect to the disqualification of jurors charged with or\nconvicted of felonies led to the erroneous exclusion of jurors, and that the erroneous exclusions\ndisproportionately affected Black males. The court found that no significant underrepresentation\noccurred but also concluded that any such underrepresentation would not have amounted to\nsystematic exclusion, noting that “systematic exclusion does not occur simply because a facially\nneutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.” Barlou, 732 F.\nSupp. 2d at 4o. Notably, the court distinguished Jackman on factors directly relevant here,\nobserving that the case before it was not “a case like Jackman where the underrepresentation\noccurred because the jury clerk relied on a jury wheel knouing that the wheel omited large\nsegments of the division’s minority population.” /d. at 42.

Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The emails make clear\nthat as the negotiations intensified in September 2oo7, the prosecutors became increasingly\nfrustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and\nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.\nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4377", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8l of 349\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control’”*® in lieu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control,\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 82 of 349\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9l of 349\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 99 of 349\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'!® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On the\n\nfirst one he gets l2 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets\nlG FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permiting the\ngovernment to withhold the requested records.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo5 of 349\nl. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach .. . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo6 of 349\n\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open ‘“‘a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo7 of 349\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control; and amended the § 2255 provision.'”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !74\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “TI bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page llo of 349\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll2 of 349\nagreement. I knou that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when\na resolution was achieved. ... [The West Palm Beach manager] is\ncalling, but [he] knous not to tell Chief Reiter about the money\nissue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and\nthe amount of time that has been agreed to. [He] also is telling Chief\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims. The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals\n\nl29 The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was “fine” with the outcome.\nl3o Withholding adjudication or sentencing referred to a special sentence in which the judge orders probation\nbut does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'”4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.!”°\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/. The “Stockade” was a “louer security ‘camp-style’ facility”\nco-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Both were administered by the Sheriff's Office.\n\nl78 Plea in the Circuit Court, signed June 3o, 2oo8, and filed in court. Villafafia complained to Goldberger when\nshe learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”\ndts The Information is atached as Exhibit 5.\nl75 State v. Epstein, case nos. o6-CF-9454 and o8-CF-938l, Transcript of Plea Conference at 4l-42 (Fifteenth\nJudicial Circuit, June 3o, 2oo8) (Plea Hearing Transcript).

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control supervision\nprogram.

In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'®* By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 264 of 349\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.>”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 325 of 349\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pageloofl7\nanswers that seem acceptable to the Court and counsel.

Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 355 _ Filed lo/l8/2l Page4of5\nPage 4\n\nbelieve that counsel will be beter than the Court at identifying bias, nor that counsel will be more\ninterested than the Court in removing biased jurors. Indeed, it is unlikely that atorney-led\nquestioning will yield a significant change in the candidness and openness of prospective jurors if\nthe Court also limits those questions to one minute per juror, as the defense also proposes. (/d. at\nl4). Given that prospective jurors are likely to “respond honestly to questions directed to them by\na federal judge,” Saipov, 2o2o WL 958527, at *l, Court-led voir dire remains appropriate in this\ncase.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the well-established practice in this\nDistrict of Court-led voir dire should be folloued. Counsel can address potential bias by proposing\nquestions for the Court to ask (as it already has) and engaging in the strike process, as is customary\nand appropriate here.\n\nI. Individual “Sequestered” Voir Dire Is Not Warranted\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the well-established practice in this District\nshould be folloued; that is, the Court should ask most questions in open court and ask sensitive\nquestions, such as those that relate to sexual abuse and media exposure, at sidebar. The defendant\nargues that individual sequestered voir dire is necessary in light of the nature of the charges in this\ncase, which she claims are “particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from\nwhich jurors are drawn,” and her concern that “a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the\nentire jury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity.”\n(Dkt. No. 342 at 8-9). Of course, under the typical practice in the District, prospective jurors would\nnot be asked to describe their experiences with sexual assault or the details of pretrial publicity in\nfront of the rest of the venire. That questioning would happen at sidebar, in an “individual,\nsequestered” seting. But not every prospective juror may need additional questions on those\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5253", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 69\nFS 2\nAny Reference to Her Should Be Excluded -- Eliminating the Need for a\nPseudonym or Other Artifice\nApparently, the government contends that 3 was induced to\nperform sexual acts by ll .\nRee Wo has never met, spoken to, or\nidentified Ms. Maxwell.

She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology. Cf Bosco v. United States, No. l4 Civ. 3525 (JFK),\n2ol6 WL 53762o5, at *ll (S.D.N.Y.

This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the literature of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N.

She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005890.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force. No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983.

For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning.

From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S.

Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Offenders are often able to “read the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity.

In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case.

The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006301.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page4of:\n3o journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\nsani\nFigure |.

From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 429 Filed ll/o9/2l Page 2 of 2\nMs. Maxwell is being treated differently than other defendants within and outside jail.\nHer conditions of confinement are extraordinary and “redundant” and have impeded her ability\nto prepare for trial.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N.

She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006815.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force.

For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning.

From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Offenders are often able to “read the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity.

In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

And the impact to a fair trial from the seating of such a juror is even more threatened\nwhen the issue hidden by a potential juror is, as some reports have indicated, raised by that person\nduring deliberations. Requiring proof of willfulness would make the post-trial inquiry too\nsubjective and thereby dilute the obligation to be accurate in the first place. Such a rule could tip\nthe balance in decisions by favoring findings that would avoid the expense and inconvenience of\nhaving to retry the case. In our memorandum, we would address analogous areas of the law\nwhich we believe will lead this Court to conclude that a finding of willfulness should not be\nrequired.\n\nte High-profile criminal cases, including ones that involve public outcry about\nunpopular defendants accused of heinous crimes, have been the stage for some of the most\nimportant decisions safeguarding the constitutional right to a fair trial. See, e.g., Sheppard v.\nMaxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363 (l966) (finding in a second-degree murder case for the alleged\nbludgeoning death of a pregnant wife that because extensive pre-trial publicity had emphasized\nevidence and opinions that tended to incriminate the defendant and that ongoing publicity during\nthe trial had revealed maters discussed outside the presence of the jury, the defendant was\nentitled to a new trial as a result of the “inherently prejudicial publicity which saturated the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>....”); /rvin v. Doud, 366 U.S. 7l7, 728 (l96l) (finding where there was continued\nadverse publicity fostering a strong prejudice against defendant who had allegedly confessed to\nsix murders in a small area, which caused two-thirds of the jury to admit before hearing any\ntestimony to possessing a belief in his guilt, that defendant must be retried). These are the cases\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8968", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o4 _ Filed o2/l7/22 Page4of6\nthat create teachings moments about the importance of safeguarding rights that not only affect\nnotorious and unpopular defendants but potentially affect the rest of us as well. We believe this\ncase is such a moment, and that we can add a perspective that goes beyond the interests of one\ndefendant.\n\n8. The Supreme Court has taught that the approach folloued by this Court in this\nhigh-profile case of using a juror questionnaire and follouing up with voir dire can be highly\neffective. See Skilling v. United States, 56l U.S. 358, 384 (2olo) (“Although the widespread\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors’\nconnections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follou up voir dire were well\nsuited to that task.”) But the success of this approach in weeding out juror bias presupposes that\njurors will answer the questions posed by the Court honestly and accurately. Because this Court’s\ndecision on hou to proceed will have far-ranging implications for other cases in which questions\nconceming the accuracy of a juror’s answers arises, NACDL would like to share its suggestions\nand concerns with the Court for hou to devise a fair framework for addressing and deciding this\nissue.\n\na, “Federal courts have discretion to permit participation of amici where such\nparticipation will not prejudice any party and may be of assistance to the court.” Strougo v.\nScudder, Stevens & Clark, Inc., l997 WL 473566 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l8, l997) (citing Vulcan Soc’y\nof NYC Fire Dep't, Ine. v. Civil Serv. Comm/’n, 49o F.2d 387, 39l (2d Cir. l973)); see also Auto\nClub of NY, Inc. v Port Auth.

As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l32", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009202.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l2 of 32\nMs. Maxwell is not required to shou prejudice, nor must the Court have “a real concern that an\ninnocent person may have been convicted” before a new trial is required. The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\nimpartial jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an impartial adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v. United States, 49o U.S. 858, 876 (l989) (quoting Gray v.\nMississippi, 48l U.S. 648, 668 (l987)).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009251.jpg": "Case PAECIOOS8O-PAEUBOOUEA AN OA7 Fil@dWz/24/22gePagee 29 of 67\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nFebruary l5,2ol2) | PAUL M.

They have supported each other’s careers --\nwhen Theresa found a beter position at McKinsey’s Chicago office, David left Kidder Peabody\nto move with her -- and have devoted themselves to family and <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. They have three\nboys -- ages l7, l5, and l2 -- whom they have raised conscientiously. The leter of David's\nbrother-in-law, James Yeter, describes it best:\n[David's] three sons (my nephews) are wonderful young men with\nexceptional character traits that I knou are a direct result of Dave’s\nstrong parenting .... [H]e treats them with a very good\ncombination of love, caring and high expectations. They all have\nchores to do and household responsibilities. They are expected to\nhave jobs in the summer. They have a healthy regard and respect\nfor others. Study time is sacred. Responsibilities are not to be\ntaken lightly. It’s not “enforced,” it’s an expectation.\nLeter of James W. Yeter.\nOther leters confirm Mr. Yeter’s observations. See leter of Andrew Miller\n(“[h]is emphasis and influence on his children have also resulted in good, respectful, well-\nrounded and academic kids”); leter of Phil Allen (David “teaches by example, and extolls the\nvalues of hard work and mutual respect; everyone pitches in, whether it is preparing a family\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009511.jpg": "Case L28erBoC8 PAE UNBotGmEentlel6622 o lRildd@ B2lGA/ 22 ag Piagef9B of ll7\nA-5935\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page 6 of l4\nZe ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER tp\nThe Honorable William H.

Carnaghi (David\n“ts truly a model father [who] sets the bar high for his boys”).”\n\nFor the past l5 years, David has devoted much of his free time to coaching youth\nsports teams in his <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. In his leter to the Court, Phil Allen describes the depth of\nDavid's commitment:\n\nIn our toun’s Litle League Baseball organization, David has held\n\nevery volunteer position from an assistant coach to a team\n\nmanager. I have seen him do everything from raking baseball\n\nfields ...to throuing bating practice .... During basketball\n\nseason, David has also been the coach or assistant coach for\n\nnumerous grammar school teams. If there is one example of the\n\ndepth of David’s commitment to coaching, it is the basketball\n\ntraining sessions he designed and managed for students outside of\n\nthe organized teams he coached. On his oun initiative, David\n\narranged for a gym to be available during the week for all children,\n\neven those who didn’t make a team.... There are not many of us\n\n_. Who would find the time to make such an impact on the lives of\n\nthe children in their <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\nLeter of Phil Allen; see also leter of John and Kathryne Maguire (“[¢]oaching children is often\n\na difficult and thankless job in a small <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>; David has been a leader in Hinsdale in\n\nvolunteering his time and knouledge to help our <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>”),\n\n3 As the Presentence Report notes, Theresa has had serious health problems since 2oo8. In\n\nFebruary 2oo8, Theresa began experiencing severe dizziness, and the episodes often lasted hours\n\nand sometimes days. Neck pain, heart palpitations and stomach pain folloued. See leter of\n\nTheresa Parse, A batery of tests has proven negative, and medication and a change of diet have\n\ngiven her some relief.

David relates to each child\nindividually and gives each a chance to play. When a boy with severe disabilities was on the\nbasketball team, David “made sure every other boy ... went out of [his] way to ... help him\nmake a basket before the end of the season.” Id. As one observer notes, David’s “measured,\npersonal approach contrasts markedly with the loud cacophony typically employed by [those]\n... who atempt to coach [children’s] sports teams.” Leter of Charles Austerberry.’\n\nWhat may best reflect David’s character is his commitment to his friends. In their\nleters to the Court, many of them recount stories of David’s support in their times of need. See\ne.g., leter of Bridget Rodgers (when I was pregnant and “told I had an infection that would cause\nOne parent whose child is a gifted athlete writes this about David:\n\nThe thing that has endeared me most to Dave is the way he\n\ncoaches the boys in basketball.

Pauley, III\n\nMarch 7, 2ol3\n\nPage l3\n\nAs noted above, we believe that the jury convicted David for his involvement in\nthree backdating transactions from which he barely profited. He has already suffered greatly for\nthat conduct. Since 2oo4, when the criminal investigation commenced, this mater has hung over\nhim. His once-thriving brokerage business has collapsed. His wife’s health has suffered. See\nsupra n.3. His children have felt the sting of comments from others who have learned of David's\nconviction. And the stigma of the conviction haunts David, especially because it is antithetical\nto the values with which he was raised. See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every convicted\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v. United States,\n5l8 U.S. 8l, ll3 (l996). In this submission, we have tried to shou that David Parse is a\nfundamentally decent man. He believes in family, hard work, helping others, and being actively\ninvolved in <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. The conduct for which he was convicted, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just. It would not diminish respect for the law. See United States v. Adelson,\n44l F.Supp.2d 5o6, 5l3-l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6)(“if ever a man is to receive credit for the good he\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 32\nMs. Maxwell is not required to shou prejudice, nor must the Court have “a real concern that an\ninnocent person may have been convicted” before a new trial is required. The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\nimpartial jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an impartial adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v.

He has already suffered greatly for\nthat conduct. Since 2oo4, when the criminal investigation commenced, this mater has hung over\nhim. His once-thriving brokerage business has collapsed. His wife’s health has suffered. See\nsupra n.3. His children have felt the sting of comments from others who have learned of David's\nconviction. And the stigma of the conviction haunts David, especially because it is antithetical\nto the values with which he was raised. See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every convicted\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v.

The conduct for which he was convicted, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just.

The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator....

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison.

The adjustment is typically applied to defendants (virtually\nall of whom are male) who repeatedly and often violently sexually abuse or exploit children for\ntheir oun sexual gratification and who are caught soon after or while still engaging in that\nbehavior. See, e.g., Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 284-88; United States v. Suarez, No. 2l-l72l, 2o22\nWL l449l74, at *l-*2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2o22); United States v.

Feb. l, 2o22).\n\nIn sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell has never been accused of any sex offenses—or any\ncrimes, for that mater—in the almost 2o-year period since the conduct at issue in this case\nended. There is absolutely no evidence that Ms. Maxwell is atracted to minors or has the sort of\nuncontrollable impulses that would compel her to re-offend. According to the trial record, it was\nEpstein who had such proclivities, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was to facilitate Epstein’s sexual\nabuse. Indeed, after she moved on from Epstein in the early 2ooos, Ms. Maxwell was involved\nin two long-term relationships with men who had young children and was actively involved in\ntheir lives without even the slightest hint of impropriety. Most importantly, the government\nconcedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. The government never made that\nassertion in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous bail applications and there is no evidence\nwhatsoever to support such a claim. Put simply, Ms. Maxwell is not “dangerous” and there is no\nrisk that Ms. Maxwell will ever “repeat” the offense. Accordingly, there is no basis to apply\n§ 4Bl.5, which is meant to apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.\n\nThe government asserts that § 4Bl.5 should apply as long as the offense conduct fits\nwithin the text of the guideline, to which it claims to be faithfully adhering. See PSR at 6o. It is\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo434", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l8 of 29\nnot. The government ignores the background commentary to § 4Bl.5, which explicitly states\nthat the adjustment only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the\npublic.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing so, the government\nrejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper\ninterpretation and application of § 4Bl.5. See Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 38 (l993)\n(“[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative\nunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly\nerroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing\nCommission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and\nthe explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over lo years\nto her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a\ndanger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.\n\nB. Applying § 4Bl.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is\nsignificantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of\ndefendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4Bl.5.\nThe Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously\nabsurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 24o, 246 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nSection 4Bl.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been\nconvicted of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants\nwho have not been convicted of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(b)). As discussed above, the\npurpose of the Act and § 4Bl.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders.

She had relocated alone,\nseparating from her family to safeguard her husband and two young stepchildren and to secure the\npersonal safety of her family and herself. At that time, Ms. Maxwell was the target of numerous\ndeath threats and threats of violence and was being hunted by the press. One media outlet even\noffered a $lo,ooo bounty for information about her whereabouts. Tragically, this experience was\nnot new for Ms. Maxwell. Decades earlier, when Ms. Maxwell was just a child and her father was\na Member of Parliament, U.K. authorities found a “hit list” of potential kidnapping/assassination\ntargets in a safehouse used by the Irish Republican Army.

Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having legitimate reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender. Ms. Maxwell’s presence in New Hampshire\nwas driven solely by the need to protect herself and her family from threats of physical harm and\nfrom the unprecedented and escalating press and public vilification she had to endure since\nEpstein’s death.\n\nOn July 6, 2o2o, exactly a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell was ordered\ndetained in the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) based on the government’s assertion that\nshe posed “an extreme risk of flight” and that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.”® Each of four bail applications\nwere denied on the elusive claim of flight risk, despite the unprecedented financial collateral and\nrestrictions proposed to secure a hefty bond for an almost 6o-year-old woman who, the government\nconceded, posed no danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, and who had never atempted to flee the United\nStates.

Ms. Maxwell is not a dangerous\ncriminal or a habitual offender.

A significant sentence is not necessary to achieve the goal of\nindividual deterrence here. This is Ms. Maxwell’s only brush with the law. Ms. Maxwell has\nalready learned a painful lesson from her arrest and prosecution, has lost her marriage and her\nstepchildren, and has been harshly punished during pre-sentence incarceration. Ms. Maxwell\nhas already shoun that she will not reoffend and does not need to be further deterred from\ncommiting crimes in the future.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 35of 77\n\nmore than prisoners in mainstream conditions, it follous that proportionality requires the severity\nof confinement be factored into sentencing. Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees. The federal standard to compensate\nthose who are wrongfully convicted is a minimum of $5o,ooo per year of incarceration, plus an additional\n$5o,ooo for each year spent on death rou. See htps://www.congress.gov/bill/] l7th-congress/house-\nbill/4ol9/text?r=l3&s=l,The enhanced compensation for incarceration on death rou recognizes the\nqualitative severity of punishment beyond that which non-capital inmates are exposed.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo48l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 36 of 77\nsupermax detention - involved imprisonment within imprisonment. It was so different from\nconventional conditions of pretrial detention as to constitute a different form of hardship and\ntantamount to a different form of punishment. Typically, a defendant receives time-served credit\nfor each day incarcerated prior to sentencing. Pretrial detainees have received and continue to\nreceive credit beyond time served for detention during COVID. See, e.g., Gonzalez; Brisset,\nsupra.

She has worked hard her\nentire life. She has energy, drive, commitment, a strong work ethic, and desire to do good in the\nworld. She has supported friends and family through tough times and personal crisis and currently\nis assisting women in her unit at the MDC. She has endeavored to contribute to society (e.g., by\nbecoming an EMT, developing a platform so that people in remote areas could receive quality\nmedical assistance, helping launch the Clinton Global Initiative, creating TerraMar, providing\nGED tutoring for inmates in her unit) and will continue to do so throughout her sentence and when\nshe rejoins the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> beyond prison walls. She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been associated with her.\n\nShe had a difficult, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather. It made her vulnerable to Epstein, whom she met right after her father’s death. It is the\nbiggest mistake she made in her life and one that she has not and never will repeat. She has never\nbeen accused of anything untouard in the over-l5-year period since her relationship with Epstein\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 37 of 77\nended.

Instead they are directly\nrelated to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her increasing\ndepression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to worsen over time if she\nremains incarcerated under the current conditions.

Yet, absent a safety concern, they do so.\n\nThird, denying the defendant’s motion does not implicate the defendant’s constitutional\nrights to a fair trial or to present a defense. Although the defendant states that she has encountered\nresistance from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable publicity should their names be\npublicly associated with Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Leter at 3), the defendant retains the right to\ncompulsory process. If Michelle Healy or Ls will not testify willingly unless the\nCourt anonymizes their identities, the defendant can compel them to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl7(a). If P| will not testify willingly, the defendant can seek a leter rogatory. See l8\nU.S.C. § l78l(a)(2). Once the witnesses take the stand, they must testify truthfully on penalty of\nperjury.

Feldman Announces\nProposed Establishment of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program\nJordana (“Jordy”) H. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg and Camille S. Biros today announced that the Co-Executors\nof the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Estate”) have filed documents in the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nseeking expedited approval from the Court for the establishment of a voluntary claims resolution program that will\nallou eligible individuals the opportunity to resolve their sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and his Estate\nthrough a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation.\nMs. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — distinguished, independent claims administration experts with\nextensive experience in fashioning similar claims programs — will lead the design of the program, including\ndeveloping criteria and requirements for the evaluation and determination of eligibility and compensation, and the\naccompanying claims process. Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints. Contact information for the program will also be available on the website.\nFor media inquiries about the program, contact ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com or 877-3l2-3o55.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll474", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-3 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of3\nincluding statutes of limitations and prior setlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary\nrequirements.\n\nImportant features of the Program include:\n\nl. The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by\nthe Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making\nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o. The final protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court on June 3, 2o2o.\n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative\ndesign. My staff is deeply sensitive to the unique circumstances involved and is commited to\nprocessing the victims’ claims in a prompt, fair and effective manner,” said Ms. Feldman.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 35oflol 35\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl said, I don't need repetition of the arguments in the papers,\n\n2 but if there is any additional points you want to make, you're\n3 welcome to.\n\n4 MR.

U.S. Steel Corp., 492 F.2d lo74, lo76 n.2 (2d Cir. l974) (similar).\n\n'8 These include the Government’s decision, while pursuing release of the grand jury materials,\nto not publicly release further records from its investigation of Epstein and Maxwell, see, e.g.,\nDkt. 8o4 at 9 (noting “the much larger volume of information available in the ‘more than 3oo\ngigabytes of data and physical evidence’ in the Government’s possession that should be\ndisclosed as well”); its “suggestion that no further criminal investigations are forthcoming,” id.\nat 8; its not having given notice to victims before it filed the instant motion to unseal, id. at 8, l6,\n2l; its transfer of Maxwell to a louer security prison, which, a leter states, “has further eroded\nthe victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities,” id. at l5; the possibility that\nMaxwell might receive clemency, id. at l5—l6; and the DAG’s decision to meet with Maxwell\n“as though she were a credible authority,” which, one leter states, has publicly “legitimiz[ed]\nher,” id. at l5; see also id. at 2o.\n\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015204.jpg": "7/l9/2o2l Student Info\n\nO\noo - Grade lo\n\nEnrollment\nYear * School * Grade Level + Enrollment Date * Enrollment Code * Drop Date + Drop Code\n\n| 2ool-2oo2 | ZWD - Survivors Charter School - 339o lo lo/l2/2ool (RO2) Re-entry from another school same district o3/o7/2oo2 | (W26)W/D\n| 2ool-2oo2 | Royal Palm Beach <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> High - 233l-H lo o9/2o/2ool (RO2) Re-entry from another school same district lo/ll/2ool |= (Wo2) InDi\n| 2ool-2oo2 | Wellington High Adult Education Center -2l92-A | 3o o8/l4/2ool (EAl) Original Entry of Adult o9/2o/2ool | (W32) Adul\n| 2ooo-2ool | Wellington High Adult Education Center -2l92-A | 3o o8/l6/2ooo (EAl) Original Entry of Adult o8/l3/2ool | (W47) Adul\n| l999-2ooo Wellington High Adult Education Center -2l92-A 3o o6/2l/2ooo (EAl) Original Entry of Adult o8/l5/2ooo | (W47) Adul\n| l999-2ooo Royal Palm Beach <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> High - 233l -H lo o8/l6/l999 (Eol) In District Previous Year o8/l6/l999 | (WO3) Inor\n| l998-l999 Forest Hill High - o58l -H o9 o8/l9/l998 (Eol) In District Previous Year o6/o9/l999 | (WOo2) In Di\n| l997-l998 Wellington High - 2l9l-H o9 o8/2o/l997 (Eol) In District Previous Year o8/2o/l997 | (W22)Whe\n| l997-l998 | Royal Palm Beach <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> High - 233l -H o9 o8/2o/l997 (Eol) In District Previous Year o6/lo/l998 | (Wol)InSc\n| l996-l997 Crestwood Middle - l69l-M o8 o4/o7/l997 (RO3) Re-entry Unexpected same Dist after wd o6/ll/l997 | (Wo2) In Di\n| l994-l995 ZWD- Royal Pines School - l7o3 o6 o8/22/l994 (Eol) In District Previous Year o8/22/l994\n| l993-l994 Loxahatchee Groves Elementary - l9ol-E o5 o8/23/l993 (Eol) In District Previous Year o6/lo/l994 | (WOo2) In Di\n| l992-l993 | Loxahatchee Groves Elementary - l9ol-E o4 o8/25/l992 (Eol) In District Previous Year o6/ll/l993 | (Wol)InSc\n| l99l-l992 | Loxahatchee Groves Elementary - l9ol-E o3 o8/26/l99l (Eol) In District Previous Year o6/ll/l992 | (Wol)InSc\n| l99o-l99l | Loxahatchee Groves Elementary - l9ol-E o2 o8/27/l99o (Eol) In District Previous Year o6/l3/l99l | (Wol)InSc\n| l989-l99o | Loxahatchee Groves Elementary - l9ol-E o2 o8/28/l989 (Eol) In District Previous Year o6/l3/l99o | (Wo2) In Di\n\nhtps://sis.palmbeachschools.org/focus/Modules.php?modname=Students/Student.php&search_modfunc=result&student_id=—RIAAiag &LO_index=l&school_id=549#lenrollment l/l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool52o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015249.jpg": "Northwestern Law School for prosecutors and Fordham University, NY\n\ndefense atorneys Legal Aid Society, NY\nCook County Public Defenders AIDS Survey Research Methodology\nInternational Congress of Psychology, Sydney, Conference, Rockville, MD\n\nAustralia (Keynote) Course for prosecuting and defense atorneys,\nMedico Legal Society of Queensland, Northwestern Law\n\nAustralia American Psych Assn, San Francisco, CA\nBrigham Young University Law School University of Toronto\nBYU Psychology Department Ontario Science Centre\nBaylor University Law School Chief Executive Organization Forum,\nUniversity of California, San Diego Vancouver\nUniversity of Washington Law School University of Georgia (Wm.

The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9867", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019868.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN IOSdtuUM Ent /2o FilesOOAH2o2 P ahageb26ioLo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9868", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019881.jpg": "Cast F-26-C2oDSSOASN Bocturhert l8 Heo PA Ooo Pager of 26o\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment.

For example, in United States v. Ward, 63 F. Supp. 2d l2o3 (C.D.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n* Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84):\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “\\clircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83): and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\nreasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\nairest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether\nreasonable bail conditions can be set, and it shous that the proposed set of conditions will\nreasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo29", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020070.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctIMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FHgPagetl Oost 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).

Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight.’” United States v.

But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v.

First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol32", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020134.jpg": "CaGadeZOtepQ)d3GOuAuNt Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2o9o Faget 7l Ob 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol34", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020136.jpg": "CaGade2o epQ)o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget J Gb 22\nany person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol36", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020148.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag PageRiss 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force.

Other motions seek dismissal of\nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious\nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These\nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant\ngranting bail on the conditions proposed.\nIi. The Court Should Grant Bail\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act of l984, a defendant must be released on personal\nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release\nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of\nany other person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b).

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity.

The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d l24l, l243 (loth Cir.\n' All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020214.jpg": "Casse :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesumePAtl BOR l FROG O22o6 24g Aagee t6l6\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020215.jpg": "Cased 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BU l FROG O22o6/2agFAageo’ 6l6\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020216.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAt BO l FROG o22o6 /2agFages8 6l6\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020217.jpg": "Cased :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BO l FROG O22o6 24g Fagecd F6l6\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020218.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2atauivient DecuMdl BA62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pao diol66l6\nis not a valid reason to deny Mr. Robertson release because the government has not come forward\nwith any details to corroborate N.F.’s account or to link Mr. Robertson to the alleged contact.\n\nMore importantly, the Court has imposed a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions of release that it believes will be more than sufficient to reasonably assure Mr.\nRobertson’s appearance and the safety of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. Mr. Robertson will be placed at La\nPasada Halfway House, where he will be on home incarceration with active GPS tracking, the\nstrictest form of location monitoring available to the Court. Doc. 3ol at 2. He will not be alloued\nto leave La Pasada for any reason other than to meet with his atorneys, and he will not be alloued\nto transport himself to those meetings; his atorneys will have to transport him. /d. He will not be\nalloued any visitors at La Pasada except for his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to use or\npossess a cellphone, nor to borrou anyone else’s cellphone. /d. He will not be alloued to use the\nlandline at La Pasada, except to speak to his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to have contact\nwith anyone other than his Pretrial Services officer and his atorneys. /d. That includes no contact\nwith his family members until he shous the Court that he is fully compliant with all of his\nconditions of release. /d. He will not be alloued to use or possess drugs or alcohol. /d. He will\nbe alloued to participate in counseling at La Pasada to help him cope with the stress of his looming\ntrial. Jd. He will be required to abide by all rules and regulations of the halfway house, houever\nsmall. Jd.\n\nThe Court believes that with all of these conditions, and under the close supervision of the\nstaff at La Pasada and his Pretrial Services officer, Mr. Robertson will not pose a danger to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> or a risk of flight. The Court also cautioned Mr. Robertson at the February 4, 2o2l\npretrial conference that if he violates any of these conditions of release, the Court will not hesitate\nto reincarcerate him immediately. The Court accordingly finds that there are conditions, or a\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020219.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdl BA62 Filke662o6/Phg Peoye dill66l6\ncombination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020257.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page23 of 25\nfive hours of video-teleconference calls with her counsel every weekday.

Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The\n\ncontemporaneous emails shou that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered\nmultiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the\nstate plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear\nthat as the negotiations intensified in September 2oo7, the prosecutors became increasingly\nfrustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and\nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.\nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning\n53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l253", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021254.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8o 3536o38, Page82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.®’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control”®* in lieu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility. Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control,\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l254", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021255.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8l 3536o38, Page83 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8l of 348\n\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed.\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\nag The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l255", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021264.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Eoo 3536o38, Page92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9o of 348\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou ... a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and .. . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !°°\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\n\nlo Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021268.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO eNO4 3536o38, Page96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021272.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA_o8 3536o38, Pageloo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!!° Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\ntime in state custody.\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'’ This morning Jay\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\neligible.\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On the\nfirst one he gets l2 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets\nHs FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permiting the\ngovernment to withhold the requested records.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021278.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagelo6 of 258\nSA-lo4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo4 of 348\nI. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach ... an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l278", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021279.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONS 3536o38, Pagelo7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 348\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\n\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open “a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point .. . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation.

Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.'?” Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]....”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021280.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo6 3536o38, Pagelo8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so ’d want [M]arie on the call[.] [Pll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control; and amended the § 2255 provision.’\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. l”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in aplea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl3 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\na Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021283.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo9 3536o38, Pagell of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 348\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case... simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [MJarie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021285.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OTT 3536o38, Pagell3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

[He] also is telling Chief\n\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed.\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.’”* At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.'”\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “‘as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison.

POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control supervision\nprogram.

In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\n86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\ntsi The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was ‘fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021439.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA 963 3536o39, Page of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 263 of 348\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.*”°\nC. July 2oo8: Villafaia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a ‘Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\nao As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021500.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page/o of 2l7\nSA-324\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

Relevant Facts\n\nIn 2oo5, the Palm Beach Police Department in\nFlorida opened an investigation into Epstein on the\ncomplaint of the parents of a fourteen-year-old girl.\nThe Palm Beach Police ultimately brought the investi-\ngation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in West\nPalm Beach, which in turned opened an investigation\nwith the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern Dis-\ntrict of Florida “USAO-SDFL’). (SA3). That investiga-\ntion culminated in a draft sixty-page indictment pro-\nposing to charge Epstein for the sexual abuse of multi-\nple victims. (SA3).\n\nIn 2oo7, the USAO-SDFL and Epstein entered into\na non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). (A.l73). The\nagreement was signed “on the authority of R. Alexan-\nder Acosta, United States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida.” (A.l75). Under the terms of the\nNPA, Epstein agreed to plead guilty in a pending Flor-\nida state case and to receive a sentence of at least\neighteen months’ imprisonment and twelve months’\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. (A.l76). He also consented to juris-\ndiction in the Southern District of Florida for civil suits\ninvolving victims specified by the USAO-SDFL, among\nother terms. (A.l77). In exchange, USAO-SDFL\nagreed to defer “prosecution in this District.” (A.l75).\nOnce Epstein completed his half of the bargain, the\nNPA provided that “no prosecution” for the offenses\nthen under investigation by “the Federal Bureau of In-\nvestigation and the U.S. Atorney’s Office ... will be\ninstituted in this District.” (A.l75).\n\nThe NPA also provided that, if Epstein complied\nwith the agreement, “the United States also agrees\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l674", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021716.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page69 of 93\n56\nB. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) permits\na district court to “vacate any judgment and grant a\nnew trial if the interest of justice so requires.” As this\nCourt has explained, “[t]he defendant bears the bur-\nden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under\nRule 33, and before ordering a new trial pursuant to\nRule 33, a district court must find that there is a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been con-\nvicted.” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475\n(2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nPost-verdict inquiries into juror conduct are\nstrongly disfavored. Such inquiries “seriously disrupt\nthe finality of the process.” Tanner v. United States,\n483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l (l987). Permiting “post-verdict\nscrutiny of juror conduct” would undermine pillars\nthat undergird the jury trial right, including “full and\nfrank discussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness\nto return an unpopular verdict, and the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>’s\ntrust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeo-\nple.” Jd. Such inquiries may instead “lead to evil con-\nsequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting\njuryroom deliberation, burdening courts with merit-\nless applications, increasing temptation for jury tam-\npering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nUnited States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir.\nl989).\n\nAccordingly, a defendant seeking Rule 33 relief\nbased on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a stringent two-part test. First, a\nparty must “demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire.” McDonough\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021769.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page27 of 35\nAll three forms of bias must be \"grounded in facts developed at voir dire.\" Torres,\nl28 F.3d at 47.\n\nThe bias implied by the juror’s false answers went unexplored. Nieves turned\non the court’s failure to explore juror bias related to gangs — a prejudice analogous\nto the systematic or pervasive bias in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> against accused sex traffickers\nand those who consort with them. Maxwell, tied to Epstein by media coverage, went\nto trial against a constant drumbeat of news and allegations concerning child\nmolesters and sex trafficking. Far more pervasive than fear of gang violence was\nfear and revulsion as to child sex abuse and trafficking of which Epstein, and then\nMaxwell became the poster child. In the hearing, and despite defense suggested\nquestions, the Court refused to explore Juror 5o’s child sexual abuse for bias.\n\nTo assess a challenge for cause as to this seated juror after trial the court\nshould use the same standards for cause challenges at trial. To do otherwise would\nappear to shield the verdict rather than the defendant from improper juror bias. As\nin Nieves, the juror’s omited information related to a “material issue” that was at\ntrial “the cornerstone of the government’s theory.” There was a strong likelihood\nthat the material issue would skew deliberations considering the strong feelings that\nsex trafficking of minors engenders. See Nieves; see also Barnes, 6o4 F.2d at l37-\nl39. The court deprived Maxwell unfairly of the opportunity post-trial to unearth a\npervasive bias relevant to the issue pivotal to the case against her.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l769", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021937.jpg": "; Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document8 Filed ll/l9/l9 Page 6 of lo |\nAQ l99B (Rev, l2/ll) Additional Conditions of Release Page sof ss“ Pages\nADDITIONAL CONDITIONS OF RELEASE\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant’s release is subject to the conditions marked belou: |\nl\n(El) (6) The defendant is placed in the custody of:\nPerson or organization .\nAddress (only if above is an organization) ~ ~ , 7 ~ \" / ~ a\nCity and state _ - 7 - Tel, No. /\nwho agrees to (a) supervise the defendant, (b) use every effort to assure the defendant’s appearance at all court proceedings, and (c) notify the court immediatel |\nif the defendant violates a condition of release or is no longer in the custodian’s custody.\nSigned: - en 4\nCustodian Date\n(J) (7) The defendant must:\n(SJ) (a) submit to supervision by and report for supervision to the PRETRIAL SERVICES , 3\ntelephone number _ __, ho later than _ / Co\n((])} (b) continue or actively seek employment. 7 7 : —_\n(LJ) (c) continue or start an education program.\n(EX) (a) surrender any passport to: PRETRIAL SERVICES\n(EX) ) (e) not obtain a passport or other international travel document. . / - - ; / |\n(l) (f) abide by the follouing restrictions on personal association, residence, or travel: SDNY / EDNY / DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY |\nI\n(Cl) (@) avoid all contact, directly or indirectly, with any person who is or may be a victim or witness in the investigation or prosecution, :\nincluding,\n(Cl) (hy getmedical or psychiatric treatment? _ |\n(O) @ ‘return to custody each 7 ___ at : ‘o'clock after being released at - ___ o'clock for employment, schooling, |\nor the follouing purposes: _ _ - _ . . ; . |\n(Cl) maintain residence at a halfway house or <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> corrections center, as the pretrial services office or supervising officer considers _ |\nnecessary.\n(BJ) (k) not possess a firearm, destructive device, or other weapon. |\n(El) (@) notuse alcohol ( (l) )atall ¢ } excessively.\n(Cl) (m) not use or unlawfully possess a narcotic drug or other controlled substances defined in 2l U.S.C. § 8o2, unless prescribed by a license\nmedical practitioner. |\n(Cl) {n) submit to testing for a prohibited substance if required by the pretrial services office or supervising officer.

After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public.

After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\na Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control,\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody.

Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023102.jpg": "noted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim.

This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023110.jpg": "we go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023116.jpg": "l.

She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure.

As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023117.jpg": "I think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open “a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A ]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [MJarie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023118.jpg": "precluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] [ll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control; and amended the § 2255 provision.'”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !”4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing ina plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023121.jpg": "Lefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023123.jpg": "agreement.

[He] also is telling Chief\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'’? Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\n<span class=\"highlight\">Community</span> Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.” At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions.

The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison.

In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nls The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l56", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.jpg": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023207.jpg": "investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023275.jpg": "no federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.*”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023336.jpg": "signature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse.

These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York).

When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates.

The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span>, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023415.jpg": "harming others. Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein. According to\nher report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The\nreport further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,\nintention, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to\nmake phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly\nphone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and\ndid not appear to be in any distress. The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any\nunusual behaviors related to Epstein. She provided Epstein with supportive interventions and\n\n48\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023483.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 2 of 3\nIn April of this year, BOP’s leadership announced ts new mission as \"corrections professionals\nwho foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals\nfor successful reentry into our communities.\" BOP’s new core values include accountability,\nintegrity, respect, compassion, and correctional excellence. Of note, our core value of\naccountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public,\nourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,\nand the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is commited to\nproviding a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.\nRecommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate\nfollouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in\ncustody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.\nOur practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved\nand overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP\nhas updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP’s\nrevised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists\nmake individualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial\nconcerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees\nwork collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\nappropriately.\nRecommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for\nsuicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate\nre-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023736.jpg": "— —\nIII, POLICY\nBureau of Prisons policy states a pretrial inmate may not be compelled to work other than to perform\nhousekeeping tasks in the inmate’s oun cell and in the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> living area.\nFOR STAFF USE\nONLY\nI am referring this inmate to the institution’s psychologist/psychiatrist because:\nThe inmate’s behavior suggests the inmate may not be able to comprehend this waiver.\n___The inmate has been admited for mental evaluation or treatment.\na\nStaff Signature/Printed Name /Title Date\nIV.

Inmates Telephone System (ITS)\nThe Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as\npart of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28\nC.F.R. §$54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> and family ties that may contribute to an\ninmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassiqned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to Gisciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not atorney-client privileged calls.

These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida.

It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous |\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and |\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of |\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tumed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney’s office handed doun one indictment of |\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-E] (cirea the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening. There are nou four on the litle island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast . zy\nfounder Danny Abraham. Jose Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, “Half my —o |\nsources on the island are Jewish socialites.” (\\Q .. i—=> No ot CaP ane Bor fe yoeslee\nLambiet says the case has fed rage within the <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have touho\ndo time. William Kennedy Smith in l99l, Rush Limbaugh, lately Ann Coulter for a voting infraction. 7 Ss\nMaybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein’s two big ap hd\ncharitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershouitz and Rubenstein are also major,\nIsrae] supporters. Dershouitz has writen a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Nou throu v\nin the fact that the Palm Beach police asked at least three of the girls whether they had noticed whether (leak t\nEpstein was circumcised. “I asked ... if she knew what being circumcised meant,” the officer ate in :\nregard to the l4-year-old, ho wv «A a> WHA b\nOf course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police narrative seem to derive more from Je Wi A\nEdgar Allan Poe’s psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth’s sociological comedies. Epstein is —\nlicensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shouer on the first floor was\ngiven over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had\na Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Nou he was licensed\nin the Virgin Islands and gave his “permanent residence” as the same address as Island Yachts.\nNotwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and\njoyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the\nsensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.\nhte eho orinthia.clickshilitv com/nt/entTackeieonee lle= Thet Rantseier EUG Recida Rewes!

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and <span class=\"highlight\">community</span> colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and ;\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of = #f\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tummed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney's office handed doun one indictment of\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-El (circa the sixties), says he strong!y doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening.

Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator which is large and white in color. Robson told\nEpstein, I’Jl massage you but I don’t want to be touched.\nRobson stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $2oo.oo\nfor the massage. He explained, I knou you’re not comfortable, but I’Il pay you if you bring some girls.

While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is\nhardly the measure of the man. To those who have knoun him long or intimately, he is\na loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the\nscientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his\nlargesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most\nimportantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary\ncitizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding\n\nperson, mentor, and friend. .\n\nPersonal History\nJeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in\n. l953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was\nraised in modest louer middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish\n: neighborhood. Jeffrey’s father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City\nParks Department. Jeffrey’s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in\nhigh school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:\nhis youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment\nfrom which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a\n' normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.\n\nJeffrey atended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident\nearly on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. l88 and was subsequently placed in a special\nprogram which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High\nSchool. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayete High\nSchool in l969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey\natended Cooper Union in Manhatan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.\nJeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York\nUniversity. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for\nspending money.\n\nl .\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3322l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033228.jpg": "disciplined in business and conscientious.

Jeffrey\nhas been extraordinarily generous to a host of educational, wellness, civic, and scientific\norganizations. Between 2ooo and 2oo6 he donated personally, through his business and\ninterests, and through foundations be had established,” a total exceeding $l6,ooo,ooo.\nThe good generated by his largesse is suggested in the follouing examples.\n\nJeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps\nnone more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span> at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n. At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,\nbut in essence this is what happened.\n\nJeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly\ndid not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also\nparticipate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had\ndecided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on\n. the building because I had been associated with the institution for such a\n‘ long time. I fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion\nand greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor\nbut without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no\nbuilding. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no °\nnew building and that would have been an enormous loss to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">community</span>.\n, The building that nou stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-\nRadcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a\nnoteworthy aspect of Jeffrey’s giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his\n2 The Jeffrey Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc. and the C.o.U.Q.
