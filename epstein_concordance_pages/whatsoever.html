Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\n<span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000334.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 6ofl4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 6\ncontained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000335.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 7 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 7\n2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community\n\nThe dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “guarantee”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span>. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug.\n3, 2ol5); United States v. Young, Nos. l2 Cr. 5o2, l2 Cr. 645, 2ol3 WL l2l3l3oo, at *7 (D. Utah\nAug. 27, 2ol3); United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547, 2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D.\nCal. Dec. 2o, 2olo); United States v. Bohn, 33o F. Supp. 2d 96o, 96l (W.D. Tenn. 2oo4); United\nStates v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. l39, 2ooo WL l832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2ooo); United States\nv. Botero, 6o4 F. Supp. lo28, lo35 (S.D. Fla. l985). . The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\nexpensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000340.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l2 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l2\nIV. The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here\n\nFinally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the\nappropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and\ncertainly none should give the Court any comfort <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> that the defendant would, if granted\nbail, refrain from fleeing so he could atempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.\nNevertheless, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn.\n\nA. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution\n\nAs an initial mater, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this\nweek, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond\nthe scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New\nYork based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient\nto put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious\nchallenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and\nadditional charges brought based on New York conduct.\n\nBut more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District\nof New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA\noverwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to\nthe SDFL. The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander\nAcosta, United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for\nthese offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final\nparagraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms\nof the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this\nAgreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that\narose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.”\n\nIn its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed\nas an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as\nto any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA,\nand additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil\nsetlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver\nof any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.” These provisions shou the parties\ncontemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not\ninitially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final\nsubstantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.”\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “‘a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n7 All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000523.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document36- Filed o7/24/l9 Page l3 of 74 l3\n\nl obtained records from a financial institution that has been\n\n2 associated with the defendant confirming that the defendant\n\n3 represented his net worth as more than $5oo million.\n\n4 Your Honor, just as one example, the defendant had a single\n\n5 account at that financial institution totaling more than $llo\n\n6 million.\n\n7 There can be no dispute <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> that this defendant\n8 has vast assets and every incentive in the world to use those\n\n9 assets to flee from justice.\n\nlo Your Honor, the government seeking detention in this\nll case is not unusual.

Stated differently, the government has\ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms.\nMaxwell participated in Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse, or “groomed” them for Epstein, or had\nanything <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced.\nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the\ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still\nfundamentally inconsistent with the government’s theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein’s\n“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.\n\nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government’s theory of the perjury\ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2). That is incorrect. The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 35 of 9l 35\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl relative of the defendant and the other appears to be a close\n\n2 associate.\n\n3 Despite having put millions of dollars into this\n\n4 trust, your Honor, and despite its assets being controlled by a\niy relative and close associate, the defendant mentions it not\n\n6 once in her motion before the court or in her Pretrial Services\n7 interview; and, in fact, despite the fact that the government\n\n8 said in its opening brief that the defendant's finances and her\n9 uncertain amount of wealth, including issues about whether her\nlo wealth was stored abroad, are serious concerns with respect to\nll the defendant's risk of flight, the defendant's opposition does\nl2 not discuss this at all.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up [by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . [including] flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovernment represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.” The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span>, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed.

In particular, in arguing that the “co-\nconspirator” provision lacks any temporal or statutory limitations <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span>, the defendant seems\nto claim that the NPA immunized her for future crimes including, for example, perjury offenses\nthat she is charged with commiting almost a decade after the NPA was executed. (Def. Mot. l at\n32 (“For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the\nindictment.”)). Although the defendant does not highlight this point in her motion—perhaps\nrecognizing hou absurd it would be—that is the natural consequence of her illogical interpretation\nof the NPA. Despite advancing an argument that strains common sense, the defendant cites no\ncase in which a court has interpreted a plea agreement to bar prosecution for crimes that pre- or\npost-dated the period covered by the agreement. The Government is aware of no such authority.\nSee United States v. Hallahan, 756 F.3d 962, 974 (7th Cir. 2ol4) (rejecting defense argument that\nplea agreement barred prosecution for subsequent bail jumping, and, in interpreting the\n° By its plain terms, the NPA did not immunize Epstein for his “background,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Mot. l at 27). This provision refers, instead, to a list of “offenses” under federal\nlaw. Indeed, it is unclear hou any plea agreement could immunize a defendant’s “background.”\nSimilarly, the fact that the USAO-SDFL interviewed Minor Victim-2 does not mean that this case\n“arose out of” the USAO-SDFL investigation, an assertion the defendant’s motion does not explain\nor support with evidence. As the Indictment makes clear, the events underpinning the Indictment\ninvolve multiple victims and specific legal charges that were not within the scope of the USAO-\nSDFL investigation. As discussed in greater detail belou, Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-3\nwere never interviewed by the USAO-SDFL, and they did not agree to speak with law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll7 of 239\n\nThe defendant repeatedly argues that the Government’s failure to mention AUSA-l’s prior\ncontact with Boies Schiller in 2ol6 was a misrepresentation that led to the modification of the\nprotective order. The argument, which relies principally on hyperbolic rhetoric, is simply\nincorrect. As an initial mater, the Government did not insist, contrary to Maxwell’s twisted\nreading of the transcript, that “there had been no contact <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span>” between Boies Schiller and\nthe Government at any time prior to the Government opening its investigation. (Def. Mot. 3 at l).\nInstead, Chief Judge McMahon’s question was more specific: referencing Chemical Bank and the\ndesire to avoid “a Chemical Bank kind of situation,” Chief Judge McMahon asked about contacts\nbetween the two parties “prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation.”\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added); see also Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (omiting the italicized portion\nof the question)). In response, the Government described accurately its communications with\nBoies Schiller that had occurred in the time period surrounding the opening of its investigation and\nthe issuance of the subpoena. Additionally, and in light of the Government’s prior arguments to\nChief Judge McMahon relating to Chemical Bank,*® the Government atempted to address the\nmisconduct at issue in that case: namely the production of confidential documents without seeking\nmodification of a protective order by confirming that, here, no such production had yet occurred.\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2) (noting that Boies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there\n* See, e.g., Exs. 8 & 9 at 2-3 (discussing Chemical Bank as rejecting a contempt request where a\nparty “compl[ied] with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order” and\nfocusing arguments on the nature of the production of documents); (Def.

Nor has Ms. Maxwell\nhad the opportunity to question those involved in the investigation and negotiation. It is patently\nunreasonable for the government to blame Ms. Maxwell for failing to produce evidence relating\nto the investigation and negotiation leading up to the NPA, while simultaneously opposing her\nrequest for discovery and cherry-picking its responses to the limited publicly available\ninformation she has been able to identify.

The co-\nconspirator immunity provision simply does not contain the limitations the government nou\nseeks to atribute to it, and Ms. Maxwell’s position that it prohibits the Mann Act charges against\nher is entirely reasonable.*\n\nFirst, the government’s assertion that “the NPA contains detailed provisions that limit the\nscope of the crimes immunized in the agreement” is simply not true. See Opp. l5. The NPA\ncontains only vague limitations as to the scope of Epstein’s immunity, and no limitations\n<span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> as to the scope of immunity for potential co-conspirators.\n\n* To be clear, Ms. Maxwell does not assert that the NPA forecloses the perjury counts of the Indictment, which arise\nout of alleged post-NPA conduct.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo389o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 23 of 34\ncontacts with Boies Schiller on the topic of Epstein any more than he shared the contacts on the\ntopic of Maxwell—he simply denied any contacts had occurred, something that is demonstrably\nfalse.\n\nWhether Boies Schiller “pitched” a prosecution of Epstein only or of Epstein and\nMaxwell as a duo, AUSA JJ misled Judge McMahon by denying there was any “pitch”\n<span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span>.\n\nIII. The Materiality of the Government’s False Statements.\n\nThe government halfheartedly suggests that “there is no reason to believe that a\ndescription of the February 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s\nanalysis of whether she was facing a ‘Chemical Bank kind of situation.’”” Resp. at 9l. Hardly. In\nfact, there is every reason to believe Judge McMahon would have refused to authorize the\nsubpoena if AUSA gg had not so misled her.\n\nHou do we knou?

The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\nconspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a conspiracy\ndoes not require a completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\ndemonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “subjective\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any relevance <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> to an alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that relevance certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters. The\ngovernment’s intention to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 9ofl6\nMaxwell cannot effectively prepare her defense and will be at risk of further “surprise”\nallegations on the eve of trial. See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars necessary to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is irrelevant to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only necessary so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case. See United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4, 33\n(D.D.C. l998) (ordering a bill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial\nagreement” and whether and hou certain allegations “were within the scope of the conspiracy\ncharged”).4\nI.

(Dkt. l48 at l4-l5). In response,\nthe government does not atempt to rebut Ms. Maxwell’s justifications for accelerated disclosure\nof these materials.

(/d. at l7). In her current\nmotion, the defendant offers no additional factual claims in support of her argument that the\npassage of time has prejudiced her defense. She instead refers the Court back to her prior\nhypothetical, vague, and conclusory claims of prejudice that do not withstand scrutiny. The\ndefendant has not remotely carried her “heavy burden” of proof. Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. Her\nrenewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment\ndelay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nBecause the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the\ndefendant’s specious arguments that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment\ndelay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. See United States v. Pierre-\nLouis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). In any event, in\ndenying the defendant’s pre-trial motions filed in January, the Court noted the absence of\n“evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Apr. Op. at l7). That remains true.\n\nThe defendant argues that the “S2 Indictment only compounds [the excessive pre-\nindictment delay] issues by charging additional offenses based on alleged conduct that the\ngovernment has knoun about since in or about 2oo7, which it added for tactical reasons to shore\nup its case against Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. at 22).

By contrast, the Second Circuit found that the government’s evidence in A/-Sadawi was\n“too atenuated” to establish that the defendant intended to flee to avoid prosecution or\napprehension and the government should not have been permited to argue consciousness of guilt\non the basis of that evidence. /d.\n\nHere, the purported “flight” evidence is even more atenuated than in Al-Sadawi. Like\nAl-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell knew she was a subject of the government’s investigation after the\narrest of Jeffery Epstein and could have left the country at any point in the one-year period\nleading up to her arrest (nine-and-a-half months longer than Al-Sadawi). But she did not.\n\nUnlike Al-Sadawi, there is no evidence <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> that Ms. Maxwell was preparing to flee.\nNeither Ms. Maxwell nor her spouse had purchased a plane ticket, nor was Ms. Maxwell\nplanning to move locations. On the contrary, Ms. Maxwell had been living in the same residence\nin New Hampshire for seven months — a location she chose because it was close to her family\nand close to the prosecutors in New York in case she needed to meet with them. Moreover,\nwhen Ms. Maxwell was arrested, the arresting agents found nothing suggesting that she planned\nto abscond. Finally, unlike A/-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell proffered independent evidence supporting\nan alternative explanation for her actions that rebuts any inference that she intended to flee.\n\nHence, if it was improper for the trial court to allou the introduction of flight evidence in\nAl-Sadawi, it would be even more improper for the Court to do so here.

The defense expert\nnotice includes four other sets of opinions that supposedly respond to Dr. Rocchio but do not\nsatisfy the Daubert standard. First, the expert notice—which closely parallels the defense’s\nDaubert motion—improperly discusses the facts of this particular case and comments on various\nlegal documents, even though it offers no basis <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> to conclude that Dr. Dietz has any legal\nexpertise or has reliably applied any expertise to the facts of this case. In particular, the notice\nstates that Dr. Dietz will opine that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on grooming “carries the risk of\nimputing motive and intent to the Defendant” (Ex. A at 3), that “Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of ‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,”\nand that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for herself,”\nbut instead that she “recruited and groomed minors to provide sexualized massages for Mr.\nEpstein” (id. at 4). These opinions, while potentially relevant to the Court’s consideration of a\nDaubert motion, are not properly put before a jury.\n\nSecond, certain of Dr. Dietz’s opinions about grooming are not themselves reliable or\ninvade the province of the jury. In particular, it is circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive\nand intent,” because grooming is defined to be a strategic patern of behavior used to develop\nrelationships of atachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. (Ex. A at 3). That is,\nif the behaviors lack the requisite motive and intent, they are not grooming behaviors. If Dr.\nDietz’s point is that determining motive and intent is for the factfinder (id.), the Government\nagrees—and Dr. Dietz should not be permited to testify that grooming behaviors “impute[] motive\nand intent without adequate evidence.” (/d.) The adequacy of the evidence is a question for the\njury. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will inform the jury about the existence of grooming behaviors, but\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 4l\nProp., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts to act as . .. vehicles for factual\nnarrative”). This “opinion” should be precluded.\n\n4. Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault”\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions regarding the existence of false allegations of\nsexual assault and the “multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault” (Ex. A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate circumstances and\npersonality traits, with no shouing of any connection to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual assault—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion. To appreciate the audacity of the defense approach, consider\nif the Government atempted to do something similar. If the defense put on witnesses at trial, and\nthe Government then called in rebutal an expert psychiatrist to offer opinions on “Pathways to\nFalse Exculpatory Testimony” who opined that a variety of circumstances or mental conditions\ncould hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a defendant, it is\nsafe to assume that the defense would object. What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2. Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “[flalse allegations of sexual\nassault do occur” (Ex. A at 7), is not helpful to the jury. There will be no dispute that allegations\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006302.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of:\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\n<span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2l of 43 2l\nLalWmaxC\n\nl is, Ms. Sternheim.\n\n2 MS.

That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst.

The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant.

Overt Acts\n\nCounts Three and Five of the S2 Indictment charged different overt acts. There is no\noverlap <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> in the overt acts between these two counts in the S2 Indictment. The defendant\ndoes not appear to argue otherwise, (see Def.

The absence of\noverlapping overt acts underscores the fact that these counts charged different conspiracies.\nAccordingly, this factor weighs strongly against the defendant’s claim of multiplicity.\n\n3. Overlap in Participants\n\nTurning to the overlap of participants, the evidence at trial established that some—but\nimportantly, not all—participants overlapped between the two conspiracy schemes charged in\nCounts Three and Five. In any event, even if the participants had been identical in both\nconspiracies, the identity of the participants alone would be insufficient to support a claim of\nmultiplicity. See United States v.

See Dkt. No. l87, § 25(d). At trial, a victim who testified under her first name, Carolyn,\ntestified about receiving such calls from Sarah Kellen, who worked as a personal assistant to\nEpstein. (Tr. l527). The evidence at trial established that Kellen started working for Epstein in\nor about the early 2ooos. (See, e.g., Tr. 832, l889).

No. 2o7 at l7; Dkt. No.\n3l7 at lo). If anything, the trial record undermined the defendant’s argument on this prong. In an\neffort to shou the victims’ supposed financial motivations for testifying, the defendant repeatedly\nfocused the jury’s atention on the fact that victims only recently agreed to cooperate with the\nGovernment. That same evidence precludes any argument of intentional delay by the Government.\nThe defendant’s renewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon\npre-indictment delay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009610.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 48 of5l\n\nBecause the defendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of establishing either element of\nunconstitutional delay, Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752, let alone both, her motion to vacate her\nconviction or dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay is meritless and should be denied.\n\nIV.

Mot. at 3o). The Court\nshould reject those arguments as it has before.\n\nThe defendant has only offered a specific challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as to\nCounts One and Two, the enticement counts. Specifically, the defendant argued that the record\nlacked sufficient evidence that the defendant “or anyone else who allegedly participated in this\nconspiracy persuaded, induced, or enticed Jane to travel to New York to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity.” (Tr. 2266-67; see Tr. 2269-7o (“There is not testimony <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> that Ghislaine\nMaxwell encouraged [Jane] to travel.”)). Of course, the jury acquited the defendant on Count\nTwo, the substantive enticement count. As to Count One, the jury could have readily concluded\nthat the defendant conspired with Epstein to groom minor victims and entice them to travel to\nEpstein’s various properties, including his home in New York, to be sexually abused. For instance,\nJane testified that she was abused by Epstein and the defendant in New York. (Tr. 32o). And the\nrecord is replete with testimony regarding the manner in which the defendant worked with Epstein\nto groom minor victims and entice them to travel to Epstein’s properties.

This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial.

The adjustment is typically applied to defendants (virtually\nall of whom are male) who repeatedly and often violently sexually abuse or exploit children for\ntheir oun sexual gratification and who are caught soon after or while still engaging in that\nbehavior. See, e.g., Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 284-88; United States v. Suarez, No. 2l-l72l, 2o22\nWL l449l74, at *l-*2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2o22); United States v.

Feb. l, 2o22).\n\nIn sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell has never been accused of any sex offenses—or any\ncrimes, for that mater—in the almost 2o-year period since the conduct at issue in this case\nended. There is absolutely no evidence that Ms. Maxwell is atracted to minors or has the sort of\nuncontrollable impulses that would compel her to re-offend. According to the trial record, it was\nEpstein who had such proclivities, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was to facilitate Epstein’s sexual\nabuse. Indeed, after she moved on from Epstein in the early 2ooos, Ms. Maxwell was involved\nin two long-term relationships with men who had young children and was actively involved in\ntheir lives without even the slightest hint of impropriety. Most importantly, the government\nconcedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community. The government never made that\nassertion in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous bail applications and there is no evidence\n<span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> to support such a claim. Put simply, Ms. Maxwell is not “dangerous” and there is no\nrisk that Ms. Maxwell will ever “repeat” the offense. Accordingly, there is no basis to apply\n§ 4Bl.5, which is meant to apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.\n\nThe government asserts that § 4Bl.5 should apply as long as the offense conduct fits\nwithin the text of the guideline, to which it claims to be faithfully adhering. See PSR at 6o. It is\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo434\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 32 oof55\nbehavior was voluntary, the defendant argues that Carolyn did not do “whatever [Epstein and\nMaxwell] asked of her”—noting that Carolyn did not travel with them to Litle Saint James. (Def.\nMem. 2l). But that shous only that their undue influence was not all-consuming, not that they\nlacked influence <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span>. The standard is “‘undue influence,’ not coercion.” United States v.\nMontijo-Maysonet, 874 F.3d 34, 52 (lst Cir. 2o2o).\n\nThe defendant also argues that application of this enhancement would constitute double-\ncounting because the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six covers her conduct\nenticing and coercing minors. (Def. Mem. 2o). This argument lacks merit. As the defendant\ncorrectly notes, “[i]mpermissible double counting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is\napplied to increase the defendant’s sentence to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully\naccounted for by another part of the Guidelines.” Watkins, 667 F.3d at 26l. But “when the\nchallenged part of the Guidelines aim[s] at different harms emanating from the same conduct, there\nis no impermissible double counting,” and “[e]nhancements are not duplicative when they reflect\ndifferent facets of the defendant’s conduct.” Jd. at 26l-62 (alterations, citations, and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThe relevant inquiry therefore is whether the base offense level is aimed at the same harm\nas the enhancement. Here, it is not: the base offense level (which refers to § 2Gl.3) captures the\ncategory of sex offenses against minors, and § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) applies to the use of undue\ninfluence. See United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App’x 444, 446-47 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing\nthe focus of § 2Bl.3(b)(2)(B)); United States v. Arbaugh, 95l F. 3d l67, l73 (4th Cir. 2o2o) (“By\nits plain terms, § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) focuses on a different aggravating factor (undue influence) than\n§ 2Gl.3 (minor victims)... .

That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added).

While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s\ndesire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s\ninconsistent statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her\nmarriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States. As for the defendant’s asserted\nrelationships with a and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not\nappear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New\nHampshire, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States.

Abbasi, l37 S. Ct.\nl843, l857, l859 (2ol7)). In this case, the District Court did not just purport to\nfollou Annabi, but expanded its questionable doctrine into new and inapplicable\nterritory. In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.\n\nFirst, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal\ndistrict outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and\nprinciples of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution\ncanon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto\na plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.\n\nSecond, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672. And Annabi made clear that charges\nare “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.\nId. But here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct\nfrom 2ool through 2oo4 that falls entirely within the 2ool-2oo7 offense period\ncontemplated by the NPA. Therefore, Annabi is inapplicable at least as to Count\nSix.\n\nThird, Annabi and its predecessors involved situations where there was no\n“affirmative” indication <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> that the plea agreement was intended to bind\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021844.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Page2o of 5l\nId. Here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct from\n2ool through 2oo4 that falls entirely within the 2ool-2oo7 offense period\ncontemplated by the NPA.\n\nThird, Annabi should apply only if there are no “affirmative” indications\n<span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> that the plea agreement was intended to bind other USAOs. See Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 67l; Alessi, 544 F.2d at ll54; Papa, 533 F.2d at 823-25. That is not the\ncase here. Appellant produced ample evidence that the NPA was intended to bind\nother USAOs. See Appellant’s Principal Brief at 33-38. The investigation itself\nsuggests it was meant to bind the SDNY, in particular, because the investigation was\nactive in the SDNY at the time the NPA was negotiated. SA72, 84, 86, l27. See Doc 293\nat l6. Defense counsel understood the plea agreement to provide “genuine finality.”\nSAll8. This reasonable understanding, supported by the NPA itself and the limited\nnegotiation history contained in the one-sided OPR was sufficient to preclude\napplication of Annabi.\n\nFourth, at most, Annabi should apply, if at all, only after the court permits\ndiscovery and conducts an evidentiary hearing. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 67l; Papa,\n533 F.2d at 823.

Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence <span class=\"highlight\">whatsoever</span> that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.
