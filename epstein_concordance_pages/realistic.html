Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence?

Will the evidence in the case largely consist of testimony relating to documents\n\n(which by their nature are not easily altered)?\n\n4. Is there a <span class=\"highlight\">realistic</span> possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will\nincrease the likelihood that the prosecution's witnesses will not appear at trial, or\nwill be unwilling to testify at trial?\n\n5. Does the indictment allege offenses occurring over an extended period of time,\nmaking preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and difficult?\n\n6. Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their\ndefense?\n\nId. at 88l.\n\nHere, the application of the Turkish factors favors early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses. The indictment does not allege crimes of violence, Ms. Maxwell has no\ncriminal history, and the government has conceded that she is not a danger to the community.\nThe age of the charged offenses and the complications imposed by a global pandemic makes\ninvestigation and preparation of this case complex and difficult. Disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list is material to the preparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances surrounding this case.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l92 Filed o3/3l/2l Page lof3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nUnited States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis week’s filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating\nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the <span class=\"highlight\">realistic</span> concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003007.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 73 of 239\nomited)). The defendant has not and cannot establish that Epstein would have been available to\ntestify in the first instance, much less that he would have voluntarily agreed to testify at her trial\nin a way that would help, rather than hurt, the defendant.\n\nAs to Epstein’s mother, who died in April 2oo4, the defendant contends that she “would\nhave testified that she did not observe Ms. Maxwell with any Accusers between l994 and l997.”\n(Def. Mot. 7 at 9). “Counsel’s unsworn assertions as to vague generalities” that witnesses, “if\nalive, would give testimony helpful to [the defendant] do not shou that [the defendant’s] ability to\npresent a defense has been substantially and actually prejudiced.” United States v. Scala, 388 F.\nSupp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). Here, “there is no evidence before the Court as to what\n[the deceased witness] would have testified, much less specific evidence of hou losing that\ntestimony has caused [the defendant] actual prejudice.” Jd. at 4oo. Further, unless Epstein’s\nmother was with the defendant “every moment” between l994 and l997, “it would be impossible\nfor [her] to testify that [the] defendant did not commit the charged crimes, so whatever helpful\ntestimony [she] might have offered (the details of which are sparse in the motion) would be easily\nundermined on cross-examination.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (citing Spears, l59\nF.3d at lo8l-lo85). Moreover, Epstein’s mother died “sufficiently prior to ‘any <span class=\"highlight\">realistic</span> trial\ndate,’ to make it improbable that any prejudice it may have caused [the defendant] was the result\nof government delay.” United States v. Cheung Kin Ping, 555 F.2d lo69, lo73 (2d Cir. l977)\n(quoting United States v. Stein, 456 F.2d 844, 848 (2d Cir. l972)). Indeed, Epstein’s mother passed\naway before the Palm Beach Police Department even began investigating Epstein in 2oo5. (Def.\nMot. 7, Ex. D at i).\n\nThe defendant’s claims relating to Michael Casey and Detective Recarey fare no beter.\nShe again speculates that Casey and Detective Recarey, who passed away in August 2ol7 and May\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a <span class=\"highlight\">realistic</span> recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up).

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\nlaboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not <span class=\"highlight\">realistic</span> or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v. Randall, l9-Cr.-l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335.\n\nFor the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—\nthe Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability\nof Dr. Rocchio’s method.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method\nis unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page l2l of l27 l2l\nLBl5max4\n\nl respond to those issues tomorrou.
