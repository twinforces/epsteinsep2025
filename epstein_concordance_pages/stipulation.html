These suggestions are\ndisingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented. Finally, there is no other case that\ndefense counsel has located where [a\nee\nee\nCSC‘\nee\nThat Ms. Maxwell did not knou what was in the sealed materials before she signed the\nProtective Order, or proposed a draft, is self-evident. That a Court can modify a protective order\nat any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(l) authorizes the Court to\nregulate discovery through protective orders and modification of those orders. See Smith Kline\nBeecham Corp. v.

All twelve depositions\nwere taken “pursuant to a court-approved <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span> to the effect that the depositions should be\ntreated as confidential and used solely by the parties for prosecution or defense of the action.” Jd.\nat 292. Without seeking to intervene, and without serving a subpoena or warrant, the government\ncalled and then wrote to the district court to request access to the deposition transcripts. /d. at\n293. The government claimed that the deposition transcripts were relevant to its investigation of\nperjury, subordination of perjury, and conspiracy related to the l97o presidential election in\nChile. Jd. The government, “moreover, feared that unless it could obtain the deposition\ntranscripts, it would be unable to secure statements from the witnesses because they would claim\ntheir Fifth Amendment rights in any investigative interviews.” /d. The district court denied the\ngovernment’s request, “holding that the deposition testimony had been given in reliance upon the\nprotective order, thus rendering unnecessary invocation by the witnesses of their Fifth\nAmendment rights, that the requested turnover would raise constitutional issues, and that\nprinciples of fairness mandated enforcement of the protective order.” /d. The government\nappealed, and the Second Circuit affirmed.\n\nThe Second Circuit was blunt in explaining the government’s missteps:\n\nThe government may not .. . simply by picking up the telephone or writing a leter\n\nto the court (as was the case here), insinuate itself into a private civil lawsuit\n\nbetween others. The proper procedure, as the government should knou, was either\n\nto subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a\n\ngrand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to\n\nquash or modify the subpoena, see Rule l7(c), or to seek permissive intervention\n\nin the private action pursuant to Rule 24(b), for the purpose of obtaining vacation\n\nor modification of the protective order.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 239\nchoices reflected in the criminal discovery rules.” Jd. Second, doing so “risks invading ‘the\ninviolable function of the jury’ in our criminal justice system.’” /d. at 28l (citation omited).\nAccordingly, if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined with a\ndefendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” Jd.\n\nThe exception to this rule is “extraordinarily narrou” because, in the normal course, the\n“government must make a detailed presentation of the entirety of the evidence before a district\ncourt can dismiss an indictment on sufficiency grounds,” which the Government is not required to\ndo at the motion-to-dismiss stage. /d. at 282 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). That\npoint is underscored by United States v. Nitsche, 843 F. Supp. 2d 4 (D.D.C. 2oll), on which the\ndefendant relies. There, the district court dismissed an indictment in a child enticement case for\ninsufficiency of the evidence. First, houever, the court explained that the question was ripe\nbecause “(l) Defendant has stipulated to the entire record that is relevant to Count I; (2) the\nGovernment has had several opportunities to make a proffer of any additional facts, to conduct\nany subsequent investigation, and to ask the Court for further delay to seek more evidence; and (3)\nbecause the record is limited to the chat.” Jd. at 9. Accordingly, “[t]he transcripts themselves\nprovide the Court with all of the relevant undisputed facts to decide the motion.” /d. Here, of\ncourse, that is simply not the case and, in particular, there is no <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span> as to the entire relevant\nrecord.\n\nUnder the relevant legal standard, the defendant’s statements were material if they could\nhave led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the factfinder in the defendant’s\ncivil case. Evaluating that standard necessarily implicates facts beyond the deposition testimony\nitself and Judge Preska’s unsealing order,*’ such as identification of the allegedly defamatory\n°° The defendant observes that Judge Preska redacted some of the statements that form the basis\nof Count Six, stating that the “testimony is . . . far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003098.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 239\nstatements at the heart of that case and the evidence that might have been uncovered had the\ndefendant answered the questions truthfully. A jury should be alloued to hear the questions in\ncontext to evaluate their materiality, which cannot be done at this stage.*! The Court therefore\nshould deny the motion.\n\nIn any event, the perjurious statements were material in both senses of the definition. First,\nthe questions were aimed at developing a record in the civil suit that Epstein and the defendant\nrecruited Giuffre to Epstein’s Palm Beach property in the guise of hiring her as a masseuse, and\nthen sexualized that massage. Honest answers to those questions—for instance that Epstein in fact\nhad a scheme to recruit underaged girls for sexual massages—would have been corroborative of\nsome of Giuffre’s claims. Second, had the defendant honestly answered the deposition questions,\nGiuffre could have located other victims or witnesses who may have corroborated her testimony.\nBut in any event, the question of materiality should be put to the jury and is inappropriate for the\nCourt to resolve on a motion to dismiss without the benefit of the full factual record. The motion\nshould be denied.\nallegations that were central to the dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 4, Ex. I at 7:3-6.)\n(The last colloquy has been unsealed except for Minor Victim-2’s name. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP),\nDkt. No. l2l2-l).) Yet Judge Preska’s opinion as to the propriety of certain redactions in a civil\ncase is not controlling as to whether the Government can meet the elements of a criminal perjury\ncharge here. First, before Judge Preska were the defendant’s denials of various sexual activities,\nnot honest answers that would have been quite different. In part for that reason, Judge Sweet\nauthorized the deposition at the outset. Second, the Government was not a party to the civil\nunsealing litigation and did not have an opportunity to be heard on this issue before Judge Preska.\n>! While the Government is open to crafting a <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span> on the background of the Giuffre lawsuit\nto streamline presentation of these issues to the jury, it notes that the defendant’s summary of that\nsuit as set forth in her motion is incorrect. (£.g., Def. Mot. 4 at 2o (erroneously asserting that the\ndefamation claims at issue turned on Giuffre’s ability to prove salacious allegations about public\nofficials)).\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of\nthe civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span>—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span> or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a\npseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider\nGiuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\nconviction); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting instruction to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 3o\nApp.-o829\n2\nG4LMGIUC\n\nl wondering what the Court would like to do about that.\n\n2 THE COURT: First of all, you knou hou we play this\n\n3 game.

Judge Sweet made no specific findings about any provision\nof that order. Ud. 9:25—lo:6.)\n\nOn March l8, 2ol6, the court formally entered the Protective Order. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. )\nNo. 62.)

(Id. §§ l-5.) The Protective Order also required all parties, at the |\nconclusion of the case, either to return to the party who made the confidentiality designation, or |\n(in the alternative) to destroy, each document and all copies of Confidential Materials in their |\npossession. (Ic. 5-7, l2.) This destruction obligation extended to the parties’ lawyers as well |\nas to the parties themselves.

The docket sheet in Giuffre v. Maxwell reveals that such motions were |\nfrequently made and routinely granted. As a result, a vast amount of the Giuffre Action was |\nconducted, in effect, in secret—despite the fact that there was immense public interest in the |\nmater. | |\nThe Giuffre Action was setled and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a joint |\n<span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span> for dismissal on May 25, 2ol7, which was shortly before the trial was to begin.

ROHRBACH: So who lived in the home might have\n\nl8 marginal impeachment value, but the government's view is that\nl9 it's only marginal. The proffer we have from the defense nou\n2o is that, at most, the defendant lived in a home nearby before\n2l she moved to the 44 Kinnerton Street home. So to the extent\n22 that that's true -- and again, it's contradicted by the\n23 defendant's under-oath deposition testimony -- it would have\n24 only marginal impeachment value.

We thought if the <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span>\nl4 was going to have to involve that testimony, as well, we then\nl5 nou needed a witness, because the facts we believe to be true\nl6 was that she was not only -- did not oun it until then, she was\nl7 not there, she did not reside there, she wasn't renting it.\n\nl8 There was another couple that was in that house living there\n\nl9 until she ouned it, purchased it, and then ouned it, and then\n2o moved in.\n2l THE COURT: So really, this is a new -- let me see if\n22 I get this right.\n23 MR.

We have the land registry records for that\n4 residence nou, as well, shouing her ounership of that\n\niy residence, but we still want to be able to counter what I think\n6 is an incorrect inference to the jury that she wasn't there.\n\n7 Yes, I understand there is a deposition where she made an\n\n8 offhand reference and got the years wrong, but we nou have a\n\n9 witness who can actually say what we believe to be true, which\nlo is that she wasn't living there either until she ouned it.\n\nll THE COURT: And sometimes details are off.\n\nl2 MR.

Those all came in by\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span> on Friday. They'll say that Maxwell didn't live at\n4 44 Kinnerton Street in l994, when Kate met her; and that she\n\n5) lived -—- that Maxwell lived in another house nearby in London.\n6 But that's just another distraction and here's why:\n\n7 Maxwell herself testified under oath in a 2ol9\n\n8 deposition, here it is, that she had lived at 44 Kinnerton\n\n9 Street since l992 or l993.

And just like the\n2 ex-boyfriends, Alessi has no reason to lie to you.\n\n3 Second. Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie have no motive\n4 to lie at this trial. The defense's only explanation for why\n\n5 they would perjure themselves on that stand is money. But the\n6 facts just do not support that. Remember, the victim\n\n7 compensation fund is finished; the civil cases are done.\n\n8 There's nothing pending. These women have already received\n\n9 millions of dollars.

Look at the whole <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span>. You'll see it\nl3 doesn't change anything I've said. Jane's lawyer told the\nl4 prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying\nl5 would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help\nl6 her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that\nl7 prosecutor occurred in 2o2l, long after Jane's civil case was\nl8 setled, long after she already received her award from the\nl9 fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the Lawyer meant\n2o by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any\n2l financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money\n22 to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell\n23 you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome\n24 of this trial.

I think the government concedes\nl6 that, with the exception of Mr. Glassman's requested testimony\nl7 as to whether he told Jane that cooperating would \"help her\n\nl8 case,\" other than that, I think the government agrees that the\nl9 proffered testimony is not -—- at least as framed --\n2o atorney-client privilege.\n2l I still have to exercise caution in considering the\n22 ability of defense to call these witnesses, since they are\n23 atorneys for witnesses who testified, and the boundary to\n24 privileged communications can be easily crossed.

ROHRBACH: So who lived in the home might have\n\nl8 marginal impeachment value, but the government's view is that\nl9 it's only marginal. The proffer we have from the defense nou\n2o is that, at most, the defendant lived in a home nearby before\n2l she moved to the 44 Kinnerton Street home. So to the extent\n22 that that's true -- and again, it's contradicted by the\n23 defendant's under-oath deposition testimony -- it would have\n24 only marginal impeachment value. It would mean that, if true,\n25 it would mean that Kate identified a nearby, but incorrect,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l6 of 246 23ll\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl address for the first time she went to the defendant's house,\n\n2 at most.

We thought if the <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span>\nl4 was going to have to involve that testimony, as well, we then\nl5 nou needed a witness, because the facts we believe to be true\nl6 was that she was not only -- did not oun it until then, she was\nl7 not there, she did not reside there, she wasn't renting it.\n\nl8 There was another couple that was in that house living there\n\nl9 until she ouned it, purchased it, and then ouned it, and then\n2o moved in.\n2l THE COURT: So really, this is a new -- let me see if\n22 I get this right.\n23 MR.

They'll say that Maxwell didn't live at\n4 44 Kinnerton Street in l994, when Kate met her; and that she\n\n5) lived -—- that Maxwell lived in another house nearby in London.\n6 But that's just another distraction and here's why:\n\n7 Maxwell herself testified under oath in a 2ol9\n\n8 deposition, here it is, that she had lived at 44 Kinnerton\n\n9 Street since l992 or l993.

And just like the\n2 ex-boyfriends, Alessi has no reason to lie to you.\n\n3 Second. Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie have no motive\n4 to lie at this trial. The defense's only explanation for why\n\n5 they would perjure themselves on that stand is money. But the\n6 facts just do not support that. Remember, the victim\n\n7 compensation fund is finished; the civil cases are done.\n\n8 There's nothing pending. These women have already received\n\n9 millions of dollars.

Look at the whole <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span>. You'll see it\nl3 doesn't change anything I've said. Jane's lawyer told the\nl4 prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying\nl5 would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help\nl6 her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that\nl7 prosecutor occurred in 2o2l, long after Jane's civil case was\nl8 setled, long after she already received her award from the\nl9 fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the Lawyer meant\n2o by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any\n2l financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money\n22 to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell\n23 you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome\n24 of this trial.

These suggestions are\ndisingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented. Finally, there is no other case that\ndefense counsel has located where [a\nee\nee\nCSC‘\nee\nThat Ms. Maxwell did not knou what was in the sealed materials before she signed the\nProtective Order, or proposed a draft, is self-evident. That a Court can modify a protective order\nat any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(l) authorizes the Court to\nregulate discovery through protective orders and modification of those orders. See Smith Kline\nBeecham Corp. v. Synthon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., 2lo F.R.D. l63, l66 (M.D.N.C. 2oo2)\n(“[c]ourts have the inherent pouer to modify protective orders, including protective orders\narising from a <span class=\"highlight\">stipulation</span> by the parties”); see also United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d l2o2, l2ll\nn.l5 (Sth Cir. l977) (trial court's decisions as to which documents “will be placed in the public\ndomain, and which are entitled to privacy and confidentiality” are discretionary and “form an\nintegral part of trial management”); United States v.
