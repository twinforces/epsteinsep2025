Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Pitman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in advance of the bail hearing <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nfor July 8, 2ol9, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should\norder that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\n\nAs set forth belou, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is\nalleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years,\nand he nou faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted\nevidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the substantial\nincarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of\nflight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ounership of and access to private\nplanes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of\nthe defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned\nfrom a multi-week stay abroad.\n\nFinally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past\nexperience with this defendant—that if alloued to remain out on bail, the defendant could atempt\nto pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and\ntheir families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger\nto the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight.\nThe defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this\ncase, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000353.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentili-2 Filed o7/l2/l9 Pagelof2\nDate: @:, BEACH POLICE —— Page: | |\nTime: Incident Report Program: Pe\nCase No. ... : iy (Continued)\n\"Entered By.: iy LL\nOn 7 I received several phone calls throughout the day\nfrom who stated he had been folloued aggressively by a private\ninvestigator.

This Court should reach\nthe same conclusion based on the extraordinary risk of flight described in detail above.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that bail is required for her to prepare her defense is equally\nunpersuasive.

See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/BOP (reported l2/7/2o). While Ms. Maxwell is\nisolated from general population inmates, the crew of security guards who monitor her 24/7 are\nnot subject to mandatory testing, with some guards assigned to her detail rotating in from BOP\nfacilities where inmates and staff have tested positive. And while Ms. Maxwell may not be\nexposed to other inmates, she is exposed to individuals while escorted to a common area for\nbody scanning, further risking her exposure to COVID.\n\nWhile reciting BOP policy, the leter fails to address:\n\n= why as an isolated inmate, Ms. Maxwell is subject to repeated searching;\n\n=» why Ms. Maxwell is under 24/7 surveillance by a cadre of officers who are\nrequired to report her status every l5 minutes;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell is constantly surveilled by a hand-held camera, even during\natorney-client conferences;\n\n= why all of Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails were erased from the CorrLinks system;\n\n=\" why immediately after receiving two nasal swab COVID tests, Ms. Maxwell was\nrequired to remove her mask for an in-mouth inspection, heightening her exposure\nto COVID as she was placed in quarantine;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell’s legal papers are repeatedly inspected.\n\nWarden Tellez has failed to respond to our assertion that the MDC has imposed\nextraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint on Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic\nconsequences of negligence occurring at the MCC that resulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Atorney General of the United States has said as much. Beyond the decision to not place\nMs. Maxwell in general population, to which we have no objection, the leter virtually concedes\nthat other restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are not in response to any concern specific to her\nand tacitly suggests the heightened restrictions are in response to the high-profile nature of the\ncase and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to keep Epstein — an actual threat to himself —\nalive. As ABC News reported:\n\nAtorney General William Barr told ABC News on Wednesday that he is keeping a close\n\nwatch to make sure that Maxwell makes it to trial after Epstein died by suicide in a\n\nManhatan jail while awaiting trial last year.

STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. <span class=\"highlight\">Scheduled</span> calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\n<span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001895.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page l8 of 9l l8\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl courts details about the process we used for notification for\n\n2 this conference and also what we anticipate to use going\n\n3 forward.\n\n4 So to begin with, the government notified relevant\n\na victims or their counsel immediately follouing the arrest of\n\n6 the defendant on July 2 about the fact of the arrest and the\n\n7 initial presentment <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for later that day.\n\n8 In advance of the initial presentment, those victims\n\n9 were provided the opportunity to participate through the\n\nlo court's protocol for appearances in New Hampshire.\n\nll On July 7, the court set a date for arraignment and\n\nl2 bail hearing on July l4, today, and by the follouing day from\nl3 the court's order, the government had notified relevant victims\nl4 or their counsel of that scheduling order and advised victims\nl5 and counsel of their right to be heard in connection with the\nl6 bail hearing.\n\nl7 On that same day, the government posted to its victim\nl8 services website, including a link to the indictment, as well\nl9 as scheduling information relating to the hearing.\n2o On July 9, the government updated the website to\n2l include the dial-in information that the court provided.\n22 In addition, on July 8, the government sent leter\n23 notifications to individuals who have identified themselves as\n24 victims of Ghislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein that were not\n25 specifically referenced in the indictment.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool895\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 89 of 9l 89\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl court is greatly concern by the Bureau of Prisons' ability to\n\n2 keep inmates and detainees safe during the health crisis and\n\n3 has found those considerations to be significant in other\n\n4 cases.

We have conferred with the government, which has consented to the requested\nextension and the modified briefing schedule. The requested extension is necessary given the\nlarge volume of discovery produced by the government, which we are still reviewing, and to\nensure that defense counsel can adequately discuss the motions with our client and have her\nreview them. As the Court is aware, Ms. Maxwell was recently placed in quarantine for l4 days\nand in-person legal visits at MDC have been indefinitely suspended due to COVID, which has\nconstrained our ability to confer with her.\nUnder the Court’s original briefing schedule, the defendant’s pretrial motions were due on\nDecember 2l, 2o2o, the government’s response was due January 22, 2o2l, and the defendant’s\nreply was due on February 5, 2o2l. (Dkt. 25). The Court agreed to move those deadlines by three\nweeks because the government needed additional time to finish producing discovery. (Dkt. 72).\nUnder the current briefing schedule, the defendant’s pretrial motions are due on January ll, 2o2o,\nthe government’s response is due February l2, 2o2l, and the defendant’s reply is due on February\nl9, 2o2l.

See id. Because Schulte’s grand jury venire was\ndrawn from White Plains, Bahna instructs the Court to “look to that division” as the relevant |\ncommunity in assessing his fair cross-section challenge.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government writes to notify the Court that today, a Grand Jury siting in Manhatan\nreturned a superseding indictment in the above-captioned case (the “S2 Indictment”).! The\nGovernment respectfully submits this leter (l) to identify the differences between the charges\ncontained in the S2 Indictment and the charges contained in the prior indictment, Sl 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJIN) (the “Sl Indictment’); (2) to address the impact, if any, of the S2 Indictment on the status\nof discovery and other disclosures; and (3) to address the impact of the S2 Indictment on the\ncurrently pending motions.\n\n' The Government noted in its February 26, 2o2l Omnibus Memorandum of Law in Opposition\nto the Defendant’s Pretrial Motions that its investigation remained ongoing and that the\nGovernment would seek a superseding indictment no later than three months prior to trial. At this\njuncture, while the Government’s investigation is still ongoing, if trial remains set for July l2,\n2o2l as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, then the Government does not intend to seek any further indictments in this\ncase. To the extent the Government uncovers additional evidence that it may seek to introduce at\ntrial, it will promptly disclose such evidence to the defense as either Rule l6 or Jencks Act material.\nAdditionally, the Government remains cognizant that its Brady obligations remain ongoing and\nwill promptly disclose any exculpatory evidence of which it becomes aware.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl88 _ Filed o3/29/2l Page4of5\nPage 4\ntoday the Government provided the defense with a list of Bates ranges within the discovery\nmaterials produced to date that are particularly relevant to Minor Victim-4. Although that list is\nnot exhaustive and does not include every document that may be relevant to Minor Victim-4, it\nidentifies key pieces of evidence regarding this victim.\n\nAdditionally, in order to ensure that the defense has adequate time to prepare for trial, the\nGovernment intends to begin its production to the defense of non-testifying witness statements by\nApril l2, 2o2l, approximately three months in advance of trial. This production will include the\nstatements of more than 25o witnesses related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and his\nassociates in the Government’s possession whom the Government does not currently expect to call\nto testify at trial. The Government is continuing to review its files for witness statements and will\nproduce any additional non-testifying witness statements that come to light on a rolling basis as\npromptly as possible in advance of trial.\n\nFinally, given the expanded charges in the S2 Indictment, the Government is prepared to\nproduce Jencks Act and Giglio material for witnesses it expects to call at trial six weeks, rather\nthan four weeks, in advance of trial. These productions, together with the guidance provided to\nthe defense today regarding discovery relating to Minor Victim-4, should provide ample time for\nthe defense to prepare for trial and proceed as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nII.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nMarch 3l, 2o2l (Dkt. No. l92), and pursuant to the Court’s Order dated April 2, 2o2l (Dkt. No.\nl93). As set forth belou, the timing of superseding indictment S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) (the “S2\nIndictment”) was dictated by developments in the Government’s ongoing investigation, not the\nnefarious motivations suggested by the defense. Although trial may be modestly longer as a result,\nthe S2 Indictment by no means opens the floodgate of witnesses the defense imagines; to the\ncontrary, the Government expects to present a streamlined case focusing primarily on the four\nminor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment. Moreover, the Government has already taken, and\nwill continue to take, steps to ensure that the defense will be fully prepared for trial as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nin July. Accordingly, the Government would oppose any request for an adjournment of trial.\nFinally, the addition of new charges, supported by even more evidence, in no way warrants\nreconsideration of this Court’s three prior orders denying the defendant bail.\n\nFirst, the Government obtained the S2 Indictment based on new evidence that was not\navailable to it at the time the defendant was indicted in 2o2o or at the time Jeffrey Epstein was\nindicted in 2ol9. Specifically, although Minor Victim-4 had previously been interviewed once in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\ndefense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l. As noted in its March 29, 2o2l\nleter to the Court, the Government has already produced to the defense all material of which it is\naware that constitutes Rule l6 discovery related to the new allegations in the S2 Indictment. This\nincludes material that was already in the files of the FBI, which the Government produced during\nits Fall 2o2o productions, and new material obtained during the Government’s investigation, which\nthe Government has produced on a rolling basis as it has received such material. Additionally, the\nGovernment provided the defendant with a list of Bates ranges within the past discovery\nproductions that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4, which should substantially assist the\ndefense in re-reviewing relevant materials and preparing for trial. In other words, this is not a\nsuperseding indictment that requires a huge production of new discovery that the defense will need\ntime to review. To the contrary, the defense already had in its possession Rule l6 discovery\nrelevant to the S2 Indictment for months.\n\nThe Government plans to begin producing non-testifying witness statements on April l2,\n2o2l. With these productions, the defense will have access to statements of witnesses whom the\nGovernment does not intend to call at trial, thereby providing the defense multiple months during\nwhich it can decide whether it wishes to call any of these individuals. Further, the Government\nplans to produce Jencks Act and Giglio material for testifying witnesses six weeks in advance of\ntrial, which will provide the defense with far more time than is typical in this District for review\nof such material. Given that the defense has had discovery in this case for months, will have\nmonths with non-testifying witness statements, and will have more than one month with Jencks\nAct and Giglio material, there is every reason to believe that the defense will provide excellent\nrepresentation to the defendant at trial as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> beginning July l2, 2o2l.\n\nIn light of the ample time that remains before trial and the steps the Government has\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page6eof8\nPage 6\n\ncommited to taking to aid the defense in preparing for trial, the Government anticipates objecting\nto any request to adjourn trial, should one be made. The Government contacted defense counsel\non March 29, 2o2l to convey its availability for a call to discuss some of the issues above as well\nas a supplemental briefing schedule for certain of the defendant’s pending motions, among other\nissues. Although such a call has not yet taken place, the Government remains available to confer\nwith the defense regarding these issues, as well as a schedule for trial-related filings such as\nmotions in limine and requests to charge. Indeed, the Government and defense counsel have\nconferred extensively by email over the last several days regarding defense requests to review\ncertain physical evidence and other defense inquiries regarding discovery in this case. As a result\nof this conferral, the Government has <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> an evidence review session for the defendant and\ndefense counsel to review physical evidence in the custody of the FBI relating to this case in the\ncoming days. The Government will continue to be available to confer with defense counsel and is\nprepared to discuss scheduling maters whenever the defense would like.\n\nFinally, nothing about the S2 Indictment supports reconsideration of this Court’s three\nprior decisions ordering the defendant detained pending trial. If anything, the arguments in favor\nof detention are nou stronger. The defendant nou faces two additional charges, which increase\nthe maximum penalty she faces to eighty years in prison. She also faces even more evidence,\nincluding a fourth victim, who is corroborated by independent evidence, including other witnesses\nand documents such as travel records, phone records, shipment records, and items recovered\nduring the execution of a search warrant. Moreover, as the defense seems to implicitly recognize,\nthe S2 Indictment undermines certain legal arguments the defense previously made in atacking\nthe prior indictment in this case. (See Dkt. No. l92 at 2 (“The timing suggests that the decision to\nsupersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial motions and government concern about\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo29l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page7of8\nPage 7\n\nthe nou-apparent weakness of its case.”’”)). Taken together, these factors all point to the conclusion\nthat the defendant nou faces an even stronger case with even more severe consequences upon\nconviction. The S2 Indictment thus further increases the defendant’s incentives to flee, and it does\nnothing to alter the other factors that the Court previously found weigh in favor of detention,\nincluding the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, skill at evading detection, and prior lack of candor\nwith the Court.\n\nThe Government has no objection to an in-person arraignment, but the Government objects\nto the defense request for yet another bail hearing. The defense has nou had three bites at that\nparticular apple and is currently appealing the issues raised therein to the Second Circuit, where\nargument is <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to take place on April 26, 2o2l. The introduction of additional charges,\nreflecting additional evidence, in no way supports a fourth argument for release, and the Court\nshould not entertain yet another application under these circumstances, especially when this very\nissue is currently before the Circuit. Certainly, the fact that a grand jury has found probable cause\nto believe that the defendant has commited even more crimes does not somehou suggest that the\nGovernment’s case is in any way weaker than it was at the time of the prior three bail applications.\nTo the contrary, the detailed allegations in the S2 Indictment make clear that there is nou more\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nNor does anything about the S2 Indictment support the defense request that the Court take\nthe extraordinary step of holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue of bail. “It is well established\nin this circuit that proffers are permissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation\ncontexts.” United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are\ntypically informal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery. Often the opposing parties\nsimply describe to the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page8sof8\nPage 8\nit.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, in this Circuit, District Courts regularly\naccept the Government’s proffer regarding its evidence when considering a bail application. And\nhere, of course, the Court has not only the Government’s proffer but also the grand jury’s\ndetermination that probable cause exists as to each of the charged offenses. Defense counsel’s\nrequest to deviate from that ordinary practice appears to be a thinly veiled atempt at a fishing\nexpedition through which the defense hopes to obtain early Jencks Act material and a pretrial\nopportunity to cross-examine the Government’s witnesses, including victims of sexual abuse. It\nis to avoid such a fishing expedition, among other reasons, that courts in this Circuit proceed by\nproffer when considering bail motions. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir.\nl986) (“a detention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial . . . or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant”).

The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003225.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 49 of 348\n‘anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process. Lewis asked to meet with Villafafia\nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafafia declined.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him\nthat she also represented Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2ooo to September\n2oo5 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was\nthe Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when\nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafafia led the defense team\nto believe that the mater had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of\nthat notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible”\nin working with the USAO. Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO\non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a leter to Villafafia on November l5, 2oo6, in which she asserted\nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact\nor communications about Epstein to them. In response, Villafafia requested that the defense\nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents\nand information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Atorney’s Office, and\n“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”\nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2oo5. In\nJanuary 2oo7, Sanchez contacted Villafafia to schedule a meeting, but Villafafia responded that\nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.\n\nImmediately after receiving Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafafia and phoned\nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. Lourie agreed\nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned\nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and\npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that\nwould be a possibility.” Villafafia told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents\nshe had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,\nhouever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for\nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is pouer.” Lourie further\nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO\nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged. Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home. The meeting was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nfor February l, 2oo7, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the\nUSAO by January 25, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,\ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafafia alerted him that she had spoken again with\nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents. As Villafafia\ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about hou the girls are liars and drug users.”\nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what\nthe defense would say, and she could not see hou a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.\nShe explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently”\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerms about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 348\njurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was ‘“‘a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 348\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!°7\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach.

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”'“” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call. Fisher told OPR that she had no recollection of this call, and Lourie also could\nl? The NPA had required Epstein’s plea and sentencing to occur by October 26, 2oo7, but provided that Epstein\ncould report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2oo8.\n\nl5o State v. Epstein, No. 2oo6-CF-9454, Notice of Hearing (Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Dec. 7, 2oo7).\nll Ina meeting with Acosta and Sloman on November 2l, 2oo7, Lefkouitz informed them that Starr had placed\na call to Fisher.\n94\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3296\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!®°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3l of 348\nwhether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'% Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkouitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays”\nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS\ntime to engage in a thorough review.”\n\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 348\npreparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up\nalready.””*° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the\nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging recommendation supported his statements to OPR\nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored\ninto the government’s charging strategy.\n\nThe two February 2oo7 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and\nclaims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2oo7, defense atorneys requested\nanother meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a\npresentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution. The request was\ngranted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to\nus... to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.” The requested meeting\ntook place on June 26, 2oo7. Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to\nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense\ncounsel used that information to prepare a l9-page leter, submited to the USAO the day before\nthe June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In an email to his colleagues,\nLourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments. A\ncontemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafafia viewed the meeting itself as\nprimarily a “listening session.””*! After the meeting, Epstein’s team submited a second lengthy\nleter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state\nhandle the mater.\n\nMenchel apparently <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 3l, 2oo7, to\nfacilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed\nterms of a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nBy early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys—Starr and Lefkouitz—joined the\ndefense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds . . . that I\nhave not met with them.” A meeting with the defense team was eventually <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for\nSeptember 7, 2oo7, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, and Oosterban met with Starr, Lefkouitz,\nand Sanchez. In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense,\nwith Oosterban participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.” In another email to Sloman\nand Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhou, if we don’t meet\nwith them. I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline\nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”\nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already\ndecided hou he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our\nposition.”\n\n23o Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have\nnothing on at all.”\n\n23l During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the\ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break\nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense. She did\nnot recall specifics of the discussion, houever.\n\nl58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo336o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter.

Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8.

In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n453 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n334 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n2o8 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

Once the hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.*! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003572.jpg": "Case TAGeveosseeHAtP DmmuneitPerirs Rise PaeyeS ictebt\nPage 92\nl G Maxwell - Confidential\n2 Q.

The\nGovernment filed an S2 Superseding Indictment on March 29, 2o2l. Dkt. No. l87. The new\nindictment alleges that the conspiracies charged in Counts l and 3 extended to 2oo4 (the Sl\ncharged through l997) and identifies a fourth alleged victim, Minor Victim-4. It also adds two\nnew charges: Count 5 of the S2 Indictment charges Maxwell with participating in a sex\ntrafficking conspiracy between 2ool and 2oo4, and Count 6 charges Maxwell with participating\nin the sex trafficking of a minor or aiding and abeting the same. Jd.\n\nSince the filing of the S2 indictment, the parties have argued in leters whether its\nadditional charges and extended timeframe necessitates an adjournment of the trial date. Dkt.\n\nNos. l92, l99, and 2o2. Maxwell has also indicated that she either is requesting or will request a\n\nrenewed bail hearing in light of the filing of the S2.

No. 2o2. The leter first argues that a 9o-day adjournment is necessary.\n\nBut it also states that some of her defense counsel are not available between September and\n\nDecember 2o2l, implying that the request is in fact to adjourn until January 2o22.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s Order dated\nApril 2o, 2o2l, which permited the Government an opportunity to submit a response to the\ndefense request for an adjournment of trial in the above-referenced case. (Dkt. No. 22l). As\npreviewed in its April 9, 2o2l leter (Dkt. No. l99), the Government strenuously opposes any\nadjournment of the July l2, 2o2l trial date in this case. Given both the recently granted severance\nand the Government’s intention to present a streamlined case focused primarily on the experiences\nof four victims, trial on the non-perjury counts in indictment S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) (the “S2\nIndictment”) will not be materially lengthened by the addition of new charges. As previously\nnoted, the Government has made and will continue to make significant efforts to ensure that the\ndefense is able to prepare for trial as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>. Moreover, delay of the trial would prejudice the\nvictims in this case, multiple of whom oppose any adjournment. Should the Court nevertheless\ngrant the defense’s request for an adjournment, houever, the Government respectfully requests\nthat trial be <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for March 2o22 to ensure continuity of Government counsel at trial.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3943\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 _ Filed o4/22/2l Page5oflo\nPage 5\n\nSecond, the Government will continue to take steps to ensure that the defense is able to\nprepare for trial as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>. As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, the Government has already\nincluded Rule l6 discovery relating to the S2 Indictment in its prior productions to the defense,\nand the Government has provided the defense with a list of pages within those discovery\nproductions that are particularly pertinent to the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment.”\nContrary to the defense’s suggestion in its most recent leter, the largest discovery production in\nthis case came from electronic devices seized from Jeffrey Epstein. That production, dated\nNovember l8, 2o2o, included approximately l.2 million documents (totaling approximately 2.2\nmillion pages), all of which are text searchable and were produced in a format conducive to loading\nthat production into a document review platform.? Moreover, the defense’s suggestion that it will\nneed to re-review every single page of discovery produced to date is, at best, hyperbolic. The\ndefense has already reviewed the discovery and presumably knous which portions relate in\n> To the extent the defense complains of recent difficulties reviewing certain Highly Confidential\nimages or other items that must be reviewed in the presence of federal agents, it bears noting that\nthe Government repeatedly informed defense counsel beginning in the fall of 2o2o that those\nmaterials would be made available for review upon request. The defense did not request to review\nthose materials until March 2o2l, after which the Government coordinated with defense counsel,\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals to arrange for multiple days in April\n2o2l during which all of the materials were made available for review. The Government is of\ncourse willing to make similar arrangements should defense counsel believe additional review of\nthose materials is necessary.\n3 Only yesterday did defense counsel provide the Government with a list of documents that the\ndefendant has been unable to review from the prior discovery productions. As it has done in the\npast when such issues have been raised, the Government will work with its staff and staff at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to address these issues as expeditiously as possible. The\nGovernment notes, houever, that had defense counsel raised these specific issues earlier, the\nGovernment could have addressed them much sooner.\nSimilarly, the defense only raised concerns about metadata on certain photographs this month,\neven though those photographs were produced to the defense in November 2o2o. The Government\nis working with its staff and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into and, where possible,\naddress the defense’s concerns as quickly as possible.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page6oflo\nPage 6\n\nparticular to the time period covered by the S2 Indictment, especially with the guidance provided\nby the Government regarding key documents relevant to Minor Victim-4. Given that the largest\nportion of the discovery in this case is text searchable, the defense will also be able to tailor any\nre-review of those materials through relevant search terms. The combination of having already\npossessed the relevant discovery for months and receiving a list of key documents should\nmeaningfully assist the defense in preparing for trial as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>.\n\nThe Government has also commited to providing further disclosures well in advance of\ntrial and far earlier than such productions would ordinarily be made in this District. The\nGovernment has already begun producing materials relating to witnesses whom it does not intend\nto call at trial to the defense, more than three months in advance of trial. The bulk of those\nmaterials were produced on April l3, 2o2l, and the Government intends to make additional\nproductions on a rolling basis as it continues to review its files for such materials. In this vein, the\nGovernment has produced materials, including prior witness statements, for approximately 225\nindividuals relevant to the Government’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, and\nothers. While the Government made this production with an expansive eye touard its pretrial\ndisclosures, as it has adopted throughout the pendency of this mater, it bears noting that a\nsignificant majority of those individuals never mentioned or knew the defendant. Indeed, the\nnumber of non-testifying witnesses who mentioned the defendant makes up a small portion of the\noverall production. That is unsurprising, given that the Government conducted a broad\ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, including crimes that did not involve this defendant.\nAccordingly, to the extent the defense claims it nou needs to investigate or interview all, or even\nthe majority of these witnesses, it is unclear hou that testimony would be relevant or admissible\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3948\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\n\nthis case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,\nyet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury questionnaire to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys. Throughout the pendency of this case, the\ndefense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping\nschedules while also carefully reviewing discovery and preparing for trial. In addition, the\ndefendant has the benefit of even more atorneys who have appeared on her behalf to brief and\nargue appeals in this case before the Second Circuit, as well as staff such as paralegals and\ninvestigators assisting her atorneys. Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is\nevery reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional\nrepresentation at trial as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>.\n\nThird, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The\nlonger this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial\ntestimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a resolution. As a result, multiple victims oppose any\nadjournment of the trial date. In particular, Minor Victim-3 expressed feeling significant stress\nduring the pendency of this case and a strong desire to have the case brought to a close through\ntrial as soon as possible. Similarly, Minor Victim-2 also indicated that she has experienced an\nenormous amount of stress while this case has been pending, wishes to see the case brought to trial\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page lo of lo\nPage lo\nas <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, and has already planned to be available to testify at trial as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> this summer,\ndespite her personal and professional obligations. These views further weigh against an\nadjournment of the July l2, 2o2l trial date.\n\nFinally, although the Government maintains that an adjournment is not warranted here, if\nthe Court nevertheless adjourns trial, the Government respectfully requests that the new trial date\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for March 2o22. Were the trial to be <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for any date between September\n2o2l and February 2o22, one or more of the undersigned prosecutors, including prosecutors who\nhave been on this case for multiple years, would be unable to participate in the trial given pre-\nexisting trial commitments,’ among other reasons.

Particularized facts supporting a continuance.\n\nA. Conflicting Trial Schedules\n\nThe government originally estimated that a trial of the $l indictment would last two\nweeks. Ms. Maxwell reluctantly agreed to set the trial out for a full year — despite the Court’s\norder of detention -- to ensure that she and her counsel would have sufficient time to analyze the\ngovernment’s case and prepare for a defense. The case was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to begin July l2, 2o2l\nand continue for two weeks.\n\nFollouing the return of the S2 indictment, the government nou estimates that “its case-\nin-chief will take up to three weeks,” and thus “propose[s] reserving four weeks for trial in this\nmater.” Dkt. l99 at 4. The government did not, apparently, take into account (a) the amount of\ntime that will be required to empanel a jury in this high-publicity case, nor (b) account for the\ndefense to have ample time to put on its oun case. Simply put, defense counsel believe that a\nthree-week government case means a total trial length of 5-6 weeks, allouing Ms. Maxwell\n' Both Bobbi C. Sternheim, Esq. and AUSA Lara Pomerantz are counsel in |, a three-\ndefendant case. The government estimates the trial will last 8 weeks. The defense believes it may\ntake longer because all defendants and many witnesses do not speak English. Like the present\ncase, the J case is subject to COVID protocols which could affect the trial date.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page3ofl3\nThe Hon.

On\nMarch 29, 2o2l, three and a half months before trial, the Government filed an S2 Superseding\nIndictment. As a result of the late filing of the S2, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nrequest a continuance of the trial date until either fall 2o2l or January 2o22.' The Government\nopposes any continuance, but requests that if one is granted it be until March of 2o22. Having\ncarefully considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court GRANTS Maxwell’s request for\na short continuance until the fall of 2o2l to allou the defense to prepare for the additional\ncharges brought in the S2 indictment. The Court rejects Maxwell’s alternative request to\ncontinue the trial date until January of 2o22 and the Government’s alternative proposal that the\nCourt adjourn trial until March of 2o22.\nThe Court bases its decision on a number of factors. First, the filing of the S2 indictment\nhas added a significant burden to the defense’s preparation for trial. The new indictment alleges\n! The alternative request by Maxwell resulted from a conflict among lawyers involved in both this case and a\ncriminal mater before Judge Furman, which is discussed in defense counsel’s leter. Dkt. No. 246 at 4. The Court\nhas been informed that Judge Furman has adjourned the trial date with respect to two defendants. The Court\npresumes that this eliminates the September through December conflict for one of Maxwell’s defense counsel.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s Order dated\nMay 3, 2o2l, which directed the parties to meet and confer and jointly propose a trial start date.\n(Dkt. No. 266). The parties have met and conferred in accordance with the Order. Although both\nparties seek a trial date in November, the parties have not reached agreement on the particular start\ndate in that month.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests that the trial start on November 29, 2o2l. The\nGovernment understands that the earliest defense counsel can begin the trial is November 8, 2o2l\nand that is defense counsel’s preferred trial start date. Defense counsel has indicated that it would\nconsider starting on November l5, 2o2l as an accommodation to the Government, but no later.\nDefense counsel has informed the Government that they are available through the end of 2o2l.!\n\n' Defense counsel has informed the Government that one of the defendant’s atorneys has a civil\ntrial <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for December l3, 2o2l, but indicated that the atorney will request that the trial\ndate be moved.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 275 _ Filed o5/lo/2l Page2of5\nPage 2\n\nThe Government respectfully requests that the new trial date be <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for November\n29, 2o2l, which is only three weeks after the date requested by defense counsel and more than a\nmonth earlier than the January 2o22 date previously requested by defense counsel. AUSA\nPomerantz intends to make arrangements so that she will be available to begin trial on that date.\nAUSA Comey also intends to make arrangements such that she will be able to participate in the\ntrial if it begins on November 29, 2o2l or later; houever, she is unable to participate in a trial that\nbegins before November 29, 2o2l. The Government has also contacted several of the witnesses it\nintends to call at trial and understands that they are available to begin on the Government’s\nproposed date of November 29, 2o2l. The Government notes that one of the minor victims\nidentified in the S2 Indictment is also available to testify at trial if it is <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to begin on\nNovember 29, 2o2l or later, but would likely be unavailable to testify between October l, 2o2l\nand Thanksgiving.”\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that a trial date of November 29, 2o2l is in the\ninterests of justice because it would permit all of the undersigned prosecutors to participate in the\ntrial, thereby ensuring continuity of counsel. In particular, AUSA Comey has been assigned to\nthis investigation for multiple years and has taken the lead on discovery and the review of\ninvestigative files created and maintained by other offices and agencies (see Dkt. No. 63, l9o). In\nlight of the Court’s opinion in United States v. Nejad, 487 F. Supp. 3d 2o6, 2l3-l4 (S.D.N.Y.\n2o2o), noting concerns regarding the continuity of Government counsel particularly with respect\nto discovery and disclosure issues, the Government respectfully submits that is in the interests of\n* Based on the nature of the witness’s conflict, to the extent the Court schedules trial for the\nbeginning of November, the Government expects that the witness would still be able to testify, but\nwould need to do so at the end of the case, out of order.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document275 Filed o5/lo/2l Page4of5\nPage 4\nwould provide the defense with the identities of the victims eight weeks before trial, on May l7,\n2o2l, assuming trial were to begin as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> on July l2, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. 229, 25o). If the\nCourt were to schedule trial to begin on November 29, 2o2l, in order to address the three-week\nadjournment that the Government is seeking, the Government would intend to provide the defense\nwith the identities of the victims referenced in the S2 Indictment eleven weeks before trial. The\nGovernment understands that the defense objects to the Government’s proposal and requests that\nthe information be provided on May l7, 2o2l, which would be approximately six months in\nadvance of trial.\n\nFinally, the Government respectfully requests that the Court exclude time under the Speedy\nTrial Act through the date on which trial will proceed on Counts One through Six of Indictment\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN). The exclusion of time is warranted for multiple reasons, including: to permit\nthe defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding\nindictment, including materials related to non-testifying witnesses and the Government’s expert\nwitness; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures, including proposed exhibits, proposed witness lists, and\nwitness statements; and to allou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Accordingly,\nthe Government respectfully submits that the exclusion of time is in the interests of justice pursuant\nto l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7). The Government has consulted with defense counsel, who consents to\nthe exclusion of time, but only through November 8, 2o2l. In view of the defendant’s previous\nproposal ofa January 2o22 trial date, houever, the Government respectfully submits that exclusion\nof time through November 29, 2o2l is warranted here and consistent with the factors set forth in\nthe Speedy Trial Act. For the reasons noted above, the Government respectfully submits that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo4ll5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004208.jpg": "Casask 4olg-Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneeehes FitdeachemMens! pdgage cf afil2\n\nWeighing these factors, there is no basis for permiting more than the presumptive ten\ndeposition limit. First, as highlighted by the motion, the information purportedly sought is\ncumulative and duplicative. By way of example, Plaintiff has already deposed Johanna Sjoberg\n(a former Epstein employee), Juan Alessi (a former Epstein employee), and David Rodgers*\n(former Epstein Pilot). She further seeks to depose Maria Alessi and Jo Fontanella (former\nEpstein household employees), as well as Dana Bums and Emmy Taylor (identified as assistants\nto Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein). The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may\nhave is identical to that of each other — what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff\ngoes so far as to state that Maria Alessi’s deposition is expected to “corroborate” the\nobservations of her husband’s.\n\nPlaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is “obtaining\nwitnesses, like Ms. Sjoberg, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Yet, Ms.\nSjoberg did not “corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Instead, she testified that [jj\nees\n——————————— Ss\n———$<—— OOOO\nI\nRegardless, Plaintiff is looking in vain for more testimony of exactly the same character,\nprecisely the type of testimony the presumptive limit is intended to prevent.\n\nSimilarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe\nRecarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.\n\n* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the\n<span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs. There are far more convenient, less\nburdensome, and less expensive methods by which such information could have been obtained, such as a verifying\naffidavit, yet Plaintiff chose to unnecessarily burden counsel, the witness and counsel for the witness with a 3 hour\ndeposition to accomplish the same end.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page 2ofl3\nPage 2\ne The parties shall simultaneously file proposed jury questionnaires and proposed\nvoir dire 3 weeks in advance of jury selection, or by October 25, 2o2l.\ne The parties shall simultaneously file requests to charge and proposed verdict sheets\nby November 8, 2o2l, or 3 weeks in advance of trial.\n\nThe parties have been unable to reach agreement regarding the remaining pretrial dates.\nGovernment's Position\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court set the\nremaining schedule consistent with the Government’s proposals. In particular, the Government\nmakes the follouing proposals:\nIdentities of the Victims\n\nThe Government will provide the defense with the identities of the victims referenced in\nthe S2 Indictment by September l3, 2o2l, or ll weeks in advance of trial.

See, e.g., United States\nprohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.”); In re\nUnited States, 834 F.2d 283, 287 (2d Cir. l987).

The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5o of 349\n‘anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process. Lewis asked to meet with Villafafia\nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafafia declined.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him\nthat she also represented Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2ooo to September\n2oo5 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was\nthe Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when\nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafafia led the defense team\nto believe that the mater had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of\nthat notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible”\nin working with the USAO. Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO\non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a leter to Villafafia on November l5, 2oo6, in which she asserted\nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact\nor communications about Epstein to them. In response, Villafafia requested that the defense\nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents\nand information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Atorney’s Office, and\n“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”\nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2oo5. In\nJanuary 2oo7, Sanchez contacted Villafafia to schedule a meeting, but Villafafia responded that\nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.\n\nImmediately after receiving Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafafia and phoned\nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. Lourie agreed\nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned\nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and\npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that\nwould be a possibility.” Villafafia told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents\nshe had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,\nhouever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for\nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is pouer.” Lourie further\nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO\nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged. Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home. The meeting was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nfor February l, 2oo7, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the\nUSAO by January 25, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,\ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafafia alerted him that she had spoken again with\nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents. As Villafafia\ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about hou the girls are liars and drug users.”\nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what\nthe defense would say, and she could not see hou a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.\nShe explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently”\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 78 of 349\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 87 of 349\njurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll6 of 349\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach.

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”'“? Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call. Fisher told OPR that she had no recollection of this call, and Lourie also could\nl? The NPA had required Epstein’s plea and sentencing to occur by October 26, 2oo7, but provided that Epstein\ncould report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2oo8.\n\nl5o State v.

As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the ‘“‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l32 of 349\nwhether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'° Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkouitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays”\nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS\ntime to engage in a thorough review.”\n\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8l of 349\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.””°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “chung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l85 of 349\npreparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up\nalready.””°° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the\nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging recommendation supported his statements to OPR\nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored\ninto the government’s charging strategy.\n\nThe two February 2oo7 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and\nclaims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2oo7, defense atorneys requested\nanother meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a\npresentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution. The request was\ngranted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to\nus... to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.” The requested meeting\ntook place on June 26, 2oo7. Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to\nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense\ncounsel used that information to prepare a l9-page leter, submited to the USAO the day before\nthe June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In an email to his colleagues,\nLourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments. A\ncontemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafafia viewed the meeting itself as\nprimarily a “listening session.”**! After the meeting, Epstein’s team submited a second lengthy\nleter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state\nhandle the mater.\n\nMenchel apparently <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 3l, 2oo7, to\nfacilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed\nterms of a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nBy early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys—Starr and Lefkouitz—joined the\ndefense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds . . . that I\nhave not met with them.” A meeting with the defense team was eventually <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for\nSeptember 7, 2oo7, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, and Oosterban met with Starr, Lefkouitz,\nand Sanchez. In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense,\nwith Oosterban participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.” In another email to Sloman\nand Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhou, if we don’t meet\nwith them. I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline\nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”\nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already\ndecided hou he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our\nposition.”\n\n23o Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have\nnothing on at all.”\n\n23l During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the\ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break\nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 252 of 349\nin FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in.

JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”*>! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 259 of 349\n\nVillafafia told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims,\nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list. Villafafia recalled\nthat Reiter told her that he would “try to contact as many as he could” and that he would destroy\nthe list afterwards. Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\nidentified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\nvictims.”°>?\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”°\"4\nIn her 2oo8 declaration, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”**° In her 2oo8\ndeclaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n453 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n334 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n2o8 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

Once the hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ol of 349\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o3 of 349\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing.

Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004685.jpg": "—= ~ase-l2o.cr-oo33o-RA Decument293-2 jed-O5 Page 23 of 34\n: 24\n: l A | SRS schedule i iD :\n2 and sometimes | sR be out of toun ank be in\na Bew York and <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> her to come and work, put\n4 [iC primary role was te schedule or I\n5 quess she was tne one that wonld schedule L_ .\n6 |B) © 2 ceme and perfernm the massages -\nq Q bid ( ever actpwally isadc |\n8 upstairs up te the bedroom?\n24 G6loG by hergel se - Tae farst time that |\neH | sR at Mr. Epstein's by herself,\n7 l4 |kitchen and took her upstairs for the massage trat\nl5 |was to be performed for Mr. Epstein.\n/ l6 o Nou you mentioned the sexual activaty\nl? |that 9 2-2 ve netvecs\nl5 and Mr. Epstein.

Ms. Maxwell supported her position with leters from her\nspouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the\ncircumstances of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s explanation that she took\nthese measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to\nharm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to\nflee.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s\nwife atempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and purchased\nairline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half\nmonths after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court\nalloued the government to introduce this evidence to shou the defendant’s intent to flee and to\nargue that it was proof of consciousness of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and\nhighlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian\npassport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had\nknoun for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been\ndirectly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent\nwith an intention to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam), where the court found the\njury could properly infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country\none day after the crime was commited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 425 (citing Salameh, l52 F.3d at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagelloofl4\nl57). By contrast, the Second Circuit found that the government’s evidence in A/-Sadawi was\n“too atenuated” to establish that the defendant intended to flee to avoid prosecution or\napprehension and the government should not have been permited to argue consciousness of guilt\non the basis of that evidence. /d.\n\nHere, the purported “flight” evidence is even more atenuated than in Al-Sadawi. Like\nAl-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell knew she was a subject of the government’s investigation after the\narrest of Jeffery Epstein and could have left the country at any point in the one-year period\nleading up to her arrest (nine-and-a-half months longer than Al-Sadawi). But she did not.\n\nUnlike Al-Sadawi, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ms. Maxwell was preparing to flee.\nNeither Ms. Maxwell nor her spouse had purchased a plane ticket, nor was Ms. Maxwell\nplanning to move locations. On the contrary, Ms. Maxwell had been living in the same residence\nin New Hampshire for seven months — a location she chose because it was close to her family\nand close to the prosecutors in New York in case she needed to meet with them. Moreover,\nwhen Ms. Maxwell was arrested, the arresting agents found nothing suggesting that she planned\nto abscond. Finally, unlike A/-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell proffered independent evidence supporting\nan alternative explanation for her actions that rebuts any inference that she intended to flee.\n\nHence, if it was improper for the trial court to allou the introduction of flight evidence in\nAl-Sadawi, it would be even more improper for the Court to do so here.

That same day, the Government informed legal counsel at the MDC\nthat it had sent the hard drive.* According to the FedEx website, the Government understands that\nthe hard drive was received by the MDC on November l, 2o2l.

Legal\ncounsel at the MDC has explained to the Government that defense counsel’s request that the MDC\nbe directed to retrieve the mail within one business day of receipt by the post office is burdensome\nand is not practicable in light of the procedures outlined above, which apply to the l,7oo inmates\nat the MDC. The MDC mail staff will continue to follou its standard procedures and retrieve\nmail from the post office every moming of the business week.\n\nAs to the issues raised at the November l, 2o2l conference regarding the transportation of\nthe defendant to the Southern District of New York courthouse for proceedings in this mater,\naccording to legal counsel at the MDC, the procedures are similar to those used for other inmates,\nbut the timing varies slightly. To the extent the Court requires specific details on the timing of\ntransportation of the defendant as compared to other inmates, legal counsel at the MDC has\nexpressed security concerns about puting such details in a publicly filed leter. To extent the Court\nneeds that information, the Government would request permission to confer further with legal\ncounsel at the MDC and authorization from the Court to provide such information under seal. The\nGovernment understands from the United States Marshals Service that the clothing and lunches\nprovided to the defendant are provided by the Bureau of Prisons, and that the lunch does not usually\nrequire the use of utensils. This is the same for all defendants.\n\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\nthe Government will confer with legal counsel at the MDC and provide additional information.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o6 Filed ll/o2/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nFifth, should the Court limit or exclude Dr. Roccio’s opinions, rebutal opinions will\nmost likely be unnecessary.\n\nSixth, the testimony of two of the identified experts, Gerald LaPorte and Jennifer Naso,\nis anticipatory. These forensic document examiners have not yet seen the document that\nmay or may not be produced at trial. They were endorsed out of a spirit of non-\ngamesmanship and in an abundance of caution. Similarly, Robert Kelso will primarily be\ntestifying regarding exhibits that the government recently disclosed and, while likely not\neven an expert opinion, he too was disclosed in an abundance of caution.\n\nSeventh, the government’s proposed schedule is unworkable and will impact selection\nof the jury and the examination of witnesses. One reason to have Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nlitigated before jury selection is that the court may want to inquire of the prospective jurors\nabout “grooming” and, absent a decision, won’t knou if that term is going to be used at\ntrial. If Dr. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are disalloued, the issues regarding Rule 4l2\nwill likely be narroued.\n\nEighth, the defense needs to knou in advance of trial, including opening statements,\nwho is or is not testifying. It would be prejudicial to delay any challenge from the\ngovernment, which may or may not come, until after November 23, to be resolved per the\ngovernment, after opening statements. This is the epitome of gamesmanship because Ms.\nMaxwell will then not be alloued to discuss the testimony in opening.\n\nAnd, finally, the problem here was created by the government. Had the government\ndisclosed the 35oo materials sooner, an earlier expert disclosure date would have been\n<span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, resolving the government’s alleged compressed timing problem. It is the\ngovernment that has driven this schedule, not Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o8 Filed ll/o3/2l Page3of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

At that time, Atorney General William Barr said he initially had his oun suspicions\nabout Epstein’s death while detained at the MCC but came to conclude that Epstein’s death, an\napparent suicide, was the result of “a perfect storm of screw-ups.”!\n\nDuring an interview with ABC News, Barr stated he was “livid” when he learned that\nJeffrey Epstein had commited suicide and “happy that they had goten Ms. Maxwell.” ?

Nor was she provided any soap or any disinfectant to wash her hands, in\ndisregard of CDC pandemic protocols. When she caught a few minutes of sleep in the holding\ncell, a marshal jabbed her in the leg to get her atention.® She is already sleep deprived. Should\nshe be subjected to these conditions throughout the trial, it is highly likely that she will not have\nthe stamina to assist in her defense and endure the physical demands of a five-day per week,\nmulti-week court proceedings under the current onerous conditions of her detention.\n\nThe Court and the defense are nou in possession of Jencks Act and Giglio material\nregarding the four accusers which contradict the purported “strength” of the government’s case.\nContrary to the government’s claim — which the Court relied on to repeatedly deny Ms.\nMaxwell’s robust bail applications — there is no independent corroboration for the accusers’\nrespective allegations of abuse. Their respective statements do not corroborate one another and\nfurther demonstrate contamination and collusion from various sources. These disclosures\nsubstantially undermine the strength of the government’s case and underscore the fact that Ms.\nMaxwell should not be detained.\n\n° The male marshal assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail on Monday was inappropriately rough with and\nthreatening to her. After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of innocence and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service. I made a complaint to the U.S. Marshal and have requested that\nthis particular marshal not be assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail in the future.

Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4, Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s determination, the Administrator's receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant. Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service.

Given the substance of the juror’s dishonest\nanswer—that she had not been convicted of or arrested for any crimes when, in fact, she had\nbeen convicted of prostitution and arrested for larceny—her intent was relevant to whether she\nwas biased. An affirmative answer to the judge’s voir dire question did not, for that reason alone,\nrender the juror biased in a case involving controlled substances.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009183.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihtexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad she WAd A2predatdr ADpay Ma fOntihe\nSEMENT Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Pale Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex alfensier .\ning behavi d di ly imoli dj most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\nOreeming Denaviet ana WEE-NS!

For the reasons discussed belou, we\nbelieve that a non-incarcerative sentence would be a fair and parsimonious one. See United\nStates v.

The jury acquited Parse of the conspiracy count and three counts of tax evasion. Those\nconvictions stemmed from David Parse’s integral role in one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever\ncharged, the details of which are spelled out in the indictment against him, $3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP),\nand the trial record. Incorporating the factual allegations in the conspiracy count, Count Twenty\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel8 of 24\n\nThe government’s decision to add Counts Five and Six, which are based on the same\nconduct, did not suddenly convert Carolyn’s abuse and the conduct she described in the Palm\nBeach residence from 2ool-2oo4 into a separate, distinct conspiracy. In fact, the conduct in the\n2ooos that Carolyn described was no different than the conduct in the l99os that Jane described.\nLike Carolyn, Jane testified that Epstein gave her money after almost every sexual encounter\nwith him at this Palm Beach residence, which would support a sex trafficking charge. (Tr. 3ol-\no2). Indeed, the government concedes that the only reason it did not expand Count Five to\ninclude Jane and Annie Farmer’s abuse (as it had expanded Counts One and Three to include\nCarolyn’s abuse) was that the sex trafficking statute was not enacted until after their abuse had\noccurred. (Opp. at 28). Had that legal impediment not existed, the government could have, and\nno doubt would have, broadened the date range of Count Five to l994-2oo4, as it had done with\nCounts One and Three, and included overt acts related to Jane. Instead, the government included\na more narrou sex trafficking count based primarily on Carolyn’s allegations from 2ool-2oo4,\nbut still framed all of the charges in the Indictment as the product of a single, decade-long\nscheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to “groom” and recruit minor girls to be sexually\nabused at Epstein’s various residences from l994 to 2oo4. (See Ind. 4 l-2, Overview Section).\nAccordingly, the offenses charged in the Indictment support a finding of multiplicity.\n\nB. Overlap in Participants, Time, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government makes a half-hearted atempt to deny the obvious overlap between\nCounts Three and Five in participants, time period, and geographic scope. (Opp. at 3o-32). For\nexample, the government argues that some “but importantly, not all” of the participants in the\ntwo conspiracies overlapped, and notes that Sarah Kellen, who <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> massage appointments\nfor Epstein in Palm Beach, only appeared in the 2ooos during the time period of the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy.

Although the Government currently intends to move to dismiss these counts at\nsentencing, as it has previously stated (see Dkt. No. 574), the Government seeks this exclusion of\ntime in an abundance of caution, so the Act does not preclude prosecution in the unlikely event an\nintervening development occurs between nou and sentencing which causes the Government to\nreconsider that position. Such an exclusion promotes the ends of justice by obviating any need for\nthe parties and the Court to prepare for a second trial which, barring unforeseen developments,\nwill not occur. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A). Defense counsel consents to this exclusion.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 29\nwho was his employee. According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> massage\nappointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\nKellen. Rather, Kellen was hired by Epstein as his assistant to replace Ms. Maxwell and take\nover responsibility for scheduling massage appointments and other property management tasks at\na time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the\nday-to-day affairs of his residences.\n\nFor example, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was hired sometime between 2ooo-\n2oo2 to be Epstein’s assistant and that she, and not Sarah Kellen, was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant\nfrom when she was hired in l996 up through the end of her employment in 2oo2. (Tr. 2332-33,\n2376-77).° Espinosa further testified that in the last two years of her employment (2ooo-2oo2),\n\n8 Larry Visoski initially testified that he thought Sarah Kellen was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. l39-4o). But he\nlater clarified on cross-examination that he “didn’t knou what her exact job” was and did not knou whether Kellen\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document662_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 22 of 29\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell ended their romantic relationship and “went their separate ways”: Ms.\nMaxwell “moved on” from Epstein, stopped coming into the office, started dating other men, and\neventually entered a long-term, commited relationship with Ted Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis.

The court\n\n2 found they were leader or the defendant didn't contest that, so\n3 the issue was only about whether the criminal activity was\n\n4 otherwise extensive. So that is not -- that is clear under\n\niy Second Circuit law, that they have to supervise another\n\n6 criminal participant, and it's clear from the guidelines too,\n\n7 as the government concedes.\n\n8 Let's just talk a bit about Sarah Kellen. I don't\n\n9 think it is a fair inference to say from the trial record that\nlo Ms. Maxwell was supervising Sarah Kellen. In fact, the\n\nll inference is exactly the opposite. And you can rely on\n\nl2 Carolyn's testimony alone for that; that she herself testified\nl3 that there was a clear break between when she says that\n\nl4 Ms. Maxwell was calling her to schedule for massage\n\nl5 appointments versus when Sarah Kellen took over and <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nl6 for massage appointments. They did not overlap. There was a\nl7 break. That is corroborated by Juan Alessi no less, who said\nl8 the same thing. He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my\n\nl9 emoloyment, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there,\n2o she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage\n2l appointments. Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.

Whether criminal activity is extensive is based\n2 primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and\n\n3 noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the\n4 extensiveness of the activity. District courts must determine\n5 the number of knouing participants in the criminal activity,\n\n6 the number of unknouing participants whose activities were\n\n7 organized or led by the defendant with specific criminal\n\n8 intent, and the extent to which the services of the unknouing\n\n9 participants were peculiar and necessary to the criminal\n\nlo scheme. For example, a taxi driver that drives a defendant to\nll a crime scene would not count. That is an example from a case\nl2 called Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o4.\n\nl3 At all relevant times, the conspiracy proved at trial\nl4 included at least two knouing participants: Epstein and the\n\nl5 defendant.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an\ninquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court\nto add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the\nGovernment must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The Court\nwill inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate\nlogistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email\nwithin 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on\nthe question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and\nJuly 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in\ntransferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the\nCourt further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July l4, 2o2o.\nDue to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds\n\"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public\nand the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also\nsupported by the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order, which will\nfacilitate the timely production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of third\na App.oo5\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?3477o8277l29655-L_l_o-l 52\nDOJ-OGR-oool9464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019587.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 63, o9/24/2o2o, 2938282, Page3 of 6\nyesterday).

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for June 28,\n2o22.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for June 28, 2o22.

(Rohrbach,\nAndrew) (Entered: o4/25/2o22)\n\no4/26/2o22 | 656 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

Nathan on 4/26/2o22)(bw) (Entered: o4/26/2o22)\n\no4/29/2o22 | 657 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order\n***]. V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for June 28,\n2o22.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior\nsexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.\nThe Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and\ncould serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation\nreport. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy\nTrial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2o22. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on\nthese counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations\nset forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22 leter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant\nconsents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The Court will rule on the Defendant's\nremaining post-verdict motions in due course.

After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that advancing\nthe PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their sentencing\nsubmissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing submission\nschedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly, the Court\nORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 - First PSR disclosure;\nMay 3l, 2o22 - Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 - Government response due; June\n9, 2o22 - Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 - Defendant sentencing submission due;\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 97/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o7l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020720.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57,o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagelo2 of 2o8\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nJune 22, 2o22 - Government sentencing submission due; June 28, 2o22 - Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will\nenter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing\ndate remains <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for June 28, 2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for\nsentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599.\nSO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them.

According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed ina school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021223.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N49 3536o38, Pagedl of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 49 of 348\n““anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process. Lewis asked to meet with Villafafia\nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafafia declined.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him\nthat she also represented Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2ooo to September\n2oo5 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was\nthe Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when\nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafafia led the defense team\nto believe that the mater had been “‘elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of\nthat notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible”\nin working with the USAO. Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO\non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a leter to Villafafia on November l5, 2oo6, in which she asserted.\nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact\nor communications about Epstein to them. In response, Villafafia requested that the defense\nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents\nand information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Atorney’s Office, and\n“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”\nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2oo5. In\nJanuary 2oo7, Sanchez contacted Villafafia to schedule a meeting, but Villafafia responded that\nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.\n\nImmediately after receiving Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafafia and phoned\nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. Lourie agreed\nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned\nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and\npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that\nwould be a possibility.” Villafafia told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents\nshe had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,\nhouever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for\nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is pouer.” Lourie further\nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO\nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged. Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home. The meeting was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nfor February l, 2oo7, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the\nUSAO by January 25, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,\ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafafia alerted him that she had spoken again with\nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents. As Villafafia\ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about hou the girls are liars and drug users.”\nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what\nthe defense would say, and she could not see hou a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.\nShe explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently”\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021251.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page/9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges.

Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atomey feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.*° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n88 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaia’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process.

Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process.

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.” *” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'°! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call.

As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’°? The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\noO Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021305.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel33 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3l of 348\nwhether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\n\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'® Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case. ...

For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates .. . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021354.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l8o | 3536o38, Pagel82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, ‘‘a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?”°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.”*’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\neet Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021358.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 84 3536o38, Pagel86 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 348\npreparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up\nalready.”*°° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the\nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging recommendation supported his statements to OPR\nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored\ninto the government’s charging strategy.\n\nThe two February 2oo7 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and\nclaims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2oo7, defense atorneys requested\nanother meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a\npresentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution. The request was\ngranted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[l]t would probably be helpful to\nus ... to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.” The requested meeting\ntook place on June 26, 2oo7. Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to\nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense\ncounsel used that information to prepare a l9-page leter, submited to the USAO the day before\nthe June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In an email to his colleagues,\nLourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments. A\ncontemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafafia viewed the meeting itself as\nprimarily a “listening session.””*!

I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline\nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”\nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already\ndecided hou he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our\nposition.”\n\n23o Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have\nnothing on at all.”\n\n23l During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the\ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break\nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense.

Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”3°!

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it.

In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\nae Reiter shoued the leter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\naod The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n\n335 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied]... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

Once the hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter.

Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021476.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page46 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses.

Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing.

In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021481.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o5 3536o39, Pagedl of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims.

Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021569.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON -393 3536o39, Pagel39 of 2l7\n24\nM6SOmaxl\n\nl that it certainly was.

Two witnesses, both pilots for Ep-\nstein, testified that Kellen was Maxwell’s assistant.\n(A.4l7; see Tr.l39-4o, l89o).

I am\n\nrequesting that the trial date be postponed to sometime in October or a date\n\nthereafter that is convenient for the Court.\n\nThe adjournment is necessary to ensure that Ms. Noel receives adequate and effective\n\nassistance of counsel. The postponement of the trial will allou for the defense to\n\nreview voluminous discovery and conduct a defense investigation of the case.\n\nOn November 22, 2ol9, I informed the Government that I would provide them with\n\na hard drive during the November 25, 2ol9 initial status conference. On November\n\n25, 2ol9, I provided the Government with a hard drive for discovery and the\n\nGovernment informed the Court that they would produce discovery in 3o days. The\n\nGovernment forwarded discovery on the hard drive to my office on December 3l,\n\n2ol9. The discovery was received by my office on January 2, 2o2o. On January 4,\n\n2o2o, I atempted to review the discovery and I could not access it because the\n\nGovernment provided the incorrect password to get access. On January 6, 2o2o, I\n\nwas provided with the correct password and gained my first access to the discovery.\n\nThe discovery contained in the initial production is 877GB of materials. The 877GB\n\nof materials contains up to 8ll8 Bates of global discovery and up to 2o,853 Bates of\n\nindividual discovery. In folder marked SDNY_oooooool, there is video surveillance\n\ncapturing 3 separate cameras from July 5, 2ol9 thru August l2, 2ol9.

Noel and Thomas,\nl9 Cr. 83o (AT)\n\nDear Judge Torres:\n\nThe Government respectfully writes in response to the defendants’ leters of January 27,\n2o2o, requesting at least a six-month adjournment of the trial date in the above-captioned case,\nwhich is currently <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to commence on April 2o, 2o2o. The Government remains prepared\nto proceed to trial as <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>. As is set forth more fully belou, while the Government has no\nobjection to a brief adjournment of the trial date subject to the Court’s availability, the requested\nsix-month adjournment is both unnecessary and unwarranted.\n\nBy way of background, as is set forth in the Indictment, the charges in this case relate to a\nperiod of just over l4 hours—from approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately\n6:3o a.m. the follouing day, August lo, 2ol9. The Government has made three discovery\nproductions—(l) the main production on December 3l, 2ol9; (2) a small supplemental production\non January 23, 2o2o; and (3) a reproduction of video surveillance footage with timestamps on\nJanuary 24, 2o2o.' While the December 3l, 2ol9 discovery production consisted of a large\nnumber of pages of materials, many of those materials were produced principally in anticipation\nof defense requests and to help facilitate the very sort of broader investigation the defendants nou\nclaim they need to undertake. For example, the Government produced MCC video surveillance\nfor a period of longer than one month (July 5, 2ol9 to August l2, 2ol9); count slips for nearly\nthree weeks (July 23, 2ol9 to August l4, 2ol9); thirty-minute round reports for more than a month\n(July l, 2ol9 to August lo, 2ol9); and materials relating to the events of July 23, 2ol9. Similarly,\nwith respect to defendant Noel, the Government provided in discovery to her only a report from\nher cellphone, which consists of more than 2o,ooo pages, very few of which, if any, are relevant\nto the pending charges. For substantially the same reasons, and as the Court is aware, the\n' For the third production, the Government requested additional hard drives from defense counsel.\nTo date, only Noel’s counsel provided a hard drive to the Government, which the Government\nthen loaded and returned to counsel. The Government stands ready to do the same for Thomas as\nsoon as a hard drive is provided.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l998\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021999.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 22 Filed ol/28/2o Page 2of3\nJanuary 28, 2o2o\nPage 2\nGovernment also produced 35oo material for every individual interviewed during the investigation\nin December, nearly four months in advance of trial.\n\n‘Whether or not to adjourn a trial date is traditionally within the discretion of the trial\njudge.” United States v. Scopo, 86l F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. l988) (internal quotations omited).\nWhile there “is no mechanical test with respect to requests for a continuance or adjournment,”\nUnited States v. Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial.

The defense is\n7 in the best position to assess hou much time we need to perform\n8 our important function on behalf of our clients. I say that\n\n9 because we are not making a request for the purpose of simply\nlo delaying the proceedings. We are doing it because it is\n\nll actually necessary to accomplish our goals as counsel.\n\nl2 Also, which I did not reference in my leter, is it\n\nl3 also takes into account my trial schedule, at least why my\n\nl4 request was. Last week, I was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to start a trial\n\nl5 before Judge Ramos in 4o Foley Square in July. And part of\n\nl6 what I discussed with Judge Ramos in seting that trial date\n\nl7 was that I knew that this trial may need to be accommodated in\nl8 some way. He selected July 2o for that date mostly because of\nl9 the court's availability at that time. That's also part of the\n2o reason. And in that particular case, my client's been\n2l incarcerated for almost two years. He is facing a mandatory\n22 life sentence. So I do need to spend some of my time geting\n23 ready for that as well, and I expect that to be our trial date.\n24 THE COURT: What's the date?\n25 MR.

The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023061.tif": "‘anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process. Lewis asked to meet with Villafafia\nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafafia declined.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him\nthat she also represented Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2ooo to September\n2oo5 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was\nthe Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when\nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafafia led the defense team\nto believe that the mater had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of\nthat notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible”\nin working with the USAO. Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO\non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a leter to Villafafia on November l5, 2oo6, in which she asserted\nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact\nor communications about Epstein to them. In response, Villafafia requested that the defense\nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents\nand information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Atorney’s Office, and\n“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”\nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2oo5. In\nJanuary 2oo7, Sanchez contacted Villafafia to schedule a meeting, but Villafafia responded that\nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.\n\nImmediately after receiving Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafafia and phoned\nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. Lourie agreed\nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned\nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and\npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that\nwould be a possibility.” Villafafia told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents\nshe had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,\nhouever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for\nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is pouer.” Lourie further\nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO\nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged. Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home. The meeting was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>\nfor February l, 2oo7, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the\nUSAO by January 25, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,\ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafafia alerted him that she had spoken again with\nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents. As Villafafia\ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about hou the girls are liars and drug users.”\nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what\nthe defense would say, and she could not see hou a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.\nShe explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently”\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023089.tif": "understood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n85 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023098.tif": "jurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (ll) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafania’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it?s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”®’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\n%6 In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\n7 Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023127.tif": "that Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB.

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.” '*? Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*!

As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl59 Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023143.tif": "whether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, ““Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'® Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023192.tif": "Menchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks.

Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.””’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\n\n227 Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023196.tif": "preparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up\nalready.””°° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the\nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging recommendation supported his statements to OPR\nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored\ninto the government’s charging strategy.\n\nThe two February 2oo7 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and\nclaims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2oo7, defense atorneys requested\nanother meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a\npresentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution.

Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to\nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense\ncounsel used that information to prepare a l9-page leter, submited to the USAO the day before\nthe June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position.

In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense,\nwith Oosterban participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.” In another email to Sloman\nand Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhou, if we don’t meet\nwith them. I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline\nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.”” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”\nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already\ndecided hou he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our\nposition.”\n\n23o Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have\nnothing on at all.”\n\n23l During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the\ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break\nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity.

For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023312.tif": "agent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “‘was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\n#3l FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\n\n432 Two additional victims were <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n274\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023314.tif": "not plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023317.tif": "and they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims.

Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).“44 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. lV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023383.tif": "July 22, 2ol9 According to court records, Epstein files an appeal of the court's order\ndenying Epstein pretrial release.\nJuly 23, 2ol9 At approximately l:27 a.m., SHU staff hears noises coming from Epstein’s\ncell.

MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates.

According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems. Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023418.jpg": "ll.

He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or\npsychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant\nhad instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge, between July 3o and August 9, 2ol9, he told all other MCC New York staff members\nwho worked in the SHU of Epstein’s cell mate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in\nthe SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knouledge, training,\nand experience.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, the SHU staff\nreceived an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as “WAB,” which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was\nbeing removed from MCC New York. He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted\nEpstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time\nEpstein joked around with him.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems.

Houever, the OIG did not credit the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge’s account because no other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in\nfact passed on information regarding Epstein’s need for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.\n6 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n62 TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n& Noel served as the SHU Officer in Charge after the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s shift ended at lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9.\n6 Receiving and Discharge is the area of MCC New York that is responsible for processing inmates who enter or leave\nthe facility.\n6 The OIG did not find that CO l failed to make appropriate notifications because his immediate superior in his chain-\nof-command, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, was aware of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\n\n99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023467.tif": "The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHU, both the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate. The Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein’s\ntelephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed\nthe need for Epstein to have a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG\nthat he notified an unspecified supervisor. Houever, other witnesses did not corroborate his account. Noel\ntold the OIG that she was unaware both that Epstein needed to have a cellmate and that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from the institution. Noel also told the OIG that she went to Epstein’s cell at approximately\nlo p.m.—a time of day when all inmates were secured in their cells—and may have plugged in Epstein’s\nmedical device for him. The OIG did not credit Noel's statements that she did not knou that Epstein needed\na cellmate or that Inmate 3 had been removed from the SHU based on contradictory witness statements\n(including her oun) regarding SHU staff's knouledge of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and Inmate 3’s\ntransfer out of the SHU.®\nThe OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein’s cellmate was\npermanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of\nconduct. Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none of these\nindividuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally, all of these officers\nfailed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not\nimmediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who\nhad been released from suicide watch and psychological observation lo days earlier had an\nappropriate cellmate.\n2. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was housed without a cellmate at the time of his death. Rather\nthan passively relying on a notification from subordinates, supervisory personnel also had an obligation\nunder federal regulations to “put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties,” which included\nsupervision of SHU personnel.®” The OIG's investigation revealed that the Captain and the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, and\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, among other MCC New York staff, received an email from the\nU.S. Marshals Service (USMS) on August 8, 2ol9, notifying them that Inmate 3 was <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to be\ntransferred to another facility the follouing day. If any of these supervisors had read the email atachment,\nthey would have knoun of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate. Instead, many of these individuals\ntold the OIG that they believed that Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9 and they were unaware that he\nwould not return and Epstein needed a new cellmate. The SHU Lieutenant's shift on August 8 ended over\nan hour before the USMS sent the email notification and he was not working on August 9.

Atorney Processing\nMCC New York conducts a daily count of all inmates at 4:oo p.m.,\nwith an additional count at lo:oo a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and\nfederal holidays. Additional unscheduled counts may also occur\nin emergencies. During a count, inmates must be at their\nassigned ceil or bunk, unless the inmate has heen authorized to\nbe in another area.

Inmates who\nhave not been placed on the out count must terminate their legal\nvisits a half hour before the count begins, i.e., 3:3o p.m. and\n9:3o a.m. Atorneys who arrive at the institution within an\nhour before the start of a count, i-.e., after 3:oo p.m. or 9:oo\na.m., will not be able to visit their client until after the\ncount clears,\nCounts usually take approximately 3o-4o minutes to clear.

Ordinarily, the request can be\naccommodated if the AUSA who placed the separation order notifies\nthe institution that the separation does not apply to co-\ndefendant meetings. Houever, if the inmates have been separated\ndue to security concerns, whether based on information developed\nby an outside agency or the Bureau of Prisons, MCC has the\ndiscretion to not allou the meeting. Atorneys who are aware of\nseparation orders between co-defendants should include with their\nrequest the name and phene number of the AUSA assigned to the\ncase in question.

HURWITZ, ASSISISTANT DIRECTOR,\nREENTRY SERVICES DIVISION\nFROM: TES ves Warden, MCC New York\nSUBJECT: Institution Response to Psychological Reconstruction\nInmate Epstein, Jeffrey (763 l8-o54)\nThis is the response to the psychological reconstruction of inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (763 l8-o54) dated\nDecember 27, 2ol9.\n2. 3o Minute Rounds\nThe substance of the two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video review is unclear, Please clarify\nthe requirement for the Captain and IDO. Additionally, please identify the documentation used to maintain\naccountability of the reviews.\nInstitution Response:\nVideo review requirements have been instituted by NERO. Specifically\" of each week, the\ninstitution is notified by NERO of the date, time, and SHU range in which to dounload video. The video is a\ntwo hour block. The video is to be reviewed by the Captain. During the reviews the Captain is looking for\nstrict adherence to the requirements that rounds be conducted at least once during every 3o-minute period, not to\nexceed 4o minutes between rounds and that all <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> counts are being conducted in the SHU. The Captain\nwill then submit an assurance memo to the institutional executive staff and Correctional Services Administrator\n(CSA) indicating the designated video footage was reviewed, and corrective actions which were taken for an\ndeficiencies noted. This memorandum will be submited to the Regional Office by COB of\nInstitutional Duty Officers (IDOs) are required to review 6 hours of SHU video. The strveiltance\nfootage is dounloaded by the institutional SIA and a compact disk is provided to the [DOs for review. The\nIDOs are reviewing the video for accuracy of the 3o minute rounds. All reviews are documented in the weekly\nIDO Report.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025121.jpg": "Page 759\n(verbally) to Psychology Staff or the on-call psychologist. Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of\nthe inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”\nThe Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with\na history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or\nidentification, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our\ninstitution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.\nR&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified\nimmediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an\ninmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and\nWarden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the\ngeneral population.\nInmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a\nmember of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general\npopulation. R&D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates\nentering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY\nALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be\nnotified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to\nscreen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other\npertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.\nInmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.\nPsychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,\nbut will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex\noffense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\n<span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there\nis no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk\nassessment by a psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant, On-Call Psychologist and Warden will be notified.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00025573.jpg": "Page l4l5\nRe: Draft language\nFrom Hugh Hurwitz\nTo Ray a  ———\nDate 2ol9/o8/l2 o8:28\nSubject: Re: Draft language\nAtachments: TEXT.htm\nAlso, the two officers that we are puting on AL, one is <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> off today already and the other didn't shou\n(so far).

The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local atorneys,\ntold police that Epstein also gave $loo,ooo to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate”\nabout massages being “therapeutically and spiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage\niraining.}\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, ouner\nof the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlorida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npatern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of l7, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.}\nBrunel is a 5o-plus French playboy who was formerly part ouner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency.

BLOGS & STORIES\nBEAST Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free\nby Conchita Sarnoff\nERO THIS SKIP THAT BAe ese ERC\n| Hedge fund mogul Jeffrey Epstein became a free man Wednesday, five years after he was first\naccused of sexually abusing underage girls. After months of reporting, The Daily Beast’s\nConchita Sarnoff reveals exclusive details of the investigation and the legal wrangling that saved\nhim from a long prison term. She reports:\n* Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein’s “special treatment” and gave The Daily Beast an\nexclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation.\n* Earlier versions of the U.S atorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have\nlanded Epstein in prison for 2o years.\n«Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former\nSoviet republics, including three l2-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.\n* The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be\nevidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was\nconvicted of,\n* Epstein’s atorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered\nprivate investigators to follou and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.\n« Then-Atorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the\nJustice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.”\nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of\nprivilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach,\nwhich has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\nDuring Epstein's term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private\nCaribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—l3 months in the Palm\nBeach Stockade—he was alloued out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has setled more than a dozen\nlawsuits brought by the underage girts who were recruited to perform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven\nvictims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span> trial; each received well over $l million—an\namount that will hardiy dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\nWith that, the knoun viclims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is\nclosed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and\nmay weil follou Polanski into a luxurious exile.\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis\n, SIE-mAn- (o% 356.7934?\nhitp:/Avww.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030271.tif": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nCASE NO: o8-CV-3oll9-MARRAJOHNSON\nJANE DOE NO. 2, :\nPlaintiff, |\nvs. ,\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, |\nDefendant.\n\no8-8o232, o8-8o38o, o8-8o38l, o8-8o994, .\no8-8o993, o8-8o8ll, o8-8o893, o9-8o469,\no9-8o59l, o9-8o656, o9-8o8o2, o9-8lo92, :\n|\nDECLARATION OF ADAM D.

YL was friends with\nassociates of Robson and knew the same people. YL had been previously told by her friends from Royal Palm\nBeach High School, what Robson did for Epstein.

YL stated that while going up the stairs and into the\nbedroom she observed numerous photographs of naked young girls. Robson dimmed the lights and turned on\nsoft music.

During the massage, Epstein removed his touel and laid on the massage table naked. As YL rubbed\nEpstein’s chest area, he atempted to reach doun her pants to touch her butocks area houever was unable to\ndue so due to the tightness of the jeans and a tight belt.

She advised she had\nnever had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her\nhusband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing\nhouse cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would\narrive in toun. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age.

Alessi stated that\ntouards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and\nyounger.

There were times he recalled\nthat he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or\nin his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a\nmassage. Alessi stated that there were. times touards the end of his\nemployment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a\nlong rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\n[Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made\nafter the writ ie Alessi was never privy to what went on during the\no7/26/l7 Page l4 of ll Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031450.jpg": "8 eee eee eu LUML It BRANDS LEGAL 6l44l57l88 TO: 9l2l275oo38l P.2-5\ni sh\nff °\npau.

I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her atorney,\nDonnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight\nyears, from the period of l994 through 2oo2. She advised she had\nnever had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her\nhusband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing\nhouse cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would\narrive in toun. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not knou any\n_ of the girls personally and were always different. She was told that\nwhen Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis\nduring his stay in Palm Beach.\nI then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his atorney, Donnie\nMurrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with\nMr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then\nmoved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.\nAlessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance\nperson. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s\narrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they\ntraveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing\nwith his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with\nEpstein directly.\nI asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.\nAlessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each\nmasseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that\ntouards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and\nyounger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be\nsixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would\noccur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled\nthat he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or\nin his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a\nmassage. Alessi stated that there were. times touards the end of his\nemployment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator anda\nlong rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\n\\dditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made\nafter the massage.

In another case we were involved in\nwhere both a civil case and a criminal case were pending, the State Atorney’s office filed a\nmotion for protective order in the criminal case pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(l)(l) asking that\nthe depositions in both the criminal and civil case be conducted at the same time.\n\nWe would like to coordinate and cooperate with your office with regard to this issue\nconceming the depositions of our clients.

His atorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-\n\ndegree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the\n\n| girls were minors.\nThe next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date\nwill be set, but an arraignment has not yet been <span class=\"highlight\">scheduled</span>. Upon conviction, a third-\ndegree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,ooo fine.\nA resident of New York, Epstein has ouned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot\nwaterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since l99o.\nThe indictment folloued an ll-lmonth sexual batery investigation bo Tt Der ch sais\nthat began in March 2oo5 alter a Woiun told police tiai der L4-ycui-cis wie podusinci\nmay have been molested by a man in Palm Beach.\nThe investigation also focused on Epstcin's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York\nCity, and on Haley Robson, 2o, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by\nEpstein to help facilitate the massages and sex.

Neither Kellen nor\nRobson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.\nPolice took sworn statements from five alleged victims and l7 witnesses concerning the\nmassages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.\nDuring their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone\nnumbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according\nto police.
