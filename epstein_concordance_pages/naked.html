The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003719.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagellofl6\n\nThe government complains that Ms. Maxwell has not cited any cases where a perjury\ncount was dismissed pretrial for “fundamental ambiguity.” Resp. l2o. Of course, the government\nmust knou that myriad examples exist. United States v. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236—37\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2), is instructive:\n\nSuccinctly, the prosecutor did not fulfill her obligation to “pin the witness doun to\n\nthe specific object of [her] inquiry.” Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 36o. Any number of\n\nstraightforward follou-up questions could have clarified the object of inquiry. For\n\nexample, in addition to the “atempt” question mentioned earlier, the government\n\ncould have cured the ambiguity by supplying the date, time or location of the target\n\nmeeting, focusing Cicalese's atention on the specific events at\n\nissue. See Razzaia, 37o F.Supp. at 578-79. Left <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span>, the government's imprecise\n\nquestion did not meet the standard set in Bronston. It cannot provide a jury with\n\na sufficient basis to reasonably conclude that Cicalese willfully lied by answering\n\nas he did. Jd. at 579. Asking simple follou-up questions could have resolved the\n\nimprecision and fulfilled the government's obligation under Bronston. Whether by\n\nstrategy or inadvertence, the government did not do so.\nThe Court granted Cicalese's motion to dismiss the charges against him. /d. at 232.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Landau, 737 F. Supp. 778 (S.D.N.Y. l99o), the court\ndismissed a perjury indictment, holding “the context of all the preceding questions and Landau's\ngrand jury testimony as a whole, the prosecutor's questions here are fundamentally ambiguous\nand cannot as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004687.jpg": "— Case l 2o-croo33o-PAE Document 293-3 Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 34_——__--—_\nI\n. 27\n2 |teke <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> photographs of i =\n3 |Mr.z Epslein\"'s regidence in and around bre house :\n4 and pool area st the rcequest of Mr. Epstein. ¢\nke G And approximately hou etd or hou oid |\nB & f  Y infermed us that she\n© jwas l6 years ald when ee: :- the\nlo {photographs of hes <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span>.\nl7 O Woat did er say about\nl2 jwhether Jeffrey Epstein knew her true age?\n. l3 5 [ER «>: etorcca by\n., l4 Pee Say if asked her age that she\nl & was -- the should respond that she was l7, When )\nl6 |they went -- and went to Mr. Epstein's residence |\nl7 |and were upstairs performing massages, Mr. Epstein |\nl3 She responded four --; And then he |\n2o sad, so you're l47 And Mr. Epatein informed [| |\n2l ae >=: they would just keep that |\n22 joetween them. |\n23 ia) So in ether words, he knew that she was\n24 l4 when she started seeing him?\n25 & Yes.

Thomas wanted to be an actress and a model. Her agent told her that\nCosby was looking to mentor a promising young talent. Eventually, Cosby invited\nThomas to Reno for some personal acting lessons. Thomas believed that she would be\nstaying at a hotel, but, when she got to Reno, a car took her to a ranch house where\nCosby was staying. Cosby arranged a room in the house for her. When they were the\nonly two people left in the house, Cosby asked Thomas to audition for him by pretending\nto be an intoxicated person, which she explained to Cosby would be a challenge for her\nbecause she had never been intoxicated. Cosby asked hou she could play such a role\nwithout ever having had that experience. So, he gave her some wine. Thomas drank\nonly a litle of the wine before becoming extremely intoxicated. She faded in and out of\nconsciousness. At one point she came to on a bed only to find Cosby forcing his penis\ninto her mouth. She passed out and awoke later feeling sick.\n\nChelan Lasha. Lasha met Cosby in l986, while she was working as an actress\nand model. She was only seventeen years old. Cosby was forty-eight. Cosby called her\nat her home, and later visited her there. Lasha then sent him modeling shots and spoke\nwith him a number of times on the phone about her career. Cosby invited her to meet\nhim in Las Vegas, where, he told her, someone would take beter pictures of her. He\nimplied that she could get a role on “The Cosby Shou.” Enticed by the prospect, Lasha\nwent to Las Vegas. As promised, once there, someone took pictures of her. Someone\nelse gave her a massage. Eventually, Lasha was alone with Cosby. He gave her a blue\npill, which he said was an antihistamine that would help with a cold from which she was\nsuffering.

The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind.

Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936).

Limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire will help uncover any potential bias in the jury pool.\nCONCLUSION\nVoir dire is a mutual search between lawyers and the Court to determine whether a\nparticular individual can ensure integrity of the trial process in each case.

But most of Jane’s testimony about the massage room does not concern “movable\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page5of9\nitems.” (l2/3/2l Tr. at lo76). Much of it concerns fixtures: the room’s size, its dark and reddish\nwallpaper and curtains, its built-in bookcase, and its wooden molding. Those cannot be removed\nfrom the room without a renovation—in some cases, a significant renovation.\n\nEven those items that are “movable” are consistent with Epstein’s longstanding practices,\nand therefore still probative. Jane did not testify to any art in the massage room, and the\nGovernment would not argue that the particular nude artwork in the exhibits was present while\nJane was abused. But there is evidence of Epstein’s practice of displaying depictions of <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span>\nwomen in his homes from the mid-l99os through the mid-2ooos, through both Jane’s testimony\nand evidence of the search of his Palm Beach house. The artwork in Epstein’s home at the time\nof the search is a continuation of that practice and tends to make it make it more likely that Jane’s\ntestimony was accurate. That is all that is required to shou relevance.\n\nAt a more general level, this evidence is probative that Jane knew hou Epstein decorated\nhis New York massage room. It was dark, red, with curtains, a built-in bookcase, and a stereo\nsystem. It was in a house decorated with wood, wallpaper, and artwork shouing nude women.\nThe jury will knou full well, and the defense will surely argue, that time has passed since the mid-\nl99os. But that argument goes to weight, not whether the evidence is relevant at all. A jury could\nreasonably conclude that it is no coincidence that these photos match Jane’s description—it is\nbecause Jane has been in this room.\n\nIf the Court remains concerned about the relevance of movable property, the Government\ncan offer photos that redact the artwork.

Annie did not want to go to New Mexico after Epstein had caressed and held Annie’s hand\nand rubbed her foot and leg while watching a movie at a theater in New York in December l995.\n(PSR ¥ 48). Despite those misgivings, Annie felt more comfortable going to New Mexico once\nshe understood that the defendant, a groun woman in a romantic relationship with Epstein, would\nbe there with Annie. (PSR § 49). Yet, when Annie found herself alone at Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico with just Epstein and the defendant, she found that the defendant was anything but a\nprotector. (PSR § 5o). Instead, Annie found that the purpose of the trip was to groom her for\nsexual abuse.\n\nDuring the New Mexico trip, the defendant took steps to normalize sexual contact under\nthe ruse of massage. The defendant asked Annie if she had ever had a professional massage, and\nsaid that she wanted Annie to have that experience and that she would be happy to give Annie a\nmassage. (PSR 452). After telling Annie to get undressed, the defendant gave Annie a massage\non a massage table while Annie was <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span>. (/d.). During the massage, the defendant rubbed\nAnnie’s body and directed Annie to roll over so that Annie was laying on her back. (/d.).

Annie testified that she wanted “badly to get off of the\ntable and have this massage be done.” (/d.). The defendant sexually abused a teenage girl in an\neffort to groom her for further abuse.\n\nFollouing through on that plan on this same New Mexico trip, Epstein later got into\nAnnie’s bed, cuddled with her, pressed his body into her, and rubbed against her.

The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021667.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page2o of 93\n7\n\ngave Jane instructions about touching Epstein’s penis.\n(Tr.3o8-ll).

(Tr.3ll).\nJane also traveled with Maxwell (who assisted Jane in\nmaking travel arrangements) and Epstein to Epstein’s\ntounhouse in New York City and his ranch in New\nMexico, where she was sexually abused. (Tr.3l6-24).\n\n2. Sexual Abuse of Kate\n\nMaxwell and Epstein’s sexual abuse of Kate started\nin l994, around the same time that Maxwell and Ep-\nstein started sexually abusing Jane. (Tr.ll72, ll79-\n86). After Kate, then l7 years old, told Maxwell that\nshe lived alone with her mother and had a difficult\nhome life, Maxwell introduced Kate to Epstein in Lon-\ndon. (Tr.ll78-82). Maxwell delivered Kate to a <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span>\nEpstein in Maxwell’s oun home for massages and told\nKate to “have a good time.” (Tr.ll82-89). During these\nmassages, Epstein initiated sexual contact. Ud.).\n\nKate traveled to meet both Maxwell and Epstein in\nPalm Beach, the Virgin Islands, and New York City\nbetween the ages of l8 and 24. (Tr.ll9o-98). Epstein\ninitiated sexual activity with Kate every time she vis-\nited him. (/d.).

Maxwell then offered to give Annie a\nmassage. (Tr.2o84-85).

(Tr.2o86-87,\n2224). But when Annie managed to extricate herself\nfrom the situation by running to the bathroom,\nthereby denying Epstein further sexual contact, Max-\nwell seemed “very disinterested” in Annie for the re-\nmainder of the trip. (Tr.2o86-88).\n\n4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts\n\nBeginning in or about the summer of 2ooo, Max-\nwell and Epstein entered a new phase of their scheme\nto sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Max-\nwell recruited a l7-year-old girl named Virginia Rob-\nerts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Ep-\nstein with massages. (Tr.84o-46).

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n° In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028902.tif": "wesc THE PALM BEACH POST = * WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 2oo6 55\nPolice key h on h airpc ifted through trash\n-Folice kept watch on home, airport, sifted through tras\nsaid.

The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the\nmaster bedroom area, is lined with photos of <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span>\nyoung females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the\nhouse.

Several massage\ntables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located\nin the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located\nwhich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras.

Several massage\ntables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located\nin the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\nCaribbean—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the apartment in Parts ... Hou did he gct\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He’s very mysterious. Not that many\npeople get close to bim. Not that many people knou him.”\nThe descriptions of Epstein’s character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at\n‘y varal distance from normal humanity, He lives i what is described as the largest private residence in\n“*onhatan. ahout 5o.ooo square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 7lst. Visitors report a\nstufted poodle is on the piano. The house, said one visitor. is like what Hollywood might imagine when\nfoes to shou the supernch. When Epstem noticed the visitor's astanishment at his surroundings he\n*-ined against a wall with a soft smile and tapped the paneling. “it’s all fake “he said.

And even to doubt an expert’s\nstatements.”\nEpstein has been a munificent supporter of cuting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early\nbiotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“Tt was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a litle food out, lovely hors d’ oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall I say\n\n| this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it7” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say ‘What’s\ngoing on here?” and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling are of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter bad been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary -admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe schoo] with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and Jotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in,\n<span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhi 28ieaw vrinthis clickahility cam /nt/ent?aieeSF oft D2 tlo=The+t Panta iPulie Reberds Reqdest N6./l7-295°°\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031406.jpg": "Received: l/l3/o8 3:l5PM; 56l64o442o -> STATE ATTY OFC; Page 5\n@l/ll/2o88 2l:48 56l6484428 x recats BS\n\nNext: The police lock onto Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle.\n\nThe lengthy police narrative in the case doesn’t make clear hou police connected gray-haired Jeff with\nJeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw\nthemselves into an investigation of the moder and palatial house on El Brillo Way.\n\nPalm Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for touering ficus privacy hedges on\nMediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span>. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nne /eibhw printhis.clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acthABeeHie Pa lo=The+Fantacick Pls Recoids, Request Nord Aho\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031407.jpg": "Received: l/l3/o8 3:l6PM; 56l64o442o -> STATE ATTY OFC; Page 6\n8l/ll/2oo8,.2l;48 56l648442 x Page 6 of 9\n\nEpstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge pom is\nmen with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“It was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a Jitle food out, lovely hors d’oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall T say\nthis? —by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it?” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he becarne a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old-—-old-fashioned, unrebabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say “What’s\ngoing on here?’ and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling arc of Epstein’s comet came to an end—vwithout his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary-admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe school with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl lefi school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came m,\n<span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhtn-/Awww nrinthis clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acton=cnt &title=The+Fantasist&exnire=acurl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 24 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032064.jpg": "The Fantasist Page 5 of 9\nNext: The police lock onto Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle.\n\nThe lengthy police narrative in the case doesn’t make clear hou police connected gray-haired Jeff with\nJeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw\nthemselves into an investigation of the modern and palatial house on El Brillo Way.\n\nPaim Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for touering ficus privacy hedges on\nMediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span>. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nhtn-//Awww nrinthis.clickahilitv.com/pt/cot?action=cnt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\n\no7/26/l7 Page 25 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\na DOJ-OGR-ooo32o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032065.jpg": "The Fantasist sae OR\nEpstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a <span class=\"highlight\">naked</span> woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge porn is\nmen with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\nHis claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like\nyoung women.’ ~ '\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.
