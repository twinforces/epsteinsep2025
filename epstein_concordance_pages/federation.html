The Claims Raised in the Petition Must Be Dismissed for Lack of Subject\n\nMater Jurisdiction Because the Petitioners Lack Standing to Bring Those Claims.\n\nThese proceedings pursuant to the CVRA must be dismissed for lack of subject mater\njurisdiction because Petitioners lack standing to pursue the remedies that they are seeking for\nalleged CVRA violations. As the Supreme Court has explained,\n\nto satisfy Article II’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must shou (l) it has\n\nsuffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or\n\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the\nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v.
