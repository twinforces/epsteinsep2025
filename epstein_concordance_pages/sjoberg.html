First, as highlighted by the motion, the information purportedly sought is\ncumulative and duplicative. By way of example, Plaintiff has already deposed Johanna <span class=\"highlight\">Sjoberg</span>\n(a former Epstein employee), Juan Alessi (a former Epstein employee), and David Rodgers*\n(former Epstein Pilot). She further seeks to depose Maria Alessi and Jo Fontanella (former\nEpstein household employees), as well as Dana Bums and Emmy Taylor (identified as assistants\nto Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein). The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may\nhave is identical to that of each other — what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff\ngoes so far as to state that Maria Alessi’s deposition is expected to “corroborate” the\nobservations of her husband’s.\n\nPlaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is “obtaining\nwitnesses, like Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Sjoberg</span>, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Yet, Ms.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Sjoberg</span> did not “corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Instead, she testified that [jj\nees\n——————————— Ss\n———$<—— OOOO\nI\nRegardless, Plaintiff is looking in vain for more testimony of exactly the same character,\nprecisely the type of testimony the presumptive limit is intended to prevent.\n\nSimilarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe\nRecarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.\n\n* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the\nscheduled court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs. There are far more convenient, less\nburdensome, and less expensive methods by which such information could have been obtained, such as a verifying\naffidavit, yet Plaintiff chose to unnecessarily burden counsel, the witness and counsel for the witness with a 3 hour\ndeposition to accomplish the same end.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 45\nDisclosure Paterns in Child Sexual Abuse l6l\ndisclosure are higher in the adolescent study than in the adult study, a | ‘The rates for\nreassuring finding given the increased awareness of sexual abuse in society | . : ‘\ndurine the past 2o vears. immediate disclosure\ng the p Ms\nGoodman-Broun and colleagues (2oo3) examined USA district atorney | are louer in the\nfiles of 2l8 children.
