For one thing, it's some unverified list\n\n6 of assets, not audited, not certified, and not very detailed\n\n7 either.\n\n8 Mr. Epstein may be unusual, but there are no\n\n9 obligations, for example, no debts, no expenses. That,\n\nlo depending on if that's true -- maybe he's debt free and\n\nll obligation free. But that would impact whatever the list of\n\nl2 assets were if that were knoun too.\n\nl3 It seems to me you have to knou a -—- there needs to be\nl4 a fuller financial picture to knou what would be appropriate.\nl5 MR.

It was our first\n\nl6 effort, and I am authorized to say to the Court that whatever\nl7 bond you want Mr. Epstein to sign, whether it's $loo million or\nl8 an amount close to the amount of the assets that we have\n\nl9 provided, Mr. Epstein is prepared to sign it.\n2o He intends to appear.

See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

In seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden\nof shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure\nher presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d\n63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\n29. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In\nsuch a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of\npersuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001333.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel6 of 25\nCir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the\nstatutory presumption of detention, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it\nbecomes a factor to be weighed and considered in deciding whether release is\nwarranted. /d.\n\n3o. Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n3l. This Court generally applies “deferential review to a district\ncourt’s order of detention.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir.\n2ol9). It reviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight\nand whether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll);\nUnited States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. l987), and will reverse only if\n“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been commited,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n32.

Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001337.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying <span class=\"highlight\">Temporary</span> Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001338.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2l of 25\n\n38. At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications.

Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release is not “necessary” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “<span class=\"highlight\">Temporary</span> release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant. Maxwell has access to a desktop computer provided by the MDC\nand a laptop provided by the Government for Maxwell’s exclusive use to review\ndiscovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A\nat l7-l8). Also during that time, Maxwell has access to email with defense counsel,\ncalls with defense counsel, and legal visits (depending on pandemic-related\nconditions). (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex.

Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v.

This Court applies “deferential review to a district court’s order\nof detention.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It\nreviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight and\nwhether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v.

See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001457.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel7 of 24\nof confinement do not warrant <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release. Nothing in Maxwell’s renewed\nmotion alters that conclusion.\n\n32. “Asa general mater, this Court will adhere to its oun decision\nat an earlier stage of the litigation.” United States v. Plugh, 648 F.3d ll8, l23 (2d\nCir. 2oll). The “law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for\ncompelling reasons,” such as where there is “an intervening change of controlling\nlaw, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent\nmanifest injustice.” Jd. at l23-24; see also United States v. Tenzer, 2l3 F.3d 34,\n39 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We have stated that we will not depart from this sound policy\nabsent cogent or compelling reasons.”). Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason,\nlet alone a “compelling” reason, Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23, for this Court to reverse its\nprior decision.\n\n33. The only new events that Maxwell cites as justification for her\nrequest that this Court reverse itself is additional leter briefing before the District\nCourt regarding MDC’s nightime security checks. Nothing about that briefing or\nJudge Nathan’s most recent writen order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred\nwhen finding Maxwell poses a flight risk or abused her discretion when determining\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release is not warranted.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001460.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\n<span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool46o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001462.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page22 of 24\n\n38. The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture\nis whether Judge Nathan commited clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight\nrisk or abused her discretion when denying Maxwell <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release. Nothing\nin the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s conclusion that Maxwell poses a\nreal risk of flight. Nor does the renewed motion explain hou Judge Nathan’s\ncareful consideration of the MDC’s nightime security protocols and continued\nmonitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with\ncounsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of discretion. Simply\nput, the renewed motion fails to present any “compelling” reason for this Court to\nreverse its prior decision in this case. Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23.\nto review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. 235 at 7 n.4; Dkt. l96 at l-2).

As the Defendant’s\nresponse makes clear, she seeks to serve a Rule l7 subpoena on BSF because she is dissatisfied\nwith the Government’s discovery efforts thus far. Thus, she is using Rule l7 to atempt to obtain\ndiscovery that she has been unable to obtain from the Government under Rule l6 and Brady,\nincluding discovery that is subject to a pending motion before the Court. This is an improper use\nof a Rule l7 subpoena. If the Defendant believes that the Government has not fulfilled its\ndiscovery obligations under Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio, she must address that issue with the\nGovernment and the Court rather than serving overbroad and burdensome subpoenas on third\nparties. And if the Defendant is not entitled to the discovery she seeks from the Government, then\n: The Defendant refers to BSF’s objections as a “motion to quash,” but the Court has not yet\ngranted Defendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena to BSF.

Thus, Cosby’s jury was selected from residents of\nAllegheny County, and trial commenced. On June l7, 2ol7, after seven days of\ndeliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The trial\ncourt dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial.\n\nAhead of the second trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion seeking to introduce\nthe testimony of a number of additional women who offered to testify about Cosby’s prior\nacts of sexual abuse. Generally, the women averred that, in the l98os, each had an\nencounter with Cosby that involved either alcohol, drugs, or both, that each became\nintoxicated or incapacitated after consuming those substances, and that Cosby engaged\nin some type of unwanted sexual contact with each of them while they were unable to\nresist. The dates of the conduct that formed the basis of these allegations ranged from\nl982 to l989, approximately fifteen to twenty-two years before the incident involving\nConstand. Again, Cosby opposed the motion. Follouing oral argument, and despite\nthere being no change in circumstances other than the first jury’s inability to reach a\nunanimous verdict, the trial court granted the Commonwealth’s motion in part, increasing\nthe number of prior bad acts witnesses alloued at trial from one to five.

But the Protective\nOrder in this case is at least arguably not <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> or limited. It would have expired had the |\ncase gone to trial, but, as the case setled, it appears to me to bind the parties permanently. It is |\ntrue that nothing in the Protective Order seems to prevent either Giuffre or Maxwell from |\nmaking public documents that were designated confidential by that party once the lawsuit is |\nover. Houever, as to documents designated confidential by the other party, the promise of |\nconfidentiality plainly survives termination of the lawsuit—even to the point of requiring that :\nthose materials be returned or destroyed. ;\nThird, the Government argues that applying Martindell to its application here “would risk |\nrendering | Martindell] in even further conflict with the well-reasoned decisions of numerous |\nother Circuits,” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 5 n.3.) Martindell is indeed an outlier; every other Circuit |\n|\nthat has considered the clash between protective orders and grand jury subpoenas has questioned |\nits wisdom and has come up with a standard more favorable to the Government’s position. See |\ngenerally Dane L. Steffenson, Are Rule 26(c) Protective Orders Viable Against Grand Juries?, |\n26 Golden Gate U. L. Rev. l83 (l996); 8A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2o44.l (3d ed. Nov. 2ol8). |\nI happen to agree with the other Circuits, but Martindell is the law in this Circuit, and I am not at |\nliberty to ignore it. |\nThe Government argues that the Court should decline to analyze its request pursuant to |\nMartindell in light of Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), |\nLike this case, Chemical Bank arose in a somewhat unusual posture: a party to a protective order |\nunilaterally approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office, “suggesting that it had :\nevidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” Jd. at 93.

To Be Filed Under Seal\n\n“An examination of Second Circuit case law reveals the follouing factors are relevant\nwhen determining whether a party has reasonably relied on the protective order: (l) the scope of |\nthe protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the level of inquiry the court :\nundertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In re Ethylene |\nPropylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 3o8, 3l8 (D, Conn. 2oo9). |\nThe first factor—the scope of the Protective Order—favors granting the Government’s |\napplication for modification. As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial protective orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no exception. “A broad protective order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more difficult to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The Protective Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (Protective Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> or |\nlimiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in discovery would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the necessary factor)—nof reliance on the protective order.

Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, houever, will be\ndocketed because the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to seal the motion. Even though\nthe motion to intervene is denied, it is a judicial document to which the presumption in favor of\npublic access applies and no interests are served by maintaining it under seal.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Temporary</span> sealing of documents related to the motion for a new trial\n\nThe Court first addresses the Defendant’s request that this Court seal all documents\nrelated to the motion for a new trial either until the motion is resolved or until after a hearing is\nconducted, should one be ordered. Dkt. No. 59o at l-2. The Court considers a request to seal\npursuant to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995)).\n\nBoth parties agree that the motion papers are “judicial document[s] that [are] subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and common law.” Dkt. No. 594\nat 2 (quoting Dkt. No. 59o at 4). Houever, the Defendant argues that sealing pending a hearing\nor resolution is necessary “to ensure the integrity of any fact-gathering process that may take\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008911.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page3of7\nplace” and, more specifically, to “ensure that the most critical evidence to be elicited at the\nhearing—namely, the testimony of Juror 5o—is not tainted by outside information and\ninfluence.” Dkt. No. 59o at 2. The Court agrees that the integrity of any inquiry is a “higher\nvalue” that must be weighed in determining public access to the documents. As the Court has\npreviously articulated, it must “ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going\nforward, should one be ordered,” as “[t]hat too is in the public, as well as the Defendant’s and\nthe Government’s, interest.” Dkt. No. 585.\n\nBut restricting public access to judicial documents, whether through sealing or redaction,\nmust be “narrouly tailored to serve that interest.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. Wholesale sealing\nof the motion papers, even on a <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> basis, is not narrouly tailored to serve the interest in\nensuring the integrity of any potential inquiry. The Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s\nconcern that media interest in the motion warrants <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> sealing of the documents in their\nentirety. Defendant argues that “there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a\nfair trial will be prejudiced by publicity” because coverage “will influence the memories of other\npotential witnesses,” as well as Juror 5o. Dkt. No. 59o at 3-5 (relying on United States v. Silver,\nNo. l5 Cr. 93 (VEC), 2ol6 WL l572993, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l4, 2ol6)). As the Government\nproperly notes, houever, the concern in the pretrial posture, as in Si/ver, is that potential jurors\nmay learn prejudicial information they would otherwise not. Here, houever, the concern is\nentirely absent for at least two reasons. First, much of the information relied upon in the\nDefendant’s motion and the Government’s response is publicly available. And second, the Court\nis the relevant fact-finder with respect to any potential hearing and it is obviously privy to the\ninformation whether filed under seal or filed publicly.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6lo_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagelof3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ee |\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\n\nUnited States of America,\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Defendant contends that the\ncurrent paper record sufficiently supports her motion and should be granted without a hearing.\nIn the alternative, she requests that a hearing be conducted. /d. She also argues that if a hearing\nis ordered, a broader hearing is required based on a news article that suggests a second juror was\nallegedly a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 48-49.\n\nIn an Opinion & Order filed under <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nmotion for a new trial on the current record.

With regard to Juror 5o’s statements that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations, in order to resolve the motion on this record, the Court would\nhave to accept unsworn statements made to media outlets as true and reach factual\ndeterminations that are not available on the current record.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8993\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6ll Filed o2/24/22 Pagelofl\nGas U.S. Department of Justice\nN27 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Preska\nAugust lo, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nMs. Maxwell requests a <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> stay of the unsealing process for approximately\nthree weeks until the conclusion of (a) the conferral with the U.S. Atorney’s Office to a\nmodification of the Protective Order in the Criminal Action and, if necessary, an application\nand ruling by Judge Nathan on the issue, to permit the use of the information in this Court and\nbefore the Second Circuit (under seal in both courts, if necessary), (b) an application to this\nCourt containing the new information in support of a request to stay the unsealing process\nuntil the conclusion of the Criminal Action, and (c) a ruling by this Court on the motion for\nstay.\n\nStreamlining of Unsealing Process: As directed by the Court, counsel for Ms. Maxwell\nconferred with plaintiff's counsel concerning various proposals to streamline the unsealing\nprocess. Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations applicable to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have l5 pages to object to the\nfive motions proposed belou, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to\nkeep it shorter than that, but also allou for more space to provide specifics to the Court.\n\nSecond, we have obtained new contact information for Doe l from a separate civil\nsuit. We believe that Doe l retains a right to notification and participation.

On July l4, 2o2o, this\nCourt conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial detention was warranted\nbecause the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance at future proceedings. Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if\nthe Court finds “that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool97l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019733.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 3-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll69l, Pagel8 of 2o\nthose materials.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978). As with the\nredactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrouly\ntailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties\npersonal privacy interests.

See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020249.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel5 of 25\nARGUMENT\nThe District Court Properly Denied Maxwell’s Motions for Bail and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Temporary</span> Release\n\n27. Judge Nathan did not clearly err when she determined that\nMaxwell is a risk of flight and that no conditions would reasonably assure her\nappearance in court. Nor did Judge Nathan abuse her discretion or clearly err by\ndenying Maxwell’s request for <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n28. In seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden\nof shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure\nher presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d\n63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\n29. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In\nsuch a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of\npersuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020250.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel6 of 25\nCir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the\nstatutory presumption of detention, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it\nbecomes a factor to be weighed and considered in deciding whether release is\nwarranted. /d.\n\n3o. Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n3l. This Court generally applies “deferential review to a district\ncourt’s order of detention.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir.\n2ol9). It reviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight\nand whether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll);\nUnited States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. l987), and will reverse only if\n“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been commited,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n32. Once a defendant has been ordered detained, a judicial officer\nmay “permit the <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release of the person, in the custody of a United States\nmarshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020251.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel7/ of 25\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l). The defendant bears the burden\nof shouing that <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough,\n82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No. 2o Cr. l26\n(LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o). This Court has not\nresolved whether it reviews a district court’s <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release decision for abuse of\ndiscretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852, 853 n.3\n(2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nl. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Bail\n\n33. Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020254.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying <span class=\"highlight\">Temporary</span> Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020255.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2l of 25\n\n38. At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications. V/d. at 2o n.3). Judge Nathan continued to oversee\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020256.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page22 of 25\nMaxwell’s access to counsel, and Maxwell did not renew her request for <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span>\nrelease in her third bail motion.’\n\n39. Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release is not “necessary” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “<span class=\"highlight\">Temporary</span> release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant. Maxwell has access to a desktop computer provided by the MDC\nand a laptop provided by the Government for Maxwell’s exclusive use to review\ndiscovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A\nat l7-l8). Also during that time, Maxwell has access to email with defense counsel,\ncalls with defense counsel, and legal visits (depending on pandemic-related\nconditions). (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A at l8-l9). Maxwell currently receives\n7 Thus, to the extent Maxwell’s arguments about her ability to prepare for trial are\ntied to any developments since the time of her first bail motion—such as, for\nexample, the imminency of trial (see Br. l7)—this Court need not address such\narguments in the first instance. Cf. United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344 (2d\nCir. 2ooo).\n\n8 In-person visitation at the MDC resumed on or about February l6, 2o2l. Atorney\nvisits are permited seven days per week. (Ex.

(Gov’t Ex.\nA at l8).\n\n4o. Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v. Chambers, No. 2o Cr. l35 (JMF),\n2o2o WL l53o746, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o). Here, that balance emphatically\nfavors detention, given Judge Nathan’s repeated findings about risk of flight and the\nsubstantial accommodations made to ensure Maxwell’s ability to prepare her\ndefense.\n\n4l. The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this conclusion.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex. D at 89-9o; Ex. H at 2l), but she nou\nhas been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at l9, 2l). And while some district courts\nhave ordered <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release based in part on the COVID-l9 pandemic, each of\nthese discretionary decisions rests on its particular facts, as Judge Nathan was well-\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o257\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020258.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page24 of 25\npositioned to note with respect to the principal case cited belou.

(Ex. D). Maxwell twice renewed her bail application (Ex. E, I), which\nmotions Judge Nathan denied in writen orders dated December 28, 2o2o and March\n22,2o2l (Ex.H,L). Maxwell filed notices of appeal from these two orders (though\nnot the original detention order).\n\n4. On April 27, 2o2l, this Court affirmed the orders denying\nMaxwell’s pretrial release that were entered by Judge Nathan on December 28, 2o2o\nand March 22, 2o2l, and denied Maxwell’s motion for bail, or in the alternative,\n<span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> pretrial release pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l).\n\n5.

This Court is already familiar with the factual and procedural\nbackground of this case, which were detailed in the Government’s Affirmation in\nOpposition to Defendant’s Appeal of Orders Denying Pretrial Release, dated April\nl2, 2o2l. The Government respectfully incorporates by reference the facts and\narguments set forth in its April l2, 2o2l opposition.\n\n8.

With respect to eye coverings, Judge Nathan noted that the\nprohibition on eye masks “is a generally applicable policy,” but Maxwell is\nnevertheless permited to “use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes” at\nnight. (Ud. at 2). Judge Nathan concluded that “nothing in the record plausibly\nestablishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her\ntrial and communicate with her lawyers.” (/d.). Consistent with the atention she\nhas paid to Maxwell’s conditions of confinement throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan instructed the Government and the MDC “‘to continue to ensure\nthat Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols” that are “necessary for\nher safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent\nwith the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.” (/d.).\nARGUMENT\nMaxwell’s Motion Should Be Denied\n\n22. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s orders denying\nbail or <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> pretrial release to Maxwell and accordingly denied her motions\nseeking such relief on appeal. The instant motion, which Maxwell styles as a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020372.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel4 of 24\n“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and\ncharacteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\n26. This Court applies “deferential review to a district court’s order\nof detention.” United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d l52, l58 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It\nreviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight and\nwhether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll);\nUnited States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. l987), and will reverse only if\n“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been commited,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.\n\n27.

See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020375.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel7 of 24\nof confinement do not warrant <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release. Nothing in Maxwell’s renewed\nmotion alters that conclusion.\n\n32. “Asa general mater, this Court will adhere to its oun decision\nat an earlier stage of the litigation.” United States v. Plugh, 648 F.3d ll8, l23 (2d\nCir. 2oll). The “law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for\ncompelling reasons,” such as where there is “an intervening change of controlling\nlaw, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent\nmanifest injustice.” Jd. at l23-24; see also United States v. Tenzer, 2l3 F.3d 34,\n39 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We have stated that we will not depart from this sound policy\nabsent cogent or compelling reasons.”). Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason,\nlet alone a “compelling” reason, Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23, for this Court to reverse its\nprior decision.\n\n33. The only new events that Maxwell cites as justification for her\nrequest that this Court reverse itself is additional leter briefing before the District\nCourt regarding MDC’s nightime security checks. Nothing about that briefing or\nJudge Nathan’s most recent writen order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred\nwhen finding Maxwell poses a flight risk or abused her discretion when determining\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release is not warranted.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020378.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\n<span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020380.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page22 of 24\n\n38. The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture\nis whether Judge Nathan commited clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight\nrisk or abused her discretion when denying Maxwell <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> release. Nothing\nin the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s conclusion that Maxwell poses a\nreal risk of flight. Nor does the renewed motion explain hou Judge Nathan’s\ncareful consideration of the MDC’s nightime security protocols and continued\nmonitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with\ncounsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of discretion. Simply\nput, the renewed motion fails to present any “compelling” reason for this Court to\nreverse its prior decision in this case. Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23.\nto review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. 235 at 7 n.4; Dkt. l96 at l-2). Among\nother things, Maxwell has exclusive access to both a desktop and a laptop computer\non which to review her discovery, thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. She\nis also able to review discovery with her atorneys during the 25 hours of legal video-\nteleconference calls she receives each week.

The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29.

(Comey,\nMaurene) (Entered: ll/l9/2o2l)\n\nll/l9/2o2l | 69o | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Before the Court is\nthe Defendant's fourth motion in limine to \"exclude evidence related to Accuser—3,\" to\nwhom the Court refers as Witness—3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of\nEvidence 4o4(b) and 4o3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument\nrelated to this motion, including argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing\nthat was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2. See generally Nov. l, 2o2l\nTranscript; Nov. lo, 2o2l Transcript. At the November l, 2o2l hearing, the Court\nprovided a brief explanation of its current position based on the information then\nbefore it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The\nCourt is nou in receipt of the parties’ additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to\nresolve the motion.(See Footnote l on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The\nGovernment nou proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness—3 will describe\nhou she met the Defendant and her relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein.\nIn particular, Witness—3 is anticipated to testify hou Defendant introduced her to Mr.\nEpstein, hou massages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role\nin facilitating those massages. Based on all of the information nou before the Court,\nincluding a substantially more detailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated\ntestimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43,\nthe Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony may serve as direct\nevidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order\n***].

The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978). As with the\nredactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrouly\ntailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties\npersonal privacy interests.

In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury.

The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

Before the Court is\nthe Defendant's fourth motion in limine to \"exclude evidence related to Accuser—3,\" to\nwhom the Court refers as Witness—3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of\nEvidence 4o4(b) and 4o3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument\nrelated to this motion, including argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing\nthat was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2. See generally Nov. l, 2o2l\nTranscript; Nov. lo, 2o2l Transcript. At the November l, 2o2l hearing, the Court\nprovided a brief explanation of its current position based on the information then\nbefore it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The\nCourt is nou in receipt of the parties’ additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to\nresolve the motion.(See Footnote l on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The\nGovernment nou proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness—3 will describe\nhou she met the Defendant and her relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein.\nIn particular, Witness—3 is anticipated to testify hou Defendant introduced her to Mr.\nEpstein, hou massages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role\nin facilitating those massages. Based on all of the information nou before the Court,\nincluding a substantially more detailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated\ntestimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43,\nthe Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony may serve as direct\nevidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order\n***].

In an Opinion and Order\nconcurrently filed under <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's motion. In\nlight of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that should\nnot be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose\nany redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by\nreference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.

After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and\nOrder should be redacted, the Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pretrial detention continues to be\nwarranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint\nleter indicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such\nproposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

See Dkt. No. l62.\nOn March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions that the\nGovernment had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having considered\nthe parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for\nredactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction requests, with the\nexceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file\nExhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other\nportions are part of the public record. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433, Dkt.\nNo. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees no basis to file the transcript entirely under\nseal rather than by redacting the relevant portions.

No. 22l, under <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> seal with\nproposed redactions. The proposed redactions are GRANTED. The Court's conclusion is\nguided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.\nof Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the weight of the\ncommon law presumption of access to the materials; and (ll) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access.

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of defense lawyers’ clients in other\nmaters and to allou defense counsel to comply with their professional obligations under\nthe rules of professional conduct.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May ll,\n2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n3/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5 minutes at night.\nDkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of her\nrights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nand to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government\ndid not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a\nprotective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES\nMaxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

As explained in the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder, Defendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror\n5o regarding what occurred during jury deliberations that the Court is prohibited from\nconsidering under Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6. With regard to Juror 5o’s statements that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations, in order to resolve the motion on this record, the Court would\nhave to accept unsworn statements made to media outlets as true and reach factual\ndeterminations that are not available on the current record.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021541.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 365 3536o39, Pagell of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l7 of 2l\npublic hearing with input from counsel.

As the bureau, which oversees\nl22 federal prisons and more than l7o,ooo inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with the circumstances\nthat led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer.\n“\\We have put such huge strains on the Burean of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission,\" Hawk Sawyer said before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, “With\nthe dramatic grouth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages, it’s just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last l6\nyears that I've been gone.” The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched,\" she added.\nHawk Sawyer atributed the resouree problem to the rapid increase in the prison population in the last 3o years, employees retiring at a faster rate than they\n. are hired, uncertain budgets, ihe recent government shutdoun andthe hiring [freeze early in the Trump administration. \"We have never had adequate\n__ Pesources to provide all the programs for all the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change nou since you all support the First Step Act.”\nAccording to the hurean's website it currently has 96,348 staff members. The New York Times reported:\nBetween December 2ol6 and September 2ol8 — the date of the most recent data available from the federal Office of Personnel Management — the number of\ncorrectional officers fell more than ll%, from l9,o82 to l6,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend. Before President Doneld Trump tock office, the\nnumber of federal correctional officers had continuously increased: there were l2.5% more officers at the end of 2ol6 compared to the beginning of 2ol2.\nHawk Sawyer said the bureau has “made great progress\" to fill the over 3,3oo vacancies nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff,\nthe bureau is working with the Office of Personnel Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> basis because they are already\n- \" trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online.\nSawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources. She expects the agency will receive\n$75 million in this year’s appropriations for the First Step Act, which the law requires for the first five years, although she hoped for more.

At the time, images from the\nMCC New York's analog video cameras are recorded to a Digital Video\nRecorder (DVR) system, which is divided into two DVR systems. Cameras\nassigned to the DVR l system record only to the DVR l hard drives, and\ncameras assigned to DVR 2 system record only to the DVR 2 hard drives.\n\nMarch l7, 2ol9 In connection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera\nsystem, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office begins arranging for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to perform <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> duty (TDY)\nassignments to MCC New York to perform necessary mechanical,\nelectrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Houever, during the course of the\nTDY rotations, work is not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade\nbecause TDY personnel are sometimes used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts.\n\nJuly 2, 2ol9 According to court records, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York returns an indictment charging\nEpstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.\n\nJuly 6, 2ol9 Epstein is arrested at an airport in New Jersey and is transported for\ndetention pending his initial court appearance to the MCC New York as a\npretrial detainee. Epstein is placed in the general inmate population and\nmedically screened.\n\nJuly 7, 2ol9 An MCC New York Facilities Assistant asks the Psychology Department to\nevaluate Epstein because he appears “distraught, sad, and a litle\nconfused.” Epstein is assigned to the MCC New York's Special Housing\nUnit (SHU) because of significant media atention and his notoriety\namong other MCC New York inmates.”\n\nThe SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the\nsafety of staff and other inmates.\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2338l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023476.jpg": "TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s responsibility to do so. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches\nduring his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023480.jpg": "6. The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5).

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU.

He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrou, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span>\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with\n\nPage 2982\nDOJ-OGR- ooo25376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026893.jpg": "Page 33o4\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nMETROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER, NEW YORK, NY\nDAILY LIEUTENANT’S LOG\n[Shift-Day-Date: M/W Friday, August o9, 2ol9 | Beginning Counts. | savsp>™ |\nDaily Sensitive Information:\nI/M on Suicide Watch w/inmate companion\nI/M peoee =| TCL bed space (SHU)\n| mme | oC ciRononocicaL Evenrs |_| seu |\nl2:oo AM] Lieutenant assumes duties as the Morning Watch —\nOperations Lieutenant.

The wording of :\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at ,\nthe forma] elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child” where the i\nchild is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the child” “with i\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that :\nperson or the child”, CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may '\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a <span class=\"highlight\">temporary</span> or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving j\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare requited to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A, §§ l6-22-lo3, |\nl6-22-lo8.\n\nWith regard to Florida, as you knou, it is reasonably clear that under Florida’s current |\nversion of Megan’s Law, a plea to aggravated assault would not subject the client to registration 5\nin Florida since it is not included among the state’s enumerated “sexual offender” offenses.
