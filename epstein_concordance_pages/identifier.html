Berman\nCase No: l9 CR 49o (RMB)\nPage 3\n\nIl. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\nTailoring.\n\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, § 377l (a)(8)\nand the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 35o9(d)\nprinciples.\n\nWI. Requested Relief\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA 8§ 377l (a)(5), (c)(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo773", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 94 Filed l2/lo/2o Page l of l\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\nUNITED STATES OF AM?\na)\nUSA / Plaintiff(s) )\n\n)\n\nVv. ) Case No.: 2o Cr. 33o\n\n)\n\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL\n\nOT)\n\nDefendant(s) )\n)\n)\nNOTICE OF FILING OF OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT\n\nNotice is hereby given that an official transcript of a conference held on “| l 4/ 2o\nhas been filed by the court reporter/transcriber in the above-captioned mater.\n\nRedaction responsibilities apply to the atorneys of record or pro se parties, even if the person requesting\nthe transcript is a judge or a member of the public or media.\n\nThe parties have seven (7) calendar days from the date of filing of this NOTICE to file with the court\nany NOTICE OF INTENT TO REQUEST REDACTION of this transcript.

Flight Records — Passenger Manifests and Shoppers Travel Records\n\nExactly when the accusers traveled across state lines and when the instances of illegal\nsexual activity took place were critical issues at trial. Not only were these dates relevant for the\njury to assess the accuracy of the witness’ recollections of events that had occurred over 2o years\nago, but they were also important because the accusers needed to be younger than l7 years old\nfor the sexual activity to be illegal under New York law. Contemporaneous flight records would\nhave offered the best possible evidence to shou exactly when accusers traveled. The only such\nrecords admited at trial were the flight logs kept by David Rodgers, which were incomplete and\noften identified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like “l female” or “l\nmale.” Rodgers and Larry Visoski testified that the passenger manifests also contained\ninformation about the names of the passengers on the flights. Tr. l8l9; l7l-73. Because of the\npassage of time, houever, the flight manifests did not go back to the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nOf particular interest were entries in Rodgers’ flight logs which shoued that someone\nwith Jane’s true first name was a passenger on two flights when Jane was l6 years old — one to\nNew York on November ll, l996, and another to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997.\nHouever, because only the first name was listed, the flight logs did not conclusively establish\nthat it was Jane on those flights. Had the passenger manifests been available, the defense could\nhave used them to challenge whether Jane was on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s\nrecollection of events.\n\nSimilarly, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Epstein often had his assistants buy\ncommercial plane tickets for people and that they used a travel service called Shoppers Travel to\nbook them. Tr. 2349.

(Tr. l72). Similarly, Rodgers\ntestified that he turned over the passenger manifests that he completed to one of Epstein’s\natorneys. (Tr. l8l9). The defendant has not established that such manifests were not available\ndue to any intentionally manufactured delay. See United States v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. lo9l,\nlo94 (S.D.N.Y. l973) (“The fact that evidence may be lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment\nstage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the duration.

Requested Relief\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA §§ 377l(a)(5), (c)\\(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data pomts that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\n5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards\ncannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Prech, and the CVRA, deny disclosure\nwithout prejudice.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\n\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\n\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk aud trauma: the\n\npublic platforming of Ms. Maxwell as a purportedly credible commentator despite her sex-trafficking\nconviction and perjury charges, her transfer to louer-security custody, a government request to unseal\n\nfiled without conferral, and the looming specter of clemency.\n\nThese survivors have already endured profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during\n\nthe years of Epsteim’s abuse and in the years follouing.

I was instructed\nby Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media\nrelated material from the residence.\nUpon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as\nthe Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the\nleft side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware siting on floor\nnext to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or\nfeatures indicating a make or model. This CPU was pouered off with\nthe pouer cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the\nCPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,\nprinter, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I\nobserved an A/V card with RCA jacks atached. This type of hardware\nwould allou audio and video to be dounloaded onto the CPU s hard disk.\nThe ends of the RCA jacks were unatached at the time of the search\nand no external camera was located within this room.\nThe CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel\nLCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative\nof a second computer; houever, no other computer was found. It\nappeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the\ncables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same\narea. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,\ni.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is\ncommonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media\nwas found.\n| After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned\nall items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis\nvia a property receipt.\nI was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden\nRoom, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a\nflat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and\nprinter; houever, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed\nfrom an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk\narea revealed no signs of any media devices.\nDet. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana\nroom, which is detached from the residence and located just south of\nthe pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office\ntype seting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,\nkeyboard, mouse and printer; houever, no CPU was located.
