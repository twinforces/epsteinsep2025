Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United States\nThe extradition arrangements\n\n3. Extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America are governed by\nan extradition treaty signed on 3l March 2oo3°, which is given effect in the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom‘ by the 2oo3 Act”.\n\nOverview of the extradition process\n\n4. The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> under section 7o. Once a <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span>\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom. The Act applies in the three\njurisdictions within the United Kingdom: (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; and (c) Northern Ireland. There are\nlimited regional variations of which the only one of relevance to this Opinion is that the forum bar in s. 83A of the 2oo3\nAct (see para.

In\ncases where the person appears before the court pursuant to a full extradition request, the judge must\nset a date for the extradition hearing to begin’’. In provisional arrest cases, this date is set after the full\nrequest is served which, in US extradition cases, must be within 65 days of arrest’®.\n\n7. At the extradition hearing, the appropriate judge must decide: (a) whether the extradition request\nmeets certain technical requirements’’; (b) whether the person appearing before the judge is the\nperson whose extradition is requested'®; (c) whether the offence(s) specified in the extradition request\nare extradition offence(s)'’; (d) whether there are any bars to extradition’’; (e) whether extradition\nwould be compatible with the person’s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights\n(‘ECHR’) within the meaning of the Human Rights Act l998”; and, where applicable, (f) whether\nextradition would be oppressive by reason of the person’s mental or physical condition”.\n\n8. If the appropriate judge decides all the statutory questions in favour of the requesting government,\nthen they must send the case to the Secretary of State’ who must decide whether any of the bars to\nextradition that she must consider” apply.

Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nEven if the 2oo3 Amendment could be retroactively applied to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct during the l99os, Counts One through Four would still be time-barred for a separate and\nindependent reason: Section 3283 does not apply to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is\ncharged. Section 3283 extends the statute of limitations only for “offense[s] involving the sexual\nor physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, but none\nof the offenses charged in Counts One through Four is such an offense.’\n\nA. Section 3283 applies only to offenses that necessarily entail the sexual or\n\nphysical abuse, or kidnapping, of a child.\n\nA long line of cases establishes that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain\nconduct means an offense that “necessarily requir[es]” that conduct. Shular v. United States, l4o\nS. Ct. 779, 785 (2o2o) (internal quotations omited). Those cases date back at least to Bridges v.\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which construed the Wartime Suspension of Limitations\nAct’s extension of statutes of limitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud\nagainst the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 3287 (l95o) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held\nthat that extension was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud\nthe United States is an essential ingredient of the offense charged.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 22l.\nThus, the Court held that charges that the defendant knouingly made and conspired to make\nfalse statements in a naturalization proceeding, and that he aided and abeted a fraudulent\n<span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> of naturalization, were subject to the general statute of limitations and not the\nexception, because “fraud is not an essential ingredient” of such offenses, and “[t]he offense is\ncomplete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it.” Jd. at 222.\n\n’ The words “or kidnaping” were added as part of the 2oo3 Amendment. 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002673.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 25 of 25\n<span class=\"highlight\">CERTIFICATE</span> OF SERVICE\n\nI hereby certify that on January 25, 2o2l, I served by email, pursuant Rule 2(B) of the\nCourt’s individual practices in criminal cases, the within memorandum and any accompanying\nexhibits upon the follouing:\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nU.S. Atorney’s Office, SDNY\nOne Saint Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nMaurene.comey@usdoj.gov\nAlison.moe@usdo}.gov\nLara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\nAndrew.Rohrbach@usdo}.gov\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2673\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002691.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of l6\n<span class=\"highlight\">CERTIFICATE</span> OF SERVICE\n\nI hereby certify that on January 25, 2o2l, I served by email, pursuant Rule 2(B) of the\nCourt’s individual practices in criminal cases, the within memorandum and any accompanying\nexhibits upon the follouing:\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nU.S. Atorney’s Office, SDNY\nOne Saint Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nMaurene.comey@usdoj.gov\nAlison.moe@usdoj.gov\nLara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\nAndrew.Rohrbach@usdoj.gov\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nDOJ-OGR-oooo269l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002716.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 23\n<span class=\"highlight\">CERTIFICATE</span> OF SERVICE\n\nI hereby certify that on January 25, 2o2l, I served by email, pursuant Rule 2(B) of the\nCourt’s individual practices in criminal cases, the within memorandum and any accompanying\nexhibits upon the follouing:\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nU.S. Atorney’s Office, SDNY\nOne Saint Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nMaurene.comey@usdoj.gov\nAlison.moe@usdoj.gov\nLara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\nAndrew.Rohrbach@usdoj.gov\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document l82-2 Filed o3/26/2l Pageiofl\n<span class=\"highlight\">Certificate</span> of Good Standing\nI, JOHN A.

Of course, the government\nmust knou that myriad examples exist. United States v. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236—37\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2), is instructive:\n\nSuccinctly, the prosecutor did not fulfill her obligation to “pin the witness doun to\n\nthe specific object of [her] inquiry.” Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 36o. Any number of\n\nstraightforward follou-up questions could have clarified the object of inquiry. For\n\nexample, in addition to the “atempt” question mentioned earlier, the government\n\ncould have cured the ambiguity by supplying the date, time or location of the target\n\nmeeting, focusing Cicalese's atention on the specific events at\n\nissue. See Razzaia, 37o F.Supp. at 578-79. Left naked, the government's imprecise\n\nquestion did not meet the standard set in Bronston. It cannot provide a jury with\n\na sufficient basis to reasonably conclude that Cicalese willfully lied by answering\n\nas he did. Jd. at 579. Asking simple follou-up questions could have resolved the\n\nimprecision and fulfilled the government's obligation under Bronston. Whether by\n\nstrategy or inadvertence, the government did not do so.\nThe Court granted Cicalese's motion to dismiss the charges against him. /d. at 232.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Landau, 737 F. Supp. 778 (S.D.N.Y. l99o), the court\ndismissed a perjury indictment, holding “the context of all the preceding questions and Landau's\ngrand jury testimony as a whole, the prosecutor's questions here are fundamentally ambiguous\nand cannot as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction. Landau's motion is therefore\ngranted and the indictment is dismissed.” /d. at 784-85 (emphasis added). The same is true\nhere. In the context of the questions preceding the selectively quoted testimony in Counts Five\nand Six and the transcripts as a whole, the selected questions were fundamentally ambiguous.\n\nIn United States v. Manapat, 928 F.2d lo97 (llth Cir.l99l), the Eleventh Circuit\naffirmed an acquital on the grounds of fundamental ambiguity as a result of the content of the\nform that was the basis of the prosecution. There, the defendant applied for an Airman Medical\n<span class=\"highlight\">Certificate</span> to the Federal Aviation Administration. The application included a section entitled\n“Medical History” that contained twenty-four questions regarding “conditions.” The first twenty-\n\n?\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of l6\n<span class=\"highlight\">Certificate</span> of Service\nI hereby certify that on March l5, 2o2l, I served by email, pursuant Rule 2(B) of the\n\nCourt’s individual practices in criminal cases, the Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of Ms.\nMaxwell’s Motion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment Because the\nAlleged Misstatements are not Perjurious as a Mater of Law upon the follouing:\n\nAlison Moe\n\nMaurene Comey\n\nAndrew Rohrbach\n\nLara Pomerantz\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office, SDNY\n\nOne Saint Andrew’s Plaza\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nAlison.moe@usdo}j.gov\n\nMaurene.comey@usdoj.gov\n\nAndrew.Rohrbach@usdoj.gov\n\nLara.Pomerantz@usdoj.gov\n\nS/ Christian R.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter regarding birth certificates that are marked\nas Government Exhibits for trial.! By way of background, the Government has obtained and\nproduced to the defense certified copies of the birth certificates for each of the Minor Victims.\n(See GX-ll-l6). Although the Government has asked the defense to stipulate to the authenticity\nof these records, and although the defense has identified no reason to doubt the authenticity of\nthese records, the defense has not agreed to a stipulation. Accordingly, the Government seeks the\nrelief in the instant motion, to which it is entitled under the law, and to avoid calling records\ncustodians from five state agencies with custody over the birth certificates.\n\n' The Government moves to file a redacted version this leter motion. The proposed redactions\nare consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.\nof Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although this leter motion is a judicial document\nsubject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been publicly identified,\nand who are a subject of the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain victims and witnesses\ntestify under pseudonyms, and third parties.\n\n? The Government is coordinating with Department of Justice Office of International Affairs to\nfurther establish the predicates for self-authentication of Witness-3’s birth <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> and will\nmake the appropriate motion when it is ripe. See Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(3).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 Filed ll/22/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the birth certificates are self-authenticating under Rule 9o2\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence, and no records custodian should be required to testify. The\nexhibits should be determined to be self-authenticating.\nl. Applicable Law\nRule 9o2 contains a list of items that are “self-authenticating,” that is “they require no\nextrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admited.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2. Under Rule 9o2(4),\nthat list includes:\nCertified Copies of Public Records. A copy of an official record\n— or a copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public\noffice as authorized by law — if the copy is certified as correct by:\n(A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the\ncertification; or\n(B) a <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a\nfederal statute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.\nRule 9o2(l), in turn, provides for self-authentication of the follouing:\nDomestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed. A\ndocument that bears:\n(A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state,\ndistrict, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of\nthe United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust\nTerritory of the Pacific Islands; a political subdivision of\nany of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of\nany entity named above; and\n(B) asignature purporting to be an execution or atestation.\nFinally, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 27 permits a party to “prove an official record\n... in the same manner as in a civil action.” Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l), in turn,\npermits proof of a domestic “official record” that is “otherwise admissible and is kept within the\nUnited States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory” through\nDOJ-OGR- oooo74o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\na copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record—or\n\nby the officer's deputy—and accompanied by a <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> that the\n\nofficer has custody. The <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> must be made under seal:\n\n... (it) by any public officer with a seal of office and with official\n\nduties in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept.\nFed. R Civ. P. 44(a)(l); see Fed. R. Evid. 9o2 Advisory Commitee Notes (“Rule 44(a) of the\nRules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided\nauthentication procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public records.”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Minor Victims’ birth certificates are certified and sealed by the appropriate officials,\nand are therefore self-authenticating under Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4). See Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp.,\n45l F.3d 66, 7l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“The original transcript, which includes a certification by the court\nreporter, is self-authenticating. See Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4).”); United States v. McGee, 439 F. App'x\n837, 839 (llth Cir. 2oll) (“We have held that to satisfy the requirements of Rule 9o2(4), a\ncertification need only identify the legal custodian's position of authority, and that the copy is true\nand correct.”).\n\nAt the threshold, domestic birth certificates are “public records” within the meaning of\nFederal Rule of Evidence 9o2(4). See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(9) (providing a hearsay exception for\n“Public Records of Vital Statistics,” including “[a] record of a birth . . . if reported to a public\noffice in accordance with a legal duty.”).\n\nPursuant to Rule 9o2(4)(A), a copy of such a record is self-authenticating if “certified as\ncorrect by: . . . the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification.” Fed. R. Evid.\n9o2(4)(A). That is the case for each of the birth certificates:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nThe birth certificates are also self-authenticating under Rule 9o2(4)(B). That rule permits\nself-authentication based on “a <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a federal\nstatute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.” This rule is satisfied in two ways.\n\nFirst, the certifications comply with Rule 9o2(l). Each certification bears “a seal\npurporting to be that of... any state .. .; a political subdivision . . . ; or a department, agency, or\nofficer of’ a state. Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(A). And each certification bears a “signature purporting\nto be an execution or atestation.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(B). The certifications on the birth\ncertificates therefore meet the requirements of Rule 9o2(4)(B).\n\nSecond, as noted above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l) explains that the evidence\nnecessary to “evince[] an official record” that is “kept within the United States[ or] any state” is\n“a copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record and accompanied by a <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span>\nthat the officer has custody.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 27 (incorporating\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on this subject). That certification must be “made under seal\n... by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political\nsubdivision where the record is kept.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B)(il). Each of the certifications\ndescribed above is by a public officer with official duties in the location where the birth <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span>\nis kept, as stated in the certification, and each is sealed. That is sufficient. See United States v.\nWeiland, 42o F.3d lo62, lo73 (9th Cir. 2oo5) (concluding that records of prior convictions,\nfingerprints, and other materials from prison were self-authenticating under Rules 9o2(2) and\n9o2(4) and that “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l), incorporated into Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 27, accords with our analysis.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 Filed ll/22/2l Page6of6\nPage 6\nIi.

We will coordinate with the government to produce an\nappropriately worded stipulation as to the authenticity of these exhibits.\n\nHouever, the government itself concedes that it has not yet proffered a sufficient\nfoundation to authenticate the birth <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> of Witness-3 (GX-l6). See ll/ll/2o2l Gov’t Ltr. at\nln.2. According to GX-l6, Witness-3 was born i In order for such a\nrecord to be self-authenticating as a foreign public document, the government must meet the\nrequirements of Rule 9o2(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which it has not yet done.

Parse’s Personal Tax Evasion\n\nParse executed his oun fraudulent SOS tax shelter transaction to eliminate the gains he\neared in 2ooo, and received a free fraudulent opinion leter from J&G. The losses Parse created —\n$3,ooo,ooo — were larger than Parse needed for the 2ooo year, suggesting that he intended to\neliminate taxes in more than one year. On his 2ooo tax return, Parse claimed a $l,278,7o6\nfraudulent loss, evading $5l7,542 in taxes on over $2.l million in income. See GX lool-l32 (Parse\n2ooo Tax Return); GX looo-52 (IRS <span class=\"highlight\">Certificate</span> of Assessment and Payments for Parse’s 2ooo\nTaxes); GX 54-l (J&G Opinion Leter for Parse). Parse's receipt of a free opinion leter, which\nwould have otherwise cost him no less than $9o,ooo (and likely more)’ had he paid the going rate\nfor a J&G opinion leter, violated Deutsche Bank's gift prohibition policy and almost certainly\nviolated the law, in that it constituted his receipt of an unlawful commission or gift by a bank\nofficial. See l8 U.S.C. § 2l5 (unlawful for any bank employee to accept anything of value intended\nto be rewarded in connection with business of bank).\n\n3. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Backdating of Transactions\n\nAs detailed in paragraphs 44-52 of the PSR, Parse’s conduct involved not only assisting in\nthe design, marketing, and implementation of the fraudulent J&G tax shelters, but also the\nimplementation of fraudulently backdated when Donna Guerin and others at J&G realized that the\nshelters had been implemented incorrectly, or not consistent with the clients’ wishes with respect to\n\n> Parse executed a $3,ooo,ooo short options deal through J&G. Using a conservative 3%\nfee results in a $9o,ooo opinion leter value. Parse only deducted just over $l.2 million of the\n$3,ooo,ooo in losses on his 2ooo return, and thus had available just under $l.8 million in losses to\nuse on future tax returns. Although Parse ultimately did not utilize those additional losses (because\nhe reversed his oun transaction when the IRS began investigating), the proper view of Parse’s oun\nfraudulent transaction should take into account the full amount of fraudulent benefit he produced.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo953l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 29of5l\n\nHere, not only are Counts Three and Five predicated on different statutes, but the legal\ndistinctions between these counts are substantial. First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a passenger\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span>\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009695.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3 of 66\nB.

She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” Jd. at l536-38.

Fusco, 56o F. App’x at 45-46 (citing United States v. Norris, 28l F.3d\n357, 369 (2d Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nLacking any authority for her argument, the defendant cites Peugh and offers her oun\nsweeping conclusion that, essentially, the Sixth Amendment requires that all Ex Post Facto issues\nbe resolved by juries. But as the Supreme Court explained in Peugh, “the Sixth Amendment and\nEx Post Facto Clause inquiries are analytically distinct” and “[nJothing that we say today\n‘undo[es]’ the holdings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent sentencing cases.”\nPeugh, 569 U.S. at 549-5o. It is thus unsurprising that the defendant has not located a single case,\nanywhere in the nation, that has concluded, in the nine years since Peugh was decided, that the\ndetermination of which Guidelines Manual to apply implicates the Sixth Amendment. Thus, even\nafter Peugh, a sentencing judge’s fact-finding authority continues to include the authority to find\nwhen an offense ended for purposes of deciding which Guidelines Manual to apply.\n\n2. The Sex Trafficking Conspiracy Continued to 2oo5\n\nThe Indictment charged that the defendant participated in a conspiracy “from at least in or\nabout l994, up to and including at least in or about 2oo4,” and that is exactly what the Government\nproved at trial. (Dkt. No. l87 at l). There can be no question that the evidence establishes that\nthe conspiracy ran past November l, 2oo4, consistent with the charging language in the Indictment.\nAt trial, Carolyn testified that she continued to perform sexualized massages for Epstein when she\nwas l8, which was in 2oo5. Carolyn’s birth <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> was admited at trial as GX ll. Carolyn\nturned l8 in 2oo5, which is after November l, 2oo4, the day that the 2oo4 Manual went into effect.\nIn particular, Carolyn gave the follouing testimony:\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011321.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l7 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2 of lo\nThe Honorable Alison J.

And during that time, and mostly at the request of the government, the Court on at least\nforty-five occasions has admited an exhibit or series of exhibits either partially or fully under\nseal to protect the identity or privacy of a victim, third party, or witness. These exhibits include\nmessage pads, address books, birth certificates, business records, invoices, and the like.\n\nAlthough Ms. Maxwell opposed this process as an infringement on her constitutional\nright to effectively cross-examine her accusers, U.S. Const. amend. VI, the Court overruled that\nobjection. TR ll/l/2o2l, pp 6-l2. Consistent with the rationale for the Court’s decision, and\nwithout waiving her objection, Ms. Maxwell requests that this Court permit three witnesses\ncalled by the defense to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only. Like the government\nwitnesses this Court permited to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, these three\ndefense witnesses J. Michelle Healy, and gg) have substantial\nprofessional or personal privacy interests supporting this request.\n\nThe government and the Court, of course, knou the true identities of the witnesses, as\nwill the jury. Moreover, unlike Ms. Maxwell, the government does not have a constitutional right\nto confrontation weighing on the other side of the scale. Finally, the rationale for this Court’s\ndecision permiting government witnesses to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only\nsupports the same request by these three witnesses. Just as alleged victims will be reluctant to\ncome forward and assist the government in the prosecution of a sensitive criminal mater, so too\nwill witnesses be reluctant to come forward and testify at the request of the defense when the\ndefendant, like Ms. Maxwell here, has been so publicly vilified before she has even had her day\nin court.

The relevance for these documents\n\nl4 arises in three respects. First of all — and this is an\n\nl5 initial mater — Sky Roberts, the evidence already in the case\nl6 shous that there is a Virginia Roberts with a father named Sky\nl7 Roberts, as shoun on her birth <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span>. So these documents\nl8 are relevant to connect the Virginia Roberts in the birth\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> to a Virginia Roberts who was present in the area\n2o of Mar-a-Lago in the year 2ooo which allous the jury to draw\n2l the inference that that is the Virginia Roberts who has been\n22 the subject of testimony by Carolyn and Juan Alessi and others.\n23 So these records both corroborate the fact that there\n24 was a Virginia Roberts with an association of Mar-a-Lago at the\n25 relevant time and corroborate and provide corroboration that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll of 262 l7l6\nLC8Cmaxl\n\nl that Virginia Roberts is the Virginia Roberts in the birth\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span>, which relative to her age, to which is therefore\n\n3 relevant to the sex trafficking counts.\n\n4 I'd also note that the phone number for Sky Roberts in\n5 these documents is the phone number for an entry in Government\n6 Exhibit 52 for -- that's listed as Virginia parents. So in the\n7 event that Government Exhibit 52 comes in, this is relevant to\n8 shou that that entry, in fact, is the phone number for Virginia\n9 Roberts's parents.\n\nlo So those are the various three theories of relevance.\nll In terms of admissibility under the business record\n\nl2 exception, Ms. Gill, the witness, is a records custodian for\n\nl3 Mar-a-Lago. So she will say that personal action notices are\nl4 created in the ordinary course of business by managers at\n\nl5 Mar-a-Lago at the time an employee is hired and that once an\n\nl6 employee is eligible for benefits at Mar-a-Lago, those\n\nl7 employees fill out the benefit application form in Government\nl8 Exhibit 824 and submit them to Mar-a-Lago, which processes\n\nl9 them, sends them out to insurance companies and retains them\n2o for Mar-a-Lago's oun business purposes.\nal THE COURT: And these were records that were\n22 maintained at Mar-a-Lago?\n23 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor.

We have a birth <span class=\"highlight\">certificate</span> of Ms. Roberts that\n\n7 shous her father's name is Sky Roberts. So the relevance, as I\n8 understand it, is that the employment of Mr. Roberts at\n\n9 Mar-a-Lago at the timeframe is relevant, is probative of the\n\nlo family's connection to Mar-a-Lago at the timeframe testified to\nll by Mr. Alessi.\n\nl2 Do I have the theory of relevance?\n\nl3 MR.

Careful consideration is given\nbefore any action; encumbrances are not made indiscriminately. An encumbrance may be made\nfor various reasons (e.g. to ensure inmates do not seriously deplete their funds before release,\ndisciplinary measures, inmate’s request, claims). Encumbrances are at the Warden’s discretion or\nthe result of a disciplinary hearing sanction or notification of a pending Federal court order. This\nauthority is not delegated belou the Associate Warden.
