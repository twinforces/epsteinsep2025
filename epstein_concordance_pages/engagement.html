But it is entirely unclear hou the fact that the Farmers are\nrepresented by BSF and the dates of the <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> leter could possibly be exculpatory, and the\nDefendant does not atempt to explain that proposition.\n\nNor are the <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> leters relevant to any of the Defendant’s pretrial motions. The\nDefendant’s motions to suppress appear to be based on a theory that the Government improperly\nobtained evidence from BSF while it was representing Virginia Giuffre (not the Farmers) in\nGiuffre v. Maxwell. ECF Nos. l34, l4o. The only relevance of Annie Farmer to the Defendant’s\nmotion for dismissal based on pre-indictment delay appears to be based on Maxwell’s statement\nthat Ms. Farmer was interviewed by the FBI in 2oo6. ECF No. l38 at 2. But the Defendant has\nnot explained hou an <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> leter between Annie Farmer and BSF is of any consequence to\nher theory. The Defendant also points out in her motion for dismissal based on pre-indictment\ndelay that Annie Farmer may have cooperated with the Government in the criminal investigation\nof her abuser—an unremarkable proposition. /d. at l8. Not only is it unclear hou this theory\nsupports the Defendant’s arguments about pre-indictment delay, but the Defendant again has not\nexplained hou an <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> leter with BSF is relevant to this theory.\n\nAs to Maria Farmer, she is only relevant to the motion for dismissal based on\npre-indictment delay insofar as the Defendant argues that the Government knew about the\nallegations against the Defendant when Maria Farmer reported them to the NYPD years ago.

Again, houever, the Defendant does not explain why Maria Farmer’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> leter with BSF is relevant to support this proposition or is otherwise relevant to the\nmotion. The Defendant’s conclusory arguments that the <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> leters between BSF and the\nFarmers are relevant to something other impeachment are unpersuasive and demonstrate that she\ncannot clear Nixon’s relevance hurdle as to Requests 6 and 7.\nIll. Request 8: Grand Jury Subpoena to BSF\n\nRequest 8 fails for the same reason that Requests l and 2 fail. If the Defendant is entitled\nto this information, then she must obtain it from the Government. And if she is not entitled to this\ninformation, she cannot use Rule l7 to circumvent Rule l6’s limitations. See supra Part I.C.\n\nIV. Request 9: Annie Farmer’s Journal®\n\nAs to the Defendant’s request for an original copy of Annie Farmer’s entire journal from\nwhen she was a teenager, the Defendant contends that the journal is exculpatory because the\nrelevant passages do not mention the Defendant—but this is information that she already has, and\nshe does not explain why she needs the entire journal prior to trial if she already has the allegedly\nexculpatory information in the journal. The Defendant already has copies of all of the relevant\npages of the journal. She does not explain why she needs to inspect the entire journal “to establish\nwhether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoliation has occurred.” Resp.\nLtr. at 9. This purported need to inspect the journal for authenticity would carry more weight if\nthe journal was inculpatory, and thus she sought to examine the authenticity of the pages containing\nallegations against her, but she contends it is instead exculpatory. If the Defendant seriously\ncontends that the journal is relevant because it is exculpatory, and that it is exculpatory because\n° BSF also points the Court to the objections that Ms. Farmer has herself posed in response\nto the Defendant’s proposed Rule l7 subpoena to her, in which the Defendant requests the same\njournal from Ms. Farmer.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4oll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page4of9\nSee United States v.

On the specificity prong alone, Requests | through 5 fail to satisfy\nthe Nixon standard.\n\nRequests l and 2 fail for the separate reason that, if Maxwell is entitled to the materials\nsought at all, they should come from the Government. Requests l, 2, and 8 all seek documents\nthat are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests l and 2 seek\ncommunications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2ol5\nto the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that\nthe Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena is necessary to fix what she deems to be the Government’s failure to comply with its\ndiscovery obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be\notherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 4l8\nU.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the\nhands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government\nhas not met its discovery obligations, the Rule l7(c) subpoena process is not the proper\nmechanism for pursuing that. Rather, with notice to the Government so that the issue is properly\njoined, Maxwell must make some shouing of that failure and seek specific and appropriate relief\nfrom this Court.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> leters between BSF\nand two of its clients who are alleged victims. Maxwell has failed to make the required shouing\nunder Nixon that these records would be relevant or admissible for purposes of her Rule l7(c)\napplication.

But as a general mater, the need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol.

See also\nAvenati, 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (rejecting the argument that the defendant needed the recordings\nin question prior to trial in order “to demonstrate witnesses’ bias or self-interest.”). The\narguments as to relevance are otherwise specious, and the Court cannot discern what relevance\nthe materials responsive to Requests 6 and 7 may have. In any event, there is litle risk that\nreview of these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial,\ngiven their limited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467, 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). For documents that may ripen into relevance if and when the BSF\nclients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require\nproduction of the <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> leters to the Court so that the information can be made available\nto Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness’s direct testimony.

United States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4-CR-l86 (SCR), 2oo8 WL\n9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2oo8).\n\nTo determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the\nfactors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo. To clear that hurdle,\nthe Court considers (l) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. /d. at 7oo.\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nOn April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l, the Court denied Maxwell’s request for an order\nauthorizing issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Boies, Schiller, Flexner LLP. See Dkt. Nos.\n252, 298. In doing so, the Court noted that the requests contained in that proposed subpoena all\nfailed the Nixon test. The proposed subpoenas to these four individuals seek similar materials,\nand the subpoenas fail for similar reasons.\n\nA. Subpoena Recipient-l\n\nThe Court begins with the proposed subpoenas to Subpoena Recipient-l. The proposed\nsubpoena to her makes five requests which overlap entirely with requests contained in the\nproposed subpoena to BSF. Specifically, Maxwell requests (l) any contingent fee and\n<span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> agreements between Subpoena Recipient-land any atorneys; (2) Subpoena\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005032.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page3oflo\nRecipient-l’s original journal for inspection and copying; (3) a pair of black boots that Maxwell\nand Jeffrey Epstein allegedly gave to Subpoena Recipient-l; (4) production of the original copies\nof certain photographs of Subpoena Recipient-l; and (5) materials related to the Epstein Victim\nCompensation Fund. As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.\n\nThe request for any contingent or <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> agreements fails because Maxwell has not\nmade the required shouing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only\nplausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary\nfor purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 4-5. The need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment\nmaterial does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.\nl5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of relevance to these\nmaterials—and Maxwell does not advance any explanation, other than impeachment, as to why\nthese materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any relevance or admissibility,\nthe request is improper for purposes of Rule l7(c). In any event, there is litle risk that review of\nthese materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their\nlimited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467 (ALC), 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). Ifthe materials become relevant at trial, Maxwell will be able to\nprocure them at that time.\n\nMaxwell’s request for production of Subpoena Recipient-l’s journal also fails the Nixon\ntest. As the Court noted in its June 2, 2o2l opinion, the original and complete journal is not the\nproper subject of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. As already noted, mere impeachment purposes do not\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page6oflo\n\nB. Subpoena Recipient-2\n\nThe proposed subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-2 contains four requests. The first seeks\nany contingent fee and <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> agreements between Subpoena Recipient-2 and any\natorneys; the second seeks an envelope that allegedly has Epstein’s and Maxwell’s “touch\nDNA”; the third seeks certain physical evidence, including photographs, old diaries, and\ntelephone books; and the fourth seeks EVCP materials. The first and fourth requests fail for the\nsame reasons as discussed above; their only plausible theory of relevance is impeachment, which\nplaces them outside the proper scope of Rule l7(c).\n\nThe second and third requests are plainly sought for impeachment purposes. Indeed,\nMaxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks production of the envelope in order to “disprove”\nclaims that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial if called to testify. Beyond a conclusory\nassertion regarding Subpoena Recipient-2, houever, Maxwell does not make any effort to\nidentify which claims she seeks to disprove. Nor does she explain why the envelope, or any\ninformation derived from its inspection, is relevant to the criminal charges she is facing. At\nmost, that is, she seeks the envelope in order to impeach any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-\n2 might have if called to testify. The request is speculative and clearly beyond the proper scope\nof Rule l7(c).\n\nThe third request, for vast amounts of physical evidence that Subpoena Recipient-2\nshoued or produced to Subpoena Recipient-3, fails for two reasons. The first is relevance; as\nabove, Maxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks to examine the evidence in order to prepare\nto rebut any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial (or any evidence\nintroduced through Subpoena Recipient-2). Here, too, the request seeks to impeach Subpoena\nRecipient-2’s potential testimony. That is insufficient. Other than that, Maxwell makes no effort\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005057.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 5 of 6o\nATTACHMENT A\nDEFINITIONS\n\nl. “You” or “Your” means Annie Farmer.\n\n2. “Journal” means the spiral notebook depicted in Exhibit A to this Atachment A.\n\n3. “Black Boots” means the footwear depicted in Exhibit B to this Atachment A.\n\n4. “Photographs” means the original developed film photographs, any negatives reflecting these\nphotographs, and any digital images of those photographs, all produced in the Annie Farmer\nv.

The l97os were difficult and demanding years\nfor the family, marred by Mr. Maxwell’s endless batle of lawsuits and financial ruin.

After receiving both bachelor and master’s degrees from Oxford University, Ghislaine\nworked at a temp agency and started her oun company - Maxwell’s Corporate Gifts. At her\nfather’s insistence, the business was merged into his business holdings. By l99l, Ghislaine had\nrelocated to New York to launch The European, an international magazine, as part of the Maxwell\npublishing conglomerate.

BOP values OIG's careful review of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the\nrecommendations resulting from this <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span>. The lessons learned during the course of this\n<span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span> will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.\nThe facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this\nreport reflect a failure to follou BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While\nthis misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very\nsmall percentage of the approximately 35,ooo employees across more than l2o institutions who\ncontinue to strive for correctional excellence every day.\nIn the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve\naccountability. In response to this and previous OIG and Government Accountability Office\n(GAO) engagements, BOP has already begun to evaluate nationwide trends and strengthen\nemployee accountability.\n\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023484.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 3 of 3\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate\nwhereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when\nconducting a round.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address\nstaffing shortages at its prisons.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Hiring and retaining qualified\npersonnel is a key priority and BOP has developed and implemented a multi-pronged approach\nthat involves enhanced recruitment efforts and appropriate incentives. While the issues raised in\nthe OIG’s report were the result of employees failing to adhere to their duties, as opposed to a\nstaffing shortage, the BOP welcomes the opportunity to continue the significant work that has\nalready been undertaken and that is ongoing regarding staffing.\nRecommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes\nas may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional\nsecurity camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the\ncapacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nThe BOP appreciates OIG’s careful atention to this <span class=\"highlight\">engagement</span>, and its willingness to provide\nspecific, feasible recommendations that address the root causes of issues raised in the incident\ndescribed.
