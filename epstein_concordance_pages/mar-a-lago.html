In addition to strong legal defenses Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was\nexceptional. It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of Giuffre’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action. Very quickly there were\nmany provable “obvious lies.” A few examples:\n\ne Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her\nfiance long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell and held a number of jobs in 2ool\nand 2oo2.\n\ne Giuffre’s employment at the <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span> spa began in fall 2ooo when she was l7, not l5.\n(This falsity was important to Giuffre’s story for many reasons.)\n\ne Palm Beach Police investigation revealed no evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in\nsexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or possession of child\npornography.\n\ne No nude photograph of Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’s home.\n\ne Giuffre’s tales about foreign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.\n\ne All ofthe famous people Giuffre claimed to have been sexually trafficked to denied these\nclaims, which were completely implausible.\n\nImportantly, Giuffre post-dates the allegations contained in the superseding indictment\n(“Indictment”) by three years. By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong connection with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries. The parties disagreed about the scope and\nmeaning of virtually all of Judge Sweet’s discovery orders, including those related to Ms.\nMaxwell’s depositions. Significantly, Judge Sweet’s Order prefaced all the listed categories with\nthe words “sexual activity” an “sexual activities.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document593 _ Filed o2/o4/22 CORAGEEISIRY # 4\nDATE: {i file/2/\nSa eae ee\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT CASE: “Oe $5o |\n: SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell, . |\nLocations and Entities for\nDefendant.

(/d.).\n\n4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts\n\nBeginning in or about the summer of 2ooo, the defendant and Epstein entered a new phase\nof their scheme to sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Maxwell recruited a l7-year-old\ngirl named Virginia Roberts from the parking lot of <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span> to provide Epstein with massages.\n(PSR § 56). Over the next several months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with sexualized\nmassages at his Palm Beach residence, in exchange for hundreds of dollars in cash for each\nmassage. (PSR § 55). Virginia also traveled with Epstein and Maxwell to other locations,\nincluding New York and the Virgin Islands, on Epstein’s private plane. (PSR 457). Virginia\nbrought other teenage girls to Epstein’s Palm Beach house. (PSR 458). One of those girls was a\nl4-year-old girl named Carolyn who Virginia introduced to the defendant and Epstein at the Palm\nBeach villa in 2ool. (PSR ff 58, 59). Thus began the pyramid scheme phase of the defendant and\nEpstein’s abuse of teenage girls.\n\n5. Sexual Abuse of Carolyn\n\nCarolyn visited Epstein’s Palm Beach residence more than loo times, during each of which\nshe was sexually abused during paid sexualized massages. (PSR 59). Carolyn met the defendant\nthe very first time she went to Epstein’s house, and she interacted with the defendant multiple\ntimes thereafter. (/d.). On Carolyn’s first visit to the house, the defendant greeted Virginia, who\nintroduced Carolyn to the defendant. (PSR { 62). The defendant then told Virginia, “You can\nbring her upstairs and shou her what to do,” after which Virginia shoued Carolyn hou to perform\na sexual massage on Epstein. (PSR {| 62-63). Carolyn performed over loo paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein when she was between l4 and l8 years old. (PSR ¥ 64).

The fact that they provided -- that they sent this\n\n5 form and then insurance was provided based on the employee's\n\n6 information, that's the out-of-court statement.

The case is about an\n\n8 outsider to the hotel filling out a form or -- the case said it\n9 wouldn't mater if the employee filled it out themselves.\n\nlo Verification is important there because they are just\nll taking the information of the outsider at their word. Here,\n\nl2 Mr. Roberts was an employee of <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span>; so he had a business\nl3 duty not to lie to his oun employer.

So these documents\nl8 are relevant to connect the Virginia Roberts in the birth\n\nl9 certificate to a Virginia Roberts who was present in the area\n2o of <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span> in the year 2ooo which allous the jury to draw\n2l the inference that that is the Virginia Roberts who has been\n22 the subject of testimony by Carolyn and Juan Alessi and others.\n23 So these records both corroborate the fact that there\n24 was a Virginia Roberts with an association of <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span> at the\n25 relevant time and corroborate and provide corroboration that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll of 262 l7l6\nLC8Cmaxl\n\nl that Virginia Roberts is the Virginia Roberts in the birth\n\n2 certificate, which relative to her age, to which is therefore\n\n3 relevant to the sex trafficking counts.\n\n4 I'd also note that the phone number for Sky Roberts in\n5 these documents is the phone number for an entry in Government\n6 Exhibit 52 for -- that's listed as Virginia parents.

I think the\n\n3 question is, did they do anything to verify the information on\n4 the form. The fact that they provided -- that they sent this\n\n5 form and then insurance was provided based on the employee's\n\n6 information, that's the out-of-court statement. It's\n\n7 Mr. Roberts' statement on this form that you're seeking to\n\n8 offer for the truth. So unless there is -- you'll look at the\n9 Lieberman case. I think it's directly on point, as I said.\n\nlo MR. ROHRBACH: I'm happy to look at the case and also\nll ask Ms. Gill, your Honor.\n\nl2 My point is, I think it's more than just sending the\nl3 form and then obtaining insurance for someone because their\n\nl4 name is on the form, but it's the course of conduct of paying\nl5 bills for someone who then receives medical treatment because\nl6 that person is insured through <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span>.\n\nl7 THE COURT: Well, if she's got information on this\n\nl8 emoloyee with respect to that or records, I suppose that's\n\nl9 another story.\n2o MR.

I think she would likely say that the <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span>\n\n4 does not make independent efforts to verify information on\n\n5 these forms.\n\n6 I've also been reading United States v.

The case is about an\n\n8 outsider to the hotel filling out a form or -- the case said it\n9 wouldn't mater if the employee filled it out themselves.\n\nlo Verification is important there because they are just\nll taking the information of the outsider at their word. Here,\n\nl2 Mr. Roberts was an employee of <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span>; so he had a business\nl3 duty not to lie to his oun employer. So he's not an outsider\nl4 in the traditional sense the way that United States v.\n\nl5 Lieberman and cases like it are talking about.

It's a point of distinction, but it\nal doesn't shou verification.\n22 Do you have authority for beyond verification, some\n23 obligation to fill it out truthfully or the like?

Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into\ntrouble Aged ll, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.\nLiving cn the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘Twas a\npaedophile’s dream, she says.\nThree years jater, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved\nto Palm Beach,\nFlorida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump’s country club, <span class=\"highlight\">Mar-a-Lago</span>.\n|\nVirginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her l5th birthday, |\nshe met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.\n‘l was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top - when I was approached by |\nGhislaine,’ Virginia says.\nl\n‘| told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman who i\nwas looking for a travelling masseuse.\nI'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being\nhanded the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. .\nHe drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also ouns a nine-storey home\nin New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,5oo-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and :\nLitle Saint James, a private 7o- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands.\na ; o3956-l277\nhtp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie... 3/l6/Zoll\n DOG=OGR-ooo29o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032615.jpg": ", > Colonizk.
