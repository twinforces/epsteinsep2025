Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cleveland</span>, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel. The \"federal\" practice of\n\nalmost exclusive voir dire examination by the Court does not take\n2 Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving “Its Wonderful Pouer”, 27 Stan. L.
