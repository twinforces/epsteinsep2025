Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial <span class=\"highlight\">collection</span> of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants.

P. l7 subpoena is neither\naccurate nor informative. The <span class=\"highlight\">collection</span> of various cliche phrases about Rule l7 subpoenas,\nselectively gathered from cases inapplicable here, is unpersuasive, and the Court should deny\nthe requested relief because: (l) the government lacks standing to interfere with subpoenas\nissued to the third party respondents; and (2) this intrusion is yet another atempt to infringe\non Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, a fair trial, and due\nprocess, all in violation of the 5“ and 6\" Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nI. Background\n\nIn February 2ol6 (and likely at least one other time in the weeks and months that\nfolloued), lawyers representing numerous civil litigants, including then-Plaintiff Virginia\nGiuffre, met with the government to foment an indictment of Ms. Maxwell. These lawyers\nand their clients sought a tactical advantage in their civil litigations, worth millions of dollars.\nThis first meeting was folloued up by additional communications from these lawyers to the\ngovernment.

The Prosecution Team’s Files\n\nAs the Court is aware, the charges in this case arose from an investigation opened in 2ol8\nand conducted by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\n(“SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York\nPolice Department (“NYPD”; collectively, the “Prosecution Team”). (Dkt. No. 63 at l). The\nGovernment has obtained the full investigative file from the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident Agency\n(the “FBI Florida Office”), which conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein between 2oo5 and 2olo (the “FBI Florida File”), and whose file also contained the\ninvestigative file for the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) related to that same\ninvestigation (the “Florida Investigation”). The Government has reviewed and produced all Rule\nl6 materials, including potential Brady material, contained within the Prosecution Team’s Files,\nincluding the FBI Florida File and the PBPD file. The Government has not identified anything\nwithin the files of the Prosecution Team, the FBI Florida File, or the PBPD file that constitutes\nBrady material with respect to the NPA.\n\nC. The Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">Collection</span> and Review of Other Agencies’ Files\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the Government submited a leter to the Court seting forth its plan\nfor collecting and reviewing certain files from other agencies with potential relevance to this case.\n(Dkt. No. 63). Although Second Circuit law did not require the Government to do so because\nthose other agencies were not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government endeavored to collect\nand review certain of those materials as part of its commitment to go above and beyond its\ndisclosure obligations. (/d. at 4). In particular, the Government noted its intention to collect: (l)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3957", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l9 of 26\n\ntime the defendant was indicted in July 2o2o or at the time Jeffrey Epstein was indicted in 2ol9.\nSpecifically, although Minor Victim-4 had previously been interviewed once in or about 2oo7 in\nconnection with a prior investigation conducted by the USAO-SDFL, Minor Victim-4 did not\nagree to be interviewed by the prosecution team handling this case until July 2o2o.

The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">collection</span> and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def.

The Government intends to\ncall live witnesses to establish the authenticity of the evidence at trial.'®\n\nThird, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 25l and 288 are\n'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was writen by both Detective Recarey\nand another witness who is expected to testify at trial.

Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata <span class=\"highlight\">collection</span> CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5oflil\nidentified a blonde woman as being at the residence.

No. 2o4 at 4l-59), and in its memorandum in\nopposition to the defendant’s supplemental motions, dated May 2l, 2o2l (Dkt. No. 295 at l3-l6),\nthe Indictments in this case were brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">collection</span> of\nevidence to support the charges. Any suggestion that the Government intentionally delayed\nobtaining the Indictments to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in fact, and for good\nreason: itis not true. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay,\nmuch less an intentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nIn her current motion, the defendant offers no additional argument or factual claims\nwhatsoever in support of her argument that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-\nindictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. Indeed, she\nignores the second prong of the pre-indictment delay standard and refers the Court back to her\nprior briefing, which this Court has twice considered and rejected. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7; Dkt. No.\n3l7 at lo). If anything, the trial record undermined the defendant’s argument on this prong. In an\neffort to shou the victims’ supposed financial motivations for testifying, the defendant repeatedly\nfocused the jury’s atention on the fact that victims only recently agreed to cooperate with the\nGovernment. That same evidence precludes any argument of intentional delay by the Government.\nThe defendant’s renewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon\npre-indictment delay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009959.jpg": "acaiaeesamemaddiadalinemma is. 7s FRIES OB EO7P ab ditheg & S56 cf 767\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, y\n\nPAUL M.

Suicide Response\nRecognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and\ninmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that\n“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC\nNew York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.\nThese orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the\nsituation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be\ntaken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff\nbelieve that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy\ngoverning crime scenes and the <span class=\"highlight\">collection</span> of evidence provides that the need to immediately atend to an\napparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence\nover efforts to preserve a crime scene.\"?\n5. Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act. At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permited to\nl3 BOP Program Statement 55lo.l4, Crime Scene Management and Evidence Control, is a restricted policy that is not\nreleased to the public in its entirety.\n4 BOP Elements of Prohibited Acts.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023654.jpg": "Funds found in an institution that cannot be atributed to a specific inmate are delivered to the\nAccounting Section and deposited in accordance with the Program Statement Imprest Funds,\nCollections, and Deposits.\n8.7 MANAGEMENT OF DECEASED INMATES’ FUNDS\nIf an inmate dies with funds remaining in his/her Inmate Deposit account, that money should be\ndistributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution in the relevant state.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims.

I\nwas previously told that the Chief Judge had extended the filing\ndeadlines due to the hurricane and the Courthouse being closed. On\nOctober 27, and 28, 2oo5 the courthouse was closed and I could not\nfile the search warrant and inventory at the clerk's office. On\nOctober 3l, 2oo5, I responded to the courthouse and filed the\n| paperwork along with an order to seal, signed by Judge Johnson, to\n| deny any release of any paperwork on this case.\nINV CONTINUES...\nERK KEKE KKEKEEKEKKEKKEKKKKKEKEK N A R RATIV E # LR BRK KRKEKKRKKKEKEKEKEKEEKEKEKEKEKKEEEEE\n4 Reported By: PARKINSON, GREGORY A. lo/2o/o5\nEntered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. ll/o7/o5\nOn October 2o, 2oo5, at approximately 8:3o a.m., Thursday morning, I\nwas advised by Captain Gudger that a search warrant would be executed\nand that I was to assemble the Crime Scene Investigative Team and\nstand by the south side of the building ready to go. I designated\nEvidence Specialist Annete Badger to handle the inventory return, the\ndocumentation of the property receipts and the <span class=\"highlight\">collection</span> and bagging\nof the evidence at the scene. I further instructed CSI Kim Pavlik, ID\n# 88o7, to accompany us and perform the role of photographing the\nscene and the items that may be taken into custody by the affiant,\nDetective Joseph Recarey, ID # 79l5.\nMy responsibility was to go through from the reading of the warrant to\nthe final exit from the residence and perform a video recording of the\nreading of the warrant, the initial walk through of the residence\nshouing the current condition and then finally a walk through of the\nresidence at the time of the police exit.\nWe started out touards the residence, which was located at 358 El\nBrillo and arrived at approximately 9:33 a.m. The search was\nconducted, items were collected by Evidence Specialists Badger,\no7/26/l7 Page 2566 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32879"};
