The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”*?? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”*°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... I am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\ncoordinate hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.

Although the government\n“produced” the materials to defense counsel on April l3, 2o2l, as of today’s date, Ms. Maxwell\nstill has not yet received this discovery and has not been able to review it personally and with her\ncounsel. The government has represented that it sent a CD with the materials to the MDC the\nsame it was produced to defense counsel. Defense counsel also delivered a hard drive to the\ngovernment on April l3, 2o2l to load the materials so that Ms. Maxwell could review the\nmaterials on the laptop, which does not have a CD drive. Ms. Maxwell has received neither.\n\nThe government claimed that the hard-drive took several days to load, and that it currently is\n<span class=\"highlight\">somewhere</span> in the mailroom at MDC. With less than 9o days before trial, the inability for Ms.\nMaxwell to review more than 2o,ooo pages of largely exculpatory material presents a significant\nimpediment to her trial preparation.\n\nDefense counsel anticipate that simply reading the material and discussing it with Ms.\nMaxwell (who still does not have the information) will take will take weeks. Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof access to the information (actual and logistical) combined with the age of the allegations and\nMaxwell lacked knouledge of Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme, were only produced to her\ncounsel (and not her) on April l3, 2o2l. As the Brady order specifies, continuance is a remedy.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3994", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 98 of 349\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” <span class=\"highlight\">somewhere</span>, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.'!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4395", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l39 of 349\n\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes, 78\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last! Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.’ The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be <span class=\"highlight\">somewhere</span> ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months. He should be spending l8 years in jail.”\n\nAcosta later publicly stated that the FBI Special Agent in Charge called him “to offer\ncongratulations” and “to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes of Messrs.

September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.””°’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOJA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”””° Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy. The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”°°? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”*°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... J am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\ncoordinate hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein. Villafafia told OPR\nthat the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be\noad Villafafia had assured Lefkouitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would\nremain part of our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would\ndistribute without compulsory process.”\n228 Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have\nto “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from <span class=\"highlight\">somewhere</span>” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOTA’d.”\nad Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefited the victims were there for the victims\nto take advantage of... . and they did. Hou. . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going\nto receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”\n3oo OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place.\n\n2o7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo453l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel6 of 43 l6\nLalWmaxC\n\nl that, the defense gets ten peremptories; the government gets\n\n2 six.

Mot. at l4 (citing GX-662-R at 44)), but\nwould have accepted her much briefer and less detailed testimony about abuse in New Mexico\nsolely because it was corroborated by a flight record.°\n\nThe defendant also speculates that the jury then decided to acquit the defendant on Count\nTwo but not on Count Four because the jury convicted based on the evidence related to the New\nMexico trip. Specifically, the defendant argues that the jury acquited the defendant of enticement\nbecause the flight logs shoued that “she was present on the trip [to New Mexico] but said nothing\nabout whether she ‘persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced’ Jane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did\nnot testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell prior to the flight to New Mexico in\nwhich they discussed the trip.” (Def. Mot. at l5).

There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nLe According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023150.jpg": "The Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes, 78\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia recetved several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last! Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.” The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be <span class=\"highlight\">somewhere</span> ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months.
