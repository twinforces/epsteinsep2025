There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command .. . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges]... , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nHu According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nHS Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021312.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON B38. 3536o38, Pagel4o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 348\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes. ‘7°\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last! Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.” The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be <span class=\"highlight\">somewhere</span> ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months.
