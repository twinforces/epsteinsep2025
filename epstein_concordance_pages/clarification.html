U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d loll, lol6-l7 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (fairness and dignity are\nsubstantive, enforceable rights); Jn re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l, 394-95 (5th Cir. 2oo8) (government must\nconfer with victims before making consequential case decisions); Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d l244 (llth\nCir. 2o2l) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully atached post-conviction).\nGiven our history fighting for the enforcement of the CVRA on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein’s many\nvictims, we were quite surprised to learn that the government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a step required\nby the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided <span class=\"highlight\">clarification</span>. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 27\n\nDuring the first deposition on April 22, 2ol6, the subject of Count 5 of the Indictment,\nMs. Maxwell was peppered with ambiguous questions about decades-old events in unidentified\nlocations at unspecified times. The questions contained argumentative, loaded words and\nphrases that Giuffre’s lawyers refused to define or clarify and asked Ms. Maxwell to speculate\nabout Epstein’s intent and state of mind. The vast majority of the questions had nothing to do\nwith the actual truth or falsity of the claims of Giuffre that Ms. Maxwell pointed out as “obvious\nlies.” Counsel for Ms. Maxwell was required to object to hundreds of questions that suffered\nfrom a myriad of form and/or foundational infirmities. Ms. Maxwell, when siting for these\ndepositions, knew she had done nothing wrong and was unaware that Giuffre’s lawyers were\nencouraging the Government to initiate a criminal investigation.* And had, no motive to lie in\nresponse, particularly given that Epstein had long ago served a prison sentence in Florida arising\nout of the same conduct that was the subject of the defamation action.\n\nAlthough a few lines of that first deposition testimony are quoted in the Indictment, the\nGovernment improperly redacted objections to the questions and omited important preceding\nand follouing pages of testimony. The omited portions of the transcript include numerous\nobjections and requests for <span class=\"highlight\">clarification</span> regarding terms that the Government selectively quotes\nin the Indictment, such as “scheme,” “recruit,” and “sexual massage.” The two answers that the\nGovernment claims were knouingly and materially false statements were “I don’t knou what\n\n+ Stephen Rex Broun, “Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6: sources,” New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o)\n(htps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6ebfnszu-story.html) (detailing David Boies’ purported efforts to urge the SDNY US\nAtorney’s Office to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in February 2ol6, shortly before her first deposition, and\nagain after her second deposition, arguing in apparent violation of the protective order that she had\ncommited perjury during her “confidential” depositions).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo24l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 239\ninteractions with the defendant and Epstein at Epstein’s various properties. See, e.g., Indictment\n§{ 7(a) (“MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-l on multiple occasions at\nEpstein’s residences.”). Accordingly, a rational juror, after hearing the evidence, could find that\nthe question called for the names of minors that the defendant interacted with at any of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s properties, that the defendant answered that she was aware of no such minors other than\nGiuffre, and therefore that her answer was false. And even if the defendant identifies some\nplausible ambiguity—and she has not—the terms in this question are ones “with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree,” and therefore are not fundamentally ambiguous.\nLighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThe defendant points out that, in response to an earlier question asking her to list the\nunderage girls she “met and brought” to Epstein’s house, she said that she could not do so. (Def.\nMot. 4 at l2-l3). She argues that the charged question was “improper” because it asked her to\ngenerate a list “from events that had happened nearly two decades previously.” (/d.). Her\nunpersuasive after-the-fact efforts to justify her answer provide no basis to keep this question from\nthe jury. As noted above, the transcript makes clear (and a jury could find) that when the defendant\ndid not understand or could not answer a question, she said so. To the extent the defendant is\narguing that her answer was literally true, a reasonable jury could find otherwise. In this respect,\nthe Government notes, among other things, that in response to the earlier question, the defendant\nsaid that she could not make a list not because she could not remember events from that long ago\nbut “because that list -- it never happened that I can think of.” (Ex. lo at 382:4-l3) (emphasis\nadded).

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights <span class=\"highlight\">Clarification</span> Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

For example, criminal jury trials requesting a\nparticular jury selection date are given priority over civil jury trials requesting that same date.\nCriminal trials involving detained defendants are given priority over criminal trials in which\ndefendants are not detained pre-trial. Among detained defendants, cases that set trial dates prior\nto March l6, 2o2o get priority.

This Court ordered that the parties meet and confer regarding a trial start date and\nto \"agree to the earliest possible trial date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in\norder to facilitate an early fall trial start date.\" (Dkt. 266 at 3). Defense counsel atempted to\nconfer with the government in good faith to find a mutually acceptable date. We sent several\nemails to counsel stating our reliance on our April 22d submission (Dkt. 246) where we specified\nour conflicts and the justification for our request. By contrast, and despite our requests for\n<span class=\"highlight\">clarification</span>, the government failed to provide any details to justify its request to delay the trial\nstart to November 29, 2o2l. Instead, the government filed a lengthy submission to the Court,\ncomplete with case law citations, at 8:l2 p.m., a few hours before the deadline for the “joint\nleter.” Moreover, the government also audaciously seeks by way of their joint leter regarding\nthe trial date to re-litigate the schedule this Court has already crafted after hearing from the\nparties both on submissions and in person, without even the courtesy of a motion for\nreconsideration on that schedule.\n\nFor the reasons previously detailed in our April 22d leter to the Court, defense counsel’s\nearliest possible — and preferred — trial start date is November 8\". As the Court is aware, Judge\nFurman moved my October 4\" trial to March, clearing the way for this trial to start on November\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

(“Sketch artists . .. may not draw exact likenesses of jurors or witnesses\nother than co-defendants should they testify ....”). It would defeat the purpose of the Court’s\norder if the exact likeness of those witnesses could be drawn and subsequently publicized in the\nmedia. Although courtroom sketch artists might voluntarily elect not to sketch these witness’s\nfaces, the Government seeks an order so it can provide certainty to these witnesses in advance of\ntheir testimony.\n\n' The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v.

In particular, the defense is still unclear whether we will be permited to display\ndocuments used for impeachment or refreshing a witness’s recollection in electronic format solely on the\nvideo screens used by the witness, the Court, and the Court’s deputy, or whether we will be required to\nprovide paper copies of these materials, even if the materials do not reference a witness who is testifying\nunder a pseudonym. !\n\nThe defense is sensitive to the Court and the government’s concerns that people siting in the\ngallery of the courtroom do not see any documents that identify the witnesses who are testifying under\npseudonyms. We also understand that the Court wants to ensure that the witnesses will have access to\nthe complete documents that may be used for impeachment and refreshing recollection, rather than a\n' Counsel for the defense understood the discussion on November 23, 2o2l, to apply only to documents which\ncontained identifying information for witnesses who are testifying under pseudonyms or first names.

Engelmayer\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\n) Page 3\n\nsome, the Maxwell conviction is the only meaningful measure of criminal accountability;\n\nits erosion would be devastating.’\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided <span class=\"highlight\">clarification</span>. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 26 of l97 2567\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl timeline, which she said she does not remember and is not a\n\n2 basis for inconsistency and it goes to a collateral mater.\n\n3 532, sustained.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks <span class=\"highlight\">clarification</span> about\nthe line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States\nv. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the Government\nidentifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not\nlimit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination.

The Court received statements from Annie Farmer,\nKate, Virginia Giuffre, Maria Farmer, Sarah Ransome, Teresa Helm, Juliete Bryant, and\nElizabeth Stein.

Further, having nou reviewed the full set of requests,\nand having heard from the Government that it does not object, Dkt.

The jury was free to send a clarifying or further note\nfollouing the Court’s instruction.\n\nBy contrast, the Defendant failed to propose a legally accurate response for the jury. Her\nproposed responses to the note on the day it was received and the follouing morning were\nerroneous. At the time the Court received the note and discussed it with counsel, the Defendant\nfirst proposed that the answer to the note’s question was simply “no” because, she argued, a\nreturn flight is for the purpose of returning home, “not for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.”\nTrial Tr. at 3l28-3o. But the Court could not respond “no” to an ambiguous question. /d. at\n3l38. Moreover, the Defendant eventually conceded the principle that assistance with a return\nflight home could aid and abet a trip that was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity. See id. at\n3l36. Alternatively, the Defendant requested that if the Court were to refer the jury to the\ncharge, that it direct the jury to lines l4 to l7 of Instruction No. 2l, which instructed on\n“significant or motivating purpose.” /d. at 3l3l. But it was unclear that those particular lines\naddressed the jury’s question, and the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the entirety of\nInstruction No. 2l encompassed those lines.\n\nThe follouing day, although the jury had not sought further <span class=\"highlight\">clarification</span>, the Defendant\ntook another pass at proposing an additional response to the note.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights <span class=\"highlight\">Clarification</span> Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.
