Judge Berman:\n\nI come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of hou the United States of\nAmerica’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse <span class=\"highlight\">quotations</span> because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Shou us all the files with\nonly the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”. In the end we are the biggest voices of the truth and the truth always comes\nout in time.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo759", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001319.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2 of 25\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York, by the Honorable Alison J.\nNathan, United States District Judge.\n\n3.

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal <span class=\"highlight\">quotations</span> omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 3 of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of\nthis case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be\nmeaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of discovery.

The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the\ndefendant’s counsel who represent her in both this criminal mater as well as in certain civil\nmaters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials\nin discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo).

Here, the NPA unambiguously precludes prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators, and the indictment in this case must be dismissed.\n\nIn support of its July 2o2o motion for Ms. Maxwell’s detention, the government raised\nthree arguments why it contends the NPA does not bar Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution: (l) that Ms.\nMaxwell supposedly lacks standing to enforce the NPA; (i) that the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision applies only in the SDFL; and (i) that the provision is limited to conduct occurring\nduring the 2ool-o7 time period and to violations of statutes specifically referenced in the NPA.\nGovernment’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention (“Reply Mem.”), Dkt.

Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nEven if the 2oo3 Amendment could be retroactively applied to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct during the l99os, Counts One through Four would still be time-barred for a separate and\nindependent reason: Section 3283 does not apply to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is\ncharged. Section 3283 extends the statute of limitations only for “offense[s] involving the sexual\nor physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, but none\nof the offenses charged in Counts One through Four is such an offense.’\n\nA. Section 3283 applies only to offenses that necessarily entail the sexual or\n\nphysical abuse, or kidnapping, of a child.\n\nA long line of cases establishes that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain\nconduct means an offense that “necessarily requir[es]” that conduct. Shular v. United States, l4o\nS. Ct. 779, 785 (2o2o) (internal <span class=\"highlight\">quotations</span> omited). Those cases date back at least to Bridges v.\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which construed the Wartime Suspension of Limitations\nAct’s extension of statutes of limitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud\nagainst the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 3287 (l95o) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held\nthat that extension was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud\nthe United States is an essential ingredient of the offense charged.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 22l.\nThus, the Court held that charges that the defendant knouingly made and conspired to make\nfalse statements in a naturalization proceeding, and that he aided and abeted a fraudulent\ncertificate of naturalization, were subject to the general statute of limitations and not the\nexception, because “fraud is not an essential ingredient” of such offenses, and “[t]he offense is\ncomplete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it.” Jd. at 222.\n\n’ The words “or kidnaping” were added as part of the 2oo3 Amendment. 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l6\n§ 2422(a) and § 2423(a) conspiracies to cause individuals to travel in interstate or foreign\ncommerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity. /d. 99 lld, l7d.\nARGUMENT\nI.

The\nindictment is plainly insufficient to allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel, or to transport her in interstate or foreign commerce, let alone with the requisite intent.\nMoreover, the allegations regarding Accuser-3 have nothing to do with whether Ms. Maxwell\nconspired to violate § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Thus, the\nonly explanation for the inclusion of alleged 2o-year-old allegations involving Accuser-3, and\nthe characterization of the alleged conduct as “sexual abuse,” is the likelihood that evidence\nsubmited in support of those allegations will have an unduly prejudicial effect and would not\nsurvive a balancing analysis under Fed.

The government’s oun\nfile demonstrates that the FBI had interviewed Accuser-2° in 2oo6 (Opp. l6 n.9; Dkt. l48, Ex.

Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as\none of the individuals that the FBI’s Miami office “began investigating” in 2oo6 as part of the\ninvestigation that led to the NPA. (See Ex. A). Thus, the government was clearly aware of Ms.\nMaxwell at the time it executed the NPA and agreed to extend the immunity provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators.” She is covered by the NPA.\n\nAs a third party immunized by the NPA, Ms. Maxwell has third-party beneficiary status\nto enforce it.

And it is entirely logical that the government\nagreed to a broader immunity for potential co-conspirators, whom it had no interest in\nprosecuting, than for Epstein himself, who was the sole focus of the government’s prosecution\nefforts.

Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the discretion to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed.

The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are unrelated to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence introduced in connection with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater.

Furthermore, Accuser-4 alleged that led Accuser-4 upstairs to Epstein’s\nbedroom the first time she gave him a massage by herself (id. at 25:7-l5) and that paid\nAccuser-4 $5oo to take nude photographs of her at the Palm Beach residence at Epstein’s request\n(id. at 27:l-lo).\n\nUltimately, the proposed SDFL indictment sought to charge Epstein not Ms.\nMaxwell, with a sex trafficking offense involving Accuser-4.

This is entirely consistent with the language of the\nNPA, PY and not Ms. Maxwell, as one of the four named “potential co-\nconspirators.” (Ex. B at 5 of 7).

It would\nalso be entirely unjust to base a prosecution in this District on the same offenses related to the\nsame accuser who never mentioned Ms. Maxwell—and instead implicated a vben\nshe first reported the allegations that form the basis of Counts Five and Six over thirteen years\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293_ Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o of 32\nprogeny do not control.* The Court should instead follou Gebbie and find that NPA precludes\nthe USAO-SDNY from charging Counts Five and Six.\n\nThis result is consistent with the terms and the drafting history of the NPA. As noted in\nour previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision of the NPA stands in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is\nexpressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt. 223 at 9-lo). The broad language of the co-conspirator\nprovision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his atorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFL, that\nhe would be “the only one who takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR Report at l67\n(internal <span class=\"highlight\">quotations</span> omited)). Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal “to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability,” which is set forth in the factual recitals of the\nNPA. (Ex. B at 2 of 7; see also Ex. D § 5 (declaration of AUSA A. Marie Villafafia noting that\nEpstein “sought a global resolution of the mater”). Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware\nthat the investigation had extended beyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses.\nIndeed, we nou knou from discovery recently produced by the government that the government\ninterviewed at least three New York-based witnesses in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation, two of whom implicated other potential co-conspirators of Epstein. (Exs. E-G).\nHence, these provisions of the NPA reflect Epstein’s desire to ensure that he would not become\nembroiled in subsequent prosecutions of his “potential co-conspirators” in any other districts.\n(Dkt. 223 at ll).\n\nMoreover, this result is consistent with fundamental fairness.

The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions.

Throughout the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished.

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal <span class=\"highlight\">quotations</span> omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019604.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Pagel3 of l5\nprotective order), superseded by rule on other grounds as recognized in Bond v.

Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal <span class=\"highlight\">quotations</span>\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n> Tt is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o969", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021663.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Pagel6 of 93\n8\n\nworked together to identify girls, groom them, and\nthen entice them to travel and transport them to Ep-\nstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico,\nand elsewhere.

Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v.

The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999"};
