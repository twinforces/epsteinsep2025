The report of the Inspector General, as to both defendants, including, any\nand all supporting memorandums, writen statements, photos, videos, and\nincident reports\n\nThe defendant is entitled to complete disclosure of the Inspector General’s report.\nMoreover, Mr. Thomas has a right to any and all information obtained in this investigation. Not\nonly is it possible that this report contains additional witness statements but this report also has\n. information that has not been furnished by the government in any capacity previously. Moreover,\n_ While the government would like to limit its discovery obligation to reports, videos and\ndocuments related specifically to night and early morning hours of August lo, 2ol9, the defense\nsubmits that there is a much larger context that lead to those events and the charges against\nMichael Thomas. Indeed, the Atorney General of the United States and the “acting”\ncommissioner of the BOP opened an investigation that was precipitated by the events of August\nlo, 2ol9 but said investigation was much more expansive and in-depth. In November 2ol9, the\n, “acting” commissioner Kathleen Hawks Sawyer stated at a congressional hearing under oath that\nthere were more than 33oo <span class=\"highlight\">vacancies</span> within the BOP and she was surprised that the BOP was\nable to function with nth issues. She went on to state that: “The vast majority of staff are good,\nhardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched.” (See article atached as\nExhibit E.) The broad depth of the Inspector General’s report presumably was that there were a\nmyriad of systematic issues affecting the BOP that alloued the events of August lo, 2ol9 and\nthe death of Jeffrey Epstein to occur. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to disclosure of any\nand all of this information, especiaily if it relates to his defense of the charges that have been\ninitiated, It is the defendant’s contention that this report may also contain Brady-Giglio material.\nIndeed, the prosecutors in this case may be denying the defendant his right to this material\nwithout any knouledge of its contents. If so, this is a dereliction of their duty and denies Mr.\n\nThomas important rights that are the foundation of our judicial system.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o32", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022056.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 33 of 38\n4f2o2o Lack of Staff and Resources Continues to Stain the Fedeal Bureau of Prisons - Oversight - Gevernment Executive\nGovernment\nExecutive\nLack of Staff and Resources Continue to Strain the Federal Bureau\nof Prisons\nBy Courtney Buble\nNovember l9, 2ol2 :\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons is severely lacking in staff and resources, the director testified before a Senate panel on Tuesday.\nKathleen Hawk Sawyer, who was bureau director from l992-2oo8, came out of retirement to lead the agency again afteracting direclor Hugh Hurwitz was\nreassigned in the aftermath of financier and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s death in August while in federal custody. As the bureau, which oversees\nl22 federal prisons and more than l7o,ooo inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with the circumstances\nthat led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer.\n“\\We have put such huge strains on the Burean of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission,\" Hawk Sawyer said before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, “With\nthe dramatic grouth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages, it’s just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last l6\nyears that I've been gone.” The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched,\" she added.\nHawk Sawyer atributed the resouree problem to the rapid increase in the prison population in the last 3o years, employees retiring at a faster rate than they\n. are hired, uncertain budgets, ihe recent government shutdoun andthe hiring [freeze early in the Trump administration. \"We have never had adequate\n__ Pesources to provide all the programs for all the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change nou since you all support the First Step Act.”\nAccording to the hurean's website it currently has 96,348 staff members. The New York Times reported:\nBetween December 2ol6 and September 2ol8 — the date of the most recent data available from the federal Office of Personnel Management — the number of\ncorrectional officers fell more than ll%, from l9,o82 to l6,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend. Before President Doneld Trump tock office, the\nnumber of federal correctional officers had continuously increased: there were l2.5% more officers at the end of 2ol6 compared to the beginning of 2ol2.\nHawk Sawyer said the bureau has “made great progress\" to fill the over 3,3oo <span class=\"highlight\">vacancies</span> nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff,\nthe bureau is working with the Office of Personnel Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a temporary basis because they are already\n- \" trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online.\nSawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources. She expects the agency will receive\n$75 million in this year’s appropriations for the First Step Act, which the law requires for the first five years, although she hoped for more.

The drop in staffing that they are referring to\nalso likely includes the 5l56 unfunded vacant positions that were eliminated...positions we never could fill in\nthe first place.\n\n>\n\n> We do not need more staff, we just need to fill the <span class=\"highlight\">vacancies</span> we have. | continue to point out to anyone\nthat will listen (and have reiterated this in several Hill briefings), the problem is not our authorized staffing\nlevels or funding, rather it is finding good candidates to come work for us in hard to fill areas. | have dozens\nof examples where we post jobs, get 3o applicants and only lo end up actually coming on board. At that\nrate it will take a long time just to fill the <span class=\"highlight\">vacancies</span> we have. We are working on several new initiatives to try\nand make BOP more atractive to applicants (unfortunately news like this does not help).\n\n>\n\n> Anyway, | knou you knou this, but also want you to knou that we are working to change this narrative, but\nright nou we are geting drouned out by the media hysteria. Thanks.\n\n>\n\n> Hugh\n\nPage l652o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo26336", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027012.jpg": "Page 3423\nDate: o8/l9/2ol9 .\ntime: lo:27, AM Federal Bureau of Prisons\nTRUINTEL\nLog Entries By Event Date\nSensitive But Unclassified\nEntered Date ‘Alpha Code Level l Location’ Level 2 Location —_ Level 3 Location \" EventDate Shift User _—‘ Event ..
