The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7*> Although OPR found no decisive\na Julie K.

Simply put, the defense does not need to investigate crimes with which the defendant is\nnot charged.\n\nMoreover, the defense’s most recent leter refers to these materials as somehou\nconstituting Brady material without any explanation of what information within the most recent\nproduction is supposedly exculpatory. But given that, as noted above, a significant majority of the\nnon-testifying witness materials do not reference the defendant, to the extent the defense is\nsuggesting that the existence of victims who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein without assistance\nfrom the defendant constitutes Brady material, the Government has repeatedly noted that such\nevidence is not exculpatory.

Regardless, the defense has ample time to review these materials in advance of\ntrial, and the Government intended to produce all of these materials to the defense with or without\na superseding indictment.* Thus, the defense would have needed to review and investigate these\nmaterials even if the Government never obtained the S2 Indictment.

The Government has repeatedly asked MDC legal counsel to\nlocate this CD and provide it to the defendant, and today MDC legal counsel confirmed that the\nCD would be delivered to the defendant this afternoon.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has gone to significant lengths to address the technical\nissues defense counsel have raised with respect to the discovery, and to ensure that the defendant\nexpeditiously receives copies of each production. Indeed, in November 2o2o, the undersigned\nhand delivered a laptop and discovery production to the MDC for the defendant, and the\nGovernment understands the defendant received those items that same day.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\na Julie K.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\n\nMDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> to ensure\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o264", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021289.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ATIS 3536o38, Pagell7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 348\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.’\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 38\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta was previously\nscheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October ll and to speak at the Palm\nBeach County Bench Bar conference the follouing midday, and that he stayed <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> at the\nMarriot.\nDB Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury maters.\nl38 OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.\n89\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l289", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021360.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARG 3536o38, Pagel88 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l86 of 348\n2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “‘a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.”*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\noo Julie K.

During the night, instead of completing the\nrequired counts and rounds, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the\ndefendants, were seated at the correctional officers’ desk in the\nSHU common area (as noted above, approximately l5 feet from\nEpstein’s cell), used the computers, and moved around the SHU\ncommon area. For a period of approximately two hours, NOBEL and\nTHOMAS sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been\nasleep. NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the night,\nincluding to search the internet for furniture sales and benefit\nwebsites.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.'3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties.

October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7*° Although OPR found no decisive\n238 Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l98", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023369.jpg": "moved by medical staff to the MCC New York Health Service Unit.’ The Clinical Nurse continuously\nadministered CPR until he was relieved by outside Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) when they arrived\nat the Health Services Area minutes later. The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered\nmedication and fluids in their efforts to revive him. At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause\nof Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\n<span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\n| Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

Noel said she observed Thomas lifting Epstein from under his\narms and dragging him back out of the corner of the cell and laid him doun on the ground to perform CPR.\nAccording to Noel, within seconds of Thomas calling out for the cuter she hit the body alarm, which is a\nbuton on an MCC staff member's radio that is used to signal distress or an emergency. Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier. Noel said she was alone\nin the SHU for 2o minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get\nstatus updates.\nNoel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately l5 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station. Noel said she\nwould have knoun if someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> and no one did. She also said that\nthere was no indication that any of the inmates could have goten out of their cells. Noel said she never\nslept during her shift on August 9-lo, 2ol9. Noel said that when she is seen on the camera at the desk not\nmoving, she was on the computer. Noel then clarified by saying that she worked 5 days of overtime leading\nup to her shift, so she would begin to doze off; houever, she caught herself and never slept.\nThe Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant who relieved the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 5:3o a.m. The Lieutenant said that at\napproximately 6:33 a.m., he heard a call for a medical emergency in the SHU and immediately responded to\nthe alarm. When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed\nthat Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The\nLieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.\nThe MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.\nWhen the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members\nwere picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher. The Electronics Technician said he and Senior\nOfficer Specialist 6 performed chest compressions on Epstein while he was on the stretcher and being\ntransported to the Health Services Unit on the second floor.*? The Electronics Technician stated that he\n42 Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff\nand Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies,\nand allous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because COs can directly escort EMTs to\nthe Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

The primary entrance to the SHU (Main Exterior\nEntry Door) was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York's centralized Control Center.\nAdditionally, there was a second locked door at the main entrance (Main Interior Entry Door), which could\nbe opened only with a key held by a limited number of Correctional Officers (CO) while on duty.°> Within the\nSHU, the entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the top or botom of the\nstaircase leading to the individual tier. Keys to open the locked tier doors were available only to a limited\nnumber of COs while on duty. Each tier had eight cells, each of which could house either one or two\ninmates. Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be accessed only through a\nsingle locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty. The SHU cell doors were\nmade of solid metal with a small glass windou and small locked slots that correctional staff used to handcuff\ninmates and provide food and toiletries to inmates. As a further security measure, during each shift a\nlimited number of the COs had keys while on duty.\nBOP policy and practice require that all SHU inmates be locked in their cells <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span>. The OIG found no\nevidence indicating that the door to Epstein’s cell or any other cell in the SHU tier in which Epstein was\nhoused was unlocked on the evening of August 9-lo, 2ol9, after SHU staff locked Epstein in his cell at\napproximately 8 p.m. SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were\nlocked in their cells for the evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could\nhave goten out of their cells. Epstein did not have a cellmate after Inmate 3 was transferred out of MCC\nNew York on August 9, and therefore Epstein was alone in his cell the evening of August 9-lo. The door to\nEpstein’s cell was visible from the SHU Officers’ Station, and CO Tova Noel and Material Handler\nMichael Thomas told the OIG that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell during their shift on August lo.\nBoth of them further described delivering breakfast to the L Tier at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo, and hou\nNoel unlocked the door to the L Tier, Thomas entered the L Tier and called for Epstein, and then Thomas\nunlocked his cell door when Epstein failed to respond. Additionally, the three inmates who were housed in\nthe same SHU tier as Epstein on August 9 and lo, and who had a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s\ncell from their cells, stated that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein\nto his cell on the evening of August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC\nNew York SHU.\nFurther, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common area of\nthe SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's video\nrecording issues that we detailed in Chapter 6. The OIG’s analysis of the recorded video did not identify any\nCOs (other than those assigned to the SHU during that timeframe or had a specific reason for visiting the\nSHU) or other individuals present in the common area of the SHU approach any of the SHU tiers, including\nthe L Tier where Epstein was housed, between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and approximately\n6:3o a.m. on August lo. In sum, the OIG’s investigation did not find any evidence that anyone was present in\n55 The primary entrance doors to the MCC New York SHU are shoun in Figure 4.l. Access to the secondary entrance to\nthe SHU, which was adjacent to the elevator bay on the south side of the floor, was also controlled by an exterior entry\ndoor opened by the Control Center and an interior door opened only with a key held by one of the COs assigned to the\nSHU while on duty. The secondary entrance doors to the SHU are shoun in Figure 4.2.\n\n95\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23462", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023512.jpg": "Fwd: Epstein\nron\nTo Lee Plourde\nDate 2ol9/o8/lo lo:56\nSubject: Fwd: Epstein\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone\n-------- Original message --------\nDate: 8/lo/l9 lo:54 AM (GMT-o5:oo)\n[oi bop 2ov>\nSubject: Epstein\n>>> o8/lo/2ol9 lo:54 >>>\nHi I'm a legal reporter with the Wall Street Journal.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties.

October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.734 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\n234 Julie K.

The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered\nmedication and fluids in their efforts to revive him. At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause\nof Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\n<span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span> observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\nl Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier.

The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds.

The primary entrance to the SHU (Main Exterior\nEntry Door) was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York's centralized Control Center.\nAdditionally, there was a second locked door at the main entrance (Main Interior Entry Door), which could\nbe opened only with a key held by a limited number of Correctional Officers (CO) while on duty.°> Within the\nSHU, the entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the top or botom of the\nstaircase leading to the individual tier. Keys to open the locked tier doors were available only to a limited\nnumber of COs while on duty. Each tier had eight cells, each of which could house either one or two\ninmates. Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be accessed only through a\nsingle locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty. The SHU cell doors were\nmade of solid metal with a small glass windou and small locked slots that correctional staff used to handcuff\ninmates and provide food and toiletries to inmates. As a further security measure, during each shift a\nlimited number of the COs had keys while on duty.\nBOP policy and practice require that all SHU inmates be locked in their cells <span class=\"highlight\">overnight</span>. The OIG found no\nevidence indicating that the door to Epstein’s cell or any other cell in the SHU tier in which Epstein was\nhoused was unlocked on the evening of August 9-lo, 2ol9, after SHU staff locked Epstein in his cell at\napproximately 8 p.m. SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were\nlocked in their cells for the evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could\nhave goten out of their cells. Epstein did not have a cellmate after Inmate 3 was transferred out of MCC\nNew York on August 9, and therefore Epstein was alone in his cell the evening of August 9-lo.

Additionally, the three inmates who were housed in\nthe same SHU tier as Epstein on August 9 and lo, and who had a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s\ncell from their cells, stated that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein\nto his cell on the evening of August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC\nNew York SHU.\nFurther, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common area of\nthe SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's video\nrecording issues that we detailed in Chapter 6.
