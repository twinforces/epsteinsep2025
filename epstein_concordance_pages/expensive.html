Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 7\n2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community\n\nThe dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “guarantee”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance whatsoever. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or.

Botero, 6o4 F. Supp. lo28, lo35 (S.D. Fla. l985). . The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\n<span class=\"highlight\">expensive</span> process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000336.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 8 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 8\n4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very <span class=\"highlight\">expensive</span> form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape atempt while in the community and involving\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo336", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001165.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck 3 Ob 36\ncomplicated, and <span class=\"highlight\">expensive</span> process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.

First, as highlighted by the motion, the information purportedly sought is\ncumulative and duplicative. By way of example, Plaintiff has already deposed Johanna Sjoberg\n(a former Epstein employee), Juan Alessi (a former Epstein employee), and David Rodgers*\n(former Epstein Pilot). She further seeks to depose Maria Alessi and Jo Fontanella (former\nEpstein household employees), as well as Dana Bums and Emmy Taylor (identified as assistants\nto Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein). The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may\nhave is identical to that of each other — what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff\ngoes so far as to state that Maria Alessi’s deposition is expected to “corroborate” the\nobservations of her husband’s.\n\nPlaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is “obtaining\nwitnesses, like Ms. Sjoberg, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Yet, Ms.\nSjoberg did not “corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Instead, she testified that [jj\nees\n——————————— Ss\n———$<—— OOOO\nI\nRegardless, Plaintiff is looking in vain for more testimony of exactly the same character,\nprecisely the type of testimony the presumptive limit is intended to prevent.\n\nSimilarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe\nRecarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.\n\n* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the\nscheduled court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239).

The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00025923.jpg": "Page 2o7l\nA couple of issues came out of the Epstein Reconstruction which | wanted to problem solve when you have\nan opportunity to meet:\nOther issues regarding the SW program:\nl.

I would not have been\nable to [do] this if it wasn’t for Mr. Epstein.\nAnother example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is puting\nthrough vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke\nrelated that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and\nmentor Mr. Diaz.\n\nA final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:\n\nWhile working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a\nrelationship with the cleaning man who details our office space.

One night our sign language, broken\nEnglish and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter atending\ncollege.

This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively <span class=\"highlight\">expensive</span> in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical insurance.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233"};
