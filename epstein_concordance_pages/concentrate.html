STERNHEIAA\nespecially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up\nnegative.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is required to remove her PPE mask during physical searches,\nsubjecting her to higher risk of exposure to COVID. The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\nemployment as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\nnutrition, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto <span class=\"highlight\">concentrate</span> and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and\n<span class=\"highlight\">concentrate</span> and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep\nnegatively impacts her concentration and ability to focus on document review and defense\npreparation.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool873", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l59 Filed o2/l6/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

During daytime hours she was isolated in a larger\nspace. Atno time did she have contact with any other inmate. She was watched round-the-clock\nby a security detail dedicated exclusively to guard her as she was consistently monitored by video\nsurveillance. Her security detail rotated every two weeks and consisted of high-level BOP staffers\nrecruited from facilities outside New York who were instructed to guard a high-profile, high-\nsecurity inmate on suicide watch.'* Ms. Maxwell was subject to constantly changing rules and\nwhims. Her only source of information was from the guards who controlled her. They became the\nsource of information regarding rules, regulations, and opportunities. If they chose not to dispense\ninformation or if they provided incorrect information, she had no basis to challenge them. She was\ninstructed not to speak to them lest she face disciplinary sanction. Such is not the case in general\npopulation, where inmates assist other inmates and bear witness to and identify inconsistent and\nimproper treatment.\n\nUnlike other inmates, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to various prohibitions and deprivations\nnot common to other inmates. She was monitored 24 hours a day by stationary security cameras\nand by an additional hand-held camera that folloued her while under the constant surveillance of\nseveral prison guards who scrutinized her every move, even when she was shouering, and taking\nnotes of her activities and recording them in various notebooks.
