The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a <span class=\"highlight\">structured</span> interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a <span class=\"highlight\">structured</span> interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were <span class=\"highlight\">structured</span> like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 36 of55\nquotation marks omited); see United States v.

And even when Guidelines commentary is explanatory and binding, it is “akin to an\nagency’s interpretation of its oun legislative rules,” and therefore does not control where it is\n“inconsistent with the regulation.” Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 45 (l993) (quoting\nBoules v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 4lo, 4l4 (l945)). Ifthe Guidelines commentary\nwere flatly inconsistent with the plain text of the Guideline itself—because the Guideline squarely\napplies where the commentary says it should not—the Guideline itself would control. See Sash,\n396 F.3d at 522 (“We need not resort to background commentary interpretations when the\nlanguage of the Guidelines is plain.”).\n\nFinally, the defendant’s argument that the public does not need to be protected from her is\nan available argument under § 3553(a), but it is not a justification for deviating from the text of\nthe Guidelines.*\n\nIll. Discussion\nA. The Defendant’s Conduct Warrants a Term of Imprisonment Within the\nGuidelines Range of 36o to 66o Months’ Imprisonment\nl. The Nature and Seriousness of the Offense\n\nThe defendant stands convicted of sexually exploiting multiple underage girls. Her crimes\nwere monstrous, and the Court should impose a sentence that reflects her role in serious federal\n‘ The defendant also argues that application of the Guideline to her would yield absurd results,\nbecause she would have a louer sentencing range if she had been convicted of a prior sex offense,\nand (she claims) the same sentencing range that Epstein would face. (Def. Mem. l4-l6). But\nSection 4Bl.5(a) is <span class=\"highlight\">structured</span> differently than Section 4Bl.5(b), seting floors for the offense level\nand criminal history category rather than imposing a five-level increase. See U.S.S.G. Amend.\n6l5 (explaining that § 4Bl.5(a)’s penalties rely on the prior conviction but § 4Bl.5(b) does not).\nBecause the Guidelines have different structures, where—as here—a defendant is near the top of\nthe Guidelines by virtue of her criminal conduct on her one and only conviction, the five-level\nenhancement is more significant than § 4Bl.5’s penalty floors.

No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were <span class=\"highlight\">structured</span> like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o962", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022452.jpg": "Page 6o\nl wasn't responsible for any of the client's money or\n2 anything like that.
