Additionally, Epstein ouns a\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary\nresidence in the United States. His mansion in Manhatan alone—a multi-story tounhouse\nreported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhatan, which previously housed a\nschool and which he ouns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.\nEntities controlled by the defendant also oun at least two private jets in active service, at least one\nof which is capable of intercontinental travel.\n\nAs described further belou, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,\nand his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to\nmaintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past l8 months alone, the\ndefendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately\nmore than 2o occasions.\n\nC. The Prior Florida Investigation\n\nIn or about 2oo5, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in\nconnection with allegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\nconnection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\nidentified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the conclusion of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district.

That conduct is 2oo2 to\nl5 2oo5. It is our belief that this is basically a re-do. This\nl6 is basically the Feds today, not happy with what happened in\nl7 the decision that led to the NPA, redoing the same conduct that\nl8 was investigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of\nl9 prostitution, calling it sex trafficking.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.'°! The USAO, with the good faith approval of\nEpstein’s counsel, would select an atorney representative for the victims,\nwhom Epstein would pay.\n\nTiming: Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced\nby October 26, 2oo7. The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3288", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epsteim’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3289", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003297.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 348\nnot recall for OPR the substance of his conversation with Starr, other than that it was likely about\nEpstein’s wish to have the Department review the case. '*”\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice. Kept me on the phone\nfor [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3297", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3299", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 348\nthese victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY — JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'® Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ. Ken [Starr]\nand I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to\nour seeking appellate review within DOJ.\n\nStarr, Lefkouitz, and Martin Weinberg atended the March l2, 2oo8 meeting, as well as\nthe former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.\nOosterban, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department. The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims. During 2oo7-2oo8, the atorney\nlo6\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olce/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.?”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS <span class=\"highlight\">NOTIFICATION</span> PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3396", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters: (l) initial <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.””” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.

August 2oo6: The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 223 of 348\nee.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . | was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVU. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM <span class=\"highlight\">NOTIFICATION</span> DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record.

According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*°!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*° Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

I did not get the opportunity to meet\n\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\n\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\n\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\ncoordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [professional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°°\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. ...

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.”° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.>!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief’ to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter.

December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by ether Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?° The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3423", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25o of 348\nif you have additional questions which invelve this mater, please coniact the office listed above, When\nyou call, please provide the.file number located af tha top of this leter.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”*\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned. n late Janua , as Villafafia and the ria orney prepared to participate\n\ngned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villaf: d the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participat\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

[and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”>°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

Villafafia recalled mentioning the conversation to her\nsupervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance\nto us and... could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and\nshould be prosecuted.”\n\nNevertheless, when OPR asked Villafafia why she did not inform Edwards of the same\ninformation that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2oo7 and January 2oo8,\nVillafafia explained that she felt “prohibited”:\n\nAt the time that I spoke with him, you knou, there had been all of\nthis . . . leter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I\nhad been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose\nthings further and not to have any involvement in victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him\nabout the existence of the NPA.\nX. JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”**! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3433", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 259 of 348\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.**’\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”>°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26o of 348\nWhen asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea. Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”°°! As she did with prior draft\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.?”\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“It]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafia edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span>. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3436", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 263 of 348\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.>”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out ina leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out. Do you have a lawyer? Get name or address. If not[,]\nwhere do you want [the] leter sent? If you have questions when\nyou receive the leter, please understand that we cannot provide\nlegal advice but the lawyers at the follouing victim rights\norganizations are able to help you at no cost to you. (Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised.\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 265 of 348\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE.

The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to additional victims who had not received a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.*”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?”7\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 277 of 348\nl.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”4**\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR- oooo346l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3462", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 288 of 348\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 289 of 348\nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*!?\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29l of 348\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing.

We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing.

Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, he nonetheless left responsibility for such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 296 of 348\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*** OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3472", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*” <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *7/\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43 l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 299 of 348\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3477", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.

Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and consultation.

OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerming its victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> system.\n\n4.

OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE: ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS\nA.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll3 of 349\nit had identified as victims.'°! The USAO, with the good faith approval of\nEpstein’s counsel, would select an atorney representative for the victims,\nwhom Epstein would pay.\n\nTiming: Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced\nby October 26, 2oo7. The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll4 of 349\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender ....” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l22 of 349\nnot recall for OPR the substance of his conversation with Starr, other than that it was likely about\nEpstein’s wish to have the Department review the case.'**\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice. Kept me on the phone\nfor [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l24 of 349\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3o of 349\nthese victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®” Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4427", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ. Ken [Starr]\nand I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to\nour seeking appellate review within DOJ.\n\nStarr, Lefkouitz, and Martin Weinberg atended the March l2, 2oo8 meeting, as well as\nthe former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.\nOosterban, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department. The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims. During 2oo7-2oo8, the atorney\nlo6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo443o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l92 of 349\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4489", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 222 of 349\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters: (l) initial <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUSA/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004520.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 223 of 349\n\nC. FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004521.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 224 of 349\neaten, U.S. Department of Fustice\ngrate Federal Burcau of Investigation\nay FBI - West Palm Beach\nree cey Suite 5oo\noa 3o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) 833-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 278, 2oo6\nRe: Case Number: a\na\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Programas being a possible victim of a federal ‘\ncrime.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 227 of 349\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the\nconclusion, or. . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4524", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004530.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 233 of 349\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of .. .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM <span class=\"highlight\">NOTIFICATION</span> DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo453o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 235 of 349\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°? Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

I did not get the opportunity to meet\n\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\n\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\n\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\ncoordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [professional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°°\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. ...

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4534", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 239 of 349\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24o of 349\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4537", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24l of 349\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 242 of 349\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4539", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004540.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 243 of 349\nher a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”?\"®\n\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 244 of 349\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°?! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter was identical to the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO.

No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4545", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 25o of 349\nmeet U.S. Department of Justice\nFP gaES NN Federal Bureau of Investigation\ndar SUT»: FB| - West Palm Beach\nRON gee e Sulte 5oo.\nneti 5o6 South Flagler Drive\nae .

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter. OPR reviewed the mater as an inquiry and\ndetermined that no further action was warranted.\na3 Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New York\nPost, Jan. 25, 2oo8.\n334 An FBI interview report from May 28, 2oo8, indicates that one victim “believes Epstein should be prosecuted\nfor his actions.”\n\n224\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4548", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 253 of 349\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”**?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --...\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.*4° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\na? Villafaia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR-oooo455o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 256 of 349\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*4+ The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”*4” Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\naH In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (5th Cir. 2oo8). The Fifth Circuit opinion was not binding precedent in Florida,\nwhich is within the Eleventh Circuit.\n\n345 United States v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2oo8 WL 5ol32l, at *ll (S.D.

Although OPR focuses on Villafafia’s communications with Edwards in this section, OPR notes that Villafafa\n229\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4553", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 258 of 349\nabout the NPA because it was “confidential” and because the case was under “investigation and\nleading touards” the filing of charges. Villafafia recalled mentioning the conversation to her\nsupervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance\nto us and... could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and\nshould be prosecuted.”\n\nNevertheless, when OPR asked Villafafia why she did not inform Edwards of the same\ninformation that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2oo7 and January 2oo8,\nVillafafia explained that she felt “prohibited”:\n\nAt the time that I spoke with him, you knou, there had been all of\nthis . . . leter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I\nhad been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose\nthings further and not to have any involvement in victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him\nabout the existence of the NPA.\nX. JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”*>! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 26o of 349\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.*°”\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victms who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4557", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 26l of 349\nWhen asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea.*°° Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”**! As she did with prior draft\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“Tt]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafa edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span>. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4558", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 264 of 349\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.>”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 265 of 349\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out. Do you have a lawyer? Get name or address. If not[,]\nwhere do you want [the] leter sent? If you have questions when\nyou receive the leter, please understand that we cannot provide\nlegal advice but the lawyers at the follouing victim rights\norganizations are able to help you at no cost to you. (Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 266 of 349\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters.

In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to additional victims who had not received a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4563", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 267 of 349\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.3”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?””\n\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4564", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 278 of 349\nl.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 286 of 349\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 287 of 349\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4584", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 289 of 349\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4586", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29o of 349\nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.\"!3\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne § Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafaia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\noa According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4587", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims.

The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 293 of 349\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent— Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 294 of 349\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, he nonetheless left responsibility for such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 297 of 349\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*** OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4594", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 298 of 349\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3oo of 349\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4597", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and .. . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4599", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o3 of 349\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o7 of 349\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and consultation.

Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

Your Affiant’s leter to T.M, was hand-delivered by myself to T.M. at the time that she\nwas interviewed (Ex. 2).? Both C.W. and T.M. also received leters from the FBI's Victim-\nWitness Specialist, which were sent on January lo, 2oo8 (Exs. 3 & 4). S.R. was identified\n\\ via the FBI’s investigation in 2oo7, but she initially refused to speak with investigators.\nS.R.’s status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by\ni a\n‘Atorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of “Jane Doe,” without identifying which of\nhis clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to C.W., T.M., and S.R.\n' All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s while they were minors beginning when\n; they were fifteen years old.\n| ?Please note thal the dates on the U.S. Atorney's Office leters to C.W. and T.M. are not the\ndates that the leters were actually delivered.

[nJaturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what Cosby\n\nsaid, or anything derived from what Cosby said, | believed\n\nthen and continue to believe that a prosecution is not\n\nprecluded.\nMr. Castor testified that he intended to confer transactional immunity upon\n[Cosby] and that his pouer to do so as the sovereign was derived from\ncommon law not from the statutes of Pennsylvania. In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not prosecute Cosby.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First Assistant District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the Commonwealth or anyone representing [Cosby] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[Cosby] would never be prosecuted. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution.

Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[Cosby] atempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [Cosby] asserted the Fifth\nAmendment, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider.

With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d. The court\nnoted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but\nlimited the number to five so as to mitigate the prejudice to Cosby. The court added that\nit gave cautionary instructions on the permissible use of this evidence, designed so as to\nlimit its prejudicial impact. /d. at llo-ll.\n\nFinally, the trial court rejected Cosby’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents\nof his deposition testimony to the extent that it concerned his use of Qualudes in decades\npast. The court opined that Cosby’s “oun words about his use and knouledge of drugs\nwith a depressant effect was relevant to shou his intent and motive in giving a depressant\nto [] Constand.” /d. at ll5. Because the evidence demonstrated Cosby’s knouledge of\nthe effects of drugs such as Qualudes, the court reasoned, Cosby “either knew\n[Constand] was unconscious, or recklessly disregarded the risk that she could be.” /d.\nAs with the Rule 4o4(b) witnesses, the court found that any prejudicial effect of this\nevidence was mitigated by the court’s cautionary instructions. /d. Accordingly, the court\ntrial opined that all of the Rule 4o4(b) evidence was admissible.\n\nAt the conclusion of a second jury trial, Cosby was convicted on all three counts of\naggravated indecent assault. Follouing the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the\ntrial court deemed Cosby to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-\napplicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Act (“SORNA’), 42\nPa.C.S. §§ 9799.lo-9799.4l.

See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions.

As there are parties whose names appear in the grand jury\nexhibits but did not appear in the grand jury transcripts, the Government is undertaking to notify\nsuch parties to the extent their names appear in grand jury exhibits that were not publicly admited\nat the Maxwell trial (and they were not already notified in connection with the request to unseal\nthe grand jury transcripts). The Government respectfully requests to update the Court follouing\nthose notifications by August l4, 2o25, and requests that the Court await that update before\nunsealing any of the grand jury exhibits, to the extent the Court is otherwise inclined to do so.\n\nIn conjunction with this leter, the Government will submit sealed, ex parte submissions\nclarifying which portions of the grand jury exhibits in the Maxwell and Epstein maters have been\nmade public. In making this assessment, the Government has compared the grand jury exhibits\nagainst the trial record and exhibits in the Maxwell trial, as well as against any publicly filed civil\ncomplaints identified by the Government that were filed by certain victims, as explained in further\ndetail in the Government’s sealed, ex parte submissions. !\n\n' Many civil complaints were filed in federal and state courts on behalf of victims identified solely\n\nas “Jane Doe” or by initials that may or may not be the initials of the plaintiffs in those actions,\n\nand therefore the Government cannot atribute with certainty to whom the statements or allegations\n\nin those anonymized complaints can be atributed. If the Government identifies additional\n\nmaterials on public dockets that make such atribution possible, it promptly will notify the Court.\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l3l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015721.jpg": "The Morgan Account\nApplication: Signature Page\nJ.P.

Preska\nAugust lo, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nMs. Maxwell requests a temporary stay of the unsealing process for approximately\nthree weeks until the conclusion of (a) the conferral with the U.S. Atorney’s Office to a\nmodification of the Protective Order in the Criminal Action and, if necessary, an application\nand ruling by Judge Nathan on the issue, to permit the use of the information in this Court and\nbefore the Second Circuit (under seal in both courts, if necessary), (b) an application to this\nCourt containing the new information in support of a request to stay the unsealing process\nuntil the conclusion of the Criminal Action, and (c) a ruling by this Court on the motion for\nstay.\n\nStreamlining of Unsealing Process: As directed by the Court, counsel for Ms. Maxwell\nconferred with plaintiff's counsel concerning various proposals to streamline the unsealing\nprocess. Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations applicable to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have l5 pages to object to the\nfive motions proposed belou, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to\nkeep it shorter than that, but also allou for more space to provide specifics to the Court.\n\nSecond, we have obtained new contact information for Doe l from a separate civil\nsuit.

(“$3286(b)’s use of the terms ‘foreseeable’\nand ‘commission of such offense’ ... dictate a case-specific approach.”’).\n\nIt is noteworthy that the District Court could not identify a single page of\nlegislative history supporting its expansive interpretation of § 3283. But that did\nnot deter it from asserting, without citation to primary authority, that, when\nCongress extended the statute of limitations, it “evinced a general intention to cast\na wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as possible.” Al44. This\nquestionable statement ultimately derives from a Third Circuit opinion, U.S. v.\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5), which itself quotes an Eleventh\nCircuit case, United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo).\nDodge, houever, had nothing to do with § 3283. Instead, Dodge addressed the Sex\nOffender Registration and <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Act (SORNA), a completely different\nstatute passed years after the relevant amendment to § 3283. Worse still, the full\nquote from Dodge is a comment about SORNA’s fext, not its legislative history.\nSee Dodge, 597 F.3d at l355 (“Our review of the language of SORNA confirms our\nconclusion that Congress cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against\nchildren as possible.”) (emphasis added). Thus, the Third Circuit—and, by\nextension, the District Court—grossly misread Dodge and conjured up a legislative\nhistory for § 3283 that does not exist.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extenstve documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested.\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll82", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021185.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye ae 3536o38, Pagel3 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021286.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OND 3536o38, Pagell4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.3! The USAO, with the good faith approval of\nEpstein’s counsel, would select an atorney representative for the victims,\nwhom Epstein would pay.\n\nTiming: Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced\nby October 26, 2oo7. The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “‘anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. !%?\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”'*? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nl3 The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl2 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\ntas On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021287.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3536o38, Pagell5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “TI enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nai The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021295.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document aye Gs 3536o38, Pagel23 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 348\nnot recall for OPR the substance of his conversation with Starr, other than that it was likely about\nEpstein’s wish to have the Department review the case. '”\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution ofa criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“olayed no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nIs In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice. Kept me on the phone\nfor [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.\n95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l295", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021297.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel25 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence .. . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters until this Friday ... to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l297", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021303.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 | 3536o38, Pagel3l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 348\nthese victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\nIX. FEBRUARY - JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.!©? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nto On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillatfafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021306.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ. Ken [Starr]\nand I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to\n\nour seeking appellate review within DOJ.\n\nStarr, Lefkouitz, and Martin Weinberg atended the March l2, 2oo8 meeting, as well as\nthe former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.\nOosterban, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department. The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcern,” including the follouing:\n\n“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; l\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. ‘©\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office .. . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\nl6s In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims. During 2oo7-2oo8, the atorney\n\nlo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021316.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel44 of 258\nSA-l42\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\n\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates .. . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021389.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IBS 3536o38, Page2l7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nI.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\n\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS <span class=\"highlight\">NOTIFICATION</span> PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs US. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n2lo GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021395.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o38, Page223 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters: (l) initial <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.?”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l395", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021396.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 399 3536o38, Page224 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021397.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page225 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 223 of 348\nie U.S. Department of Fustice\nSir Federal Bureau of Investigation\nel : i i FBI - West Palm Beach\nae pl Suite 3oo\nba 5o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) §33-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 28, 2oo6\nRe: Cate Neriter\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Program as being a possible victim of a federal\ncrime.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 356. 3536o38, Page228 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\n\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 - SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021404.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33o 3536o38, Page232 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021406.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page234 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\n\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””° Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\n\nto do the right thing... . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\n\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\n\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\n\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\n\nto do but... it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\n\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\n\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. ... I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM <span class=\"highlight\">NOTIFICATION</span> DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.”°° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\nana Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAQ].”\n\n226 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021408.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 334 3536o38, Page236 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”°”!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°” Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims. I knew that State charges had nothing to do with me.\n3ol Dan Mangan, ““Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,” New York\nPost, Oct. l, 2oo7.

I did not get the opportunity to meet\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\n\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\ncoordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [p]rofessional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°%\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. Ina leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.° The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial... . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\n2o8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. ...

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.”°° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n2o8 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021412.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 338 3536o38, Page24o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.3!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.3!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, in which among other things,\ncae Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021413.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page24l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\na3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021414.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34o 3536o38, Page242 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled.

The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021415.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34l 3536o38, Page243 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021417.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 343 3536o38, Page245 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\n\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\n\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.?”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°*! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater.

Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021421.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 347 3536o38, Page249 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.’329\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”°?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2. The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.°?* The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”?*°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\na3 The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter. OPR reviewed the mater as an inquiry and\ndetermined that no further action was warranted.\nad Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New York\nPost, Jan. 25, 2oo8.\n334 An FBI interview report from May 28, 2oo8, indicates that one victim “believes Epstein should be prosecuted\nfor his actions.”\n\n224\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021426.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 38D 3536o38, Page254 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 252 of 348\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “‘never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”3°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point Ijust felt... like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --.. .\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.**° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\nad Villafafia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l426", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021429.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ER 3536o38, Page25/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 255 of 348\n\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.** The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*#° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”**° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”347 Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\n344 In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (Sth Cir. 2oo8). The Fifth Circuit opinion was not binding precedent in Florida,\nwhich is within the Eleventh Circuit.\ncae United States v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2oo8 WL 5ol32l, at *ll (S.D. Tex. 2oo8). Victims who\nwished to be heard were permited to speak at the plea hearing.\na46 Dean, 527 F.3d at 394.\na Before Epstein’s state court plea hearing, Edwards also began representing the victim who became Jane Doe\n#2, Although OPR focuses on Villafafia’s communications with Edwards in this section, OPR notes that Villafafia\n\n229\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l429", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021433.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page3 of 2l7\nSA-257\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 257 of 348\n\nabout the NPA because it was “confidential” and because the case was under “investigation and\nleading touards” the filing of charges. Villafafia recalled mentioning the conversation to her\nsupervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance\nto us and... could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and\nshould be prosecuted.”\n\nNevertheless, when OPR asked Villafafia why she did not inform Edwards of the same\ninformation that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2oo7 and January 2oo8,\nVillafafia explained that she felt “prohibited”:\n\nAt the time that I spoke with him, you knou, there had been all of\nthis . . . leter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I\nhad been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose\nthings further and not to have any involvement in victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him\nabout the existence of the NPA.\nX. JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”3°! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?°?\n2a Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\nane Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l433", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021435.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA959 3536o39, Paged of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 259 of 348\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.3°’\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the ‘all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”?°* Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nad Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to simply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, sucha\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021436.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA36o 3536o39, Page6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26o of 348\n\nWhen asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea? Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”°°' As she did with prior draft\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*°”\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“Tt]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\nBa) Sloman forwarded the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafia edited it further.\n3l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span>. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n3o2 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l436", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021439.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA 963 3536o39, Page of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 263 of 348\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.*”°\nC. July 2oo8: Villafaia Prepares and Sends a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leter to Listed\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense.

In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.3””\n\nFb In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021453.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page23 of 2l7\nSA-277\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 277 of 348\nl.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021461.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 385 3536o39, Page3l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”*™\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.’*° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.”*°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and ‘“‘we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “‘to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. .. . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest .. ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n4o4 As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\nlo8 Villatafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021462.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SR 386 3536o39, Page32 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’4°\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l462", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021464.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 388 3536o39, Page34 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 288 of 348\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA, The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*'° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.‘! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\nao The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n4d The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\nae Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*\"\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021467.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page37 of 2l7\nSA-29l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29l of 348\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3599 3536o39, Page38 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*\"°\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\n4l6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021469.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 593 3536o39, Page39 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nlagree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*’” Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[alve them the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter... and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> for the\na Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l469", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021470.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 359o4 3536o39, Page4o of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, he nonetheless left responsibility for such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021472.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document “EN 396 3536o39, Page42 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 296 of 348\n\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.47* OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l472", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021473.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3597 | 3536o39, Page43 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\n\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein.

The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes.*?”\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\nae5 Krischer told OPR that the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n426 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process.\nseh Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43(l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation.

Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021475.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER _399 3536o39, Page45 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 299 of 348\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing.

VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.**° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n2o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021477.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3ol 3536o39, Page47 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°3\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and... result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s...\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”*** Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\nBas As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\nBA When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l477", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021478.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page48 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement|,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she ‘“‘was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.**° In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021481.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o5 3536o39, Pagedl of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*?\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021482.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o6 3536o39, Paged2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.**°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l485", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021490.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page6o of 2l7\nSA-3l4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l4 of 348\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained. The USAO’s\ndata was migrated between March and June 2oo8.\n\nEOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any\nadditional emails. OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerning its victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> system.\n\n4. Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included\nthe individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails. CEOS also conducted a check of\nits shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.\n\n5. Office of the Deputy Atorney General Records\n\nOPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the\nformer Deputy Atorney General.

OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o23", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023034.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE: ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS\nA.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\nae State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023124.jpg": "it had identified as victims.'?! The USAO, with the good faith approval of\nEpstein’s counsel, would select an atorney representative for the victims,\nwhom Epstein would pay.\n\nTiming: Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced\nby October 26, 2oo7. The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. *”\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”'°? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l24", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023125.jpg": "this mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl38 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l25", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023133.jpg": "not recall for OPR the substance of his conversation with Starr, other than that it was likely about\nEpstein’s wish to have the Department review the case.!**\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice. Kept me on the phone\nfor [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.\n95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l33", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023135.jpg": "provision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\n\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\nOT\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l35", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023141.jpg": "these victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General.

After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l4l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023144.jpg": "appeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail. ...\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023178.jpg": "3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023203.jpg": "With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.” The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS <span class=\"highlight\">NOTIFICATION</span> PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23232", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023233.jpg": "victim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case.

The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters: (l) initial <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\n2th US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23233", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023234.jpg": "C.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2l3 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023235.jpg": "ieee U.S, Department of Fas lice\nAger n ei Federal Bureau of Tnvesligalion\nie Ei it FB] - West Palm Peach\ncae 5o4 South Magler Drive\nWest Pola Beach.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?’\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\naio OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.jpg": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?””\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\nAaT Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n28 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023238.jpg": "[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or . . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23238", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023242.jpg": "2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”7*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.””°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023243.jpg": "Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n222 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\na3 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023244.jpg": "disagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\n\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\n\ndisagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying\n\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\n\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\n\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’re going\n\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\n\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\n\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM <span class=\"highlight\">NOTIFICATION</span> DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\n\n299 Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23244", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023246.jpg": "involved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, ‘“[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°* Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

I did not get the opportunity to meet\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\ncoordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [p]rofessional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°°\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\n3o3 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. ...

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*% Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n3o5 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23248", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023250.jpg": "NPA.?!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, in which among other things,\n3lo Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2325o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023251.jpg": "she would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\n3l3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2325l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023252.jpg": "the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at —_ a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023253.jpg": "in Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!” Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter . .. and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n3l6 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter.

Regarding issues relevant to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23254", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023255.jpg": "informed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\n\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23258", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023259.jpg": "“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\nPa The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n328 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl28 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\nad Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023262.jpg": "if you heve additional questlans which involve this mater, please contact the office listed above, When\nyou cail, please previde fhe.file number located al the top of this leter, Please remnemder, your participation\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> part of this program is voluntary.

Villafaia, the FBI, and the CEOS Trial Atorney Interview Victims\n\nAs Villafafia resumed organizing the case for charging and trial, the FBI case agent\nprovided Villafafia with a list of “the l9 identified victims we are planning on using in” the federal\ncharges and noted that she and her co-case agent wanted to further evaluate some additional\nvictims.*°° In Washington, D.C., CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to the Epstein case in order to\nbring expertise and “a national perspective” to the mater.*?!\n\nOn January l8, 2oo8, one atorney representing a victim and her family contacted Sloman\nby telephone, stating that he planned to file civil litigation against Epstein on behalf of his clients,\nwho were “frustrated with the lack of progress in the state’s investigation” of Epstein. The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\n\n33l The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter. OPR reviewed the mater as an inquiry and\ndetermined that no further action was warranted.\nas Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New York\nPost, Jan. 25, 2oo8.\n334 An FBI interview report from May 28, 2oo8, indicates that one victim “believes Epstein should be prosecuted\nfor his actions.”\n\n224\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23262", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023264.jpg": "for him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never\ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”**?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --...\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement.

The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\n\n339 Villafafia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023267.jpg": "CVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*44 The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.**° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

Villafafia recalled mentioning the conversation to her\nsupervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance\nto us and... could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and\nshould be prosecuted.”\n\nNevertheless, when OPR asked Villafafia why she did not inform Edwards of the same\ninformation that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2oo7 and January 2oo8,\nVillafafia explained that she felt “prohibited”:\n\nAt the time that I spoke with him, you knou, there had been all of\nthis . . . leter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I\nhad been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose\nthings further and not to have any involvement in victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him\nabout the existence of the NPA.\nX. JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”*>! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?~?\n\n33l Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23269", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023271.jpg": "[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.**”\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°* Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\n357 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document), the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2327l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023272.jpg": "When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “‘was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea.*°° Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”*°! As she did with prior draft\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“It]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafa edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span>. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023275.jpg": "no federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.*”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023276.jpg": "l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out. Do you have a lawyer? Get name or address. If not[,]\nwhere do you want [the] leter sent? If you have questions when\nyou receive the leter, please understand that we cannot provide\nlegal advice but the lawyers at the follouing victim rights\norganizations are able to help you at no cost to you. (Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\na7 A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23276", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023277.jpg": "leter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE.

In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?””\n\n3l6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23278", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023289.jpg": "l.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8.

OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into ... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . .

[I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n‘we As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23297", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023298.jpg": "Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].”\"”\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.

During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\nal The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nal2 Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*!?\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.jpg": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023303.jpg": "IV.

The USAO initially\n\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\n\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023304.jpg": "strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments.

The draft victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023305.jpg": "Thereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing.

OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\na9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, he nonetheless left responsibility for such <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023308.jpg": "the PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.**4 OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023309.jpg": "investigation.

The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *”7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> process.\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter.

For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short.

This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘2S As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023314.jpg": "not plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing.

Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n485 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023317.jpg": "and they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).“44 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n48 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. lV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> of the victim <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023318.jpg": "intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.jpg": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia.

OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

The SHU Lieutenant, whose shift\nended over an hour before the USMS sent the second email regarding Inmate 3's impending transfer, told\nthe OIG he was not aware that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred out of MCC New York, and\ntherefore he did not notify the Captain that Epstein would require a new cellmate. According to the SHU\nLieutenant, as soon as the SHU staff learned that Inmate 3 would be transferred, they should have notified a\nLieutenant on duty. The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the\nOIG that on August 9, 2ol9, they had oversight of the SHU from approximately 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. due to\ntheir position descriptions and because of the SHU Lieutenant’s absence.\nAccording to the MCC New York Staff Roster, on August 9, 2ol9, SHU Officer #l was listed as Senior Officer\nSpecialist 5. Although SHU Officer #l is typically the Officer in Charge, another Senior Officer Specialist told\nthe OIG that, in actuality, he was the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 from approximately\n6 a.m. until 2 p.m. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that since he had the most experience and\nseniority, he was considered by everyone to be the SHU Officer in Charge, which the SHU Lieutenant\nconfirmed. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a\ncellmate. He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or\npsychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant\nhad instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge, between July 3o and August 9, 2ol9, he told all other MCC New York staff members\nwho worked in the SHU of Epstein’s cell mate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in\nthe SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knouledge, training,\nand experience.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, the SHU staff\nreceived an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as “WAB,” which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was\nbeing removed from MCC New York. He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted\nEpstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time\nEpstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were\naccompanied by CO l, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge and CO l both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his\nbelongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that\nhe would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a\ncellmate. In his interview with the OIG, CO l confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications\nmade either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge.

So,\nmaybe he spoke to [Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe | was standing there, and he thought | heard\nhim.” The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC New York with all of his\nbelongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him because Epstein was required\nto have a cellmate.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023425.jpg": "he did not knou that Inmate 3 was removed from MCC New York on August 9, and that Epstein was without\na cellmate during his shift on August lo.\nIV. Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023463.jpg": "the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier\nof the SHU.\nWe also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shoun in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in\nplain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements,\nincluding into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,\nunbeknounst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that\ntime. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health.

The fact that these failures have\nbeen recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and\nrelated problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DOJ personnel have commited misconduct.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate.

Good judgment and common sense are\nexpected in all situations not covered in these post orders.”\nOn August 9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and CO\nTova Noel were each assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their permanent quarterly assigned post and\nserved as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts.°? The OIG investigation found that each\nof these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times per the Psychology\nDepartment's directive.\nThe OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, and Noel each became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein’s\ncellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status knoun to all\nMCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the\ninstitution. Specifically, the OIG investigation found that on the morning of August 9, the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and CO l, who was also assigned to the SHU, reviewed the MCC New York daily call out list,\na document that identifies all inmates who were leaving their housing units each day, which listed Inmate 3\nas being scheduled to depart MCC New York with all of his belongings. At approximately 8:3o a.m., CO l\nescorted Inmate 3 from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge to be transferred out of the institution, and the\nDay Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for his\ndaily meeting with his atorneys. During the escort, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO l\ndiscussed the need to assign Epstein with a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer.© The Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge told the OIG, and stated in a memorandum that he prepared follouing Epstein’s death,\nthat he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new\ncellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified Lieutenant. Houever, the OIG did not credit the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge’s account because no other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in\nfact passed on information regarding Epstein’s need for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.\n6 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n62 TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n6 Noel served as the SHU Officer in Charge after the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s shift ended at lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9.\n6 Receiving and Discharge is the area of MCC New York that is responsible for processing inmates who enter or leave\nthe facility.\n6 The OIG did not find that CO l failed to make appropriate notifications because his immediate superior in his chain-\nof-command, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, was aware of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\n\n99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023467.jpg": "The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHU, both the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate.

Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none of these\nindividuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required.

Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was housed without a cellmate at the time of his death. Rather\nthan passively relying on a <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span> from subordinates, supervisory personnel also had an obligation\nunder federal regulations to “put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties,” which included\nsupervision of SHU personnel.®” The OIG's investigation revealed that the Captain and the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, and\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, among other MCC New York staff, received an email from the\nU.S. Marshals Service (USMS) on August 8, 2ol9, notifying them that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be\ntransferred to another facility the follouing day. If any of these supervisors had read the email atachment,\nthey would have knoun of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.

Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch.

Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida.

Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years.

The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate.

SHU meetings. morning meetings, and close out\nmeetings.\nWhen inmates are placed on and off suicide watch. the Warden is notified verbally, regardless of the time of day.\nThe Warden then determines which suicide watch area a suicidal inmate will be housed and if they will be observed\nwith an inmate companions or a staff member.\nBS\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25ll4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025123.jpg": "Page 76l\nthe correct cell assignment noted. The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.\nMoreover, the four suicide watch cells nou all have SENTRY Assignments of HoOl-oolL —HOol-oo4L. Further,\nPsychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants\nhave conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly\nrounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the selection category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said <span class=\"highlight\">notification</span>. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of\nthis determination.\nTo ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks\nare conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP3o Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.\nExecutive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.\nResults will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and\nresponsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff.

Follouing that, he held a\nnumber of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at\nBear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknoun policy violations in l98l. He also worked as a\nfinancial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.\nMr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a\nconsultant wit the late l98os. pee age described as his\nfirst mentor. as later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi\nscheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his oun\npersonal use. Years later Or Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company,\ngranted him pouer of atorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and <span class=\"highlight\">Notification</span> Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027295.jpg": "Fwd: Re: Epstein investigation\nTo Charisma Edge\nDate 2ol9/o8/lo l6:2o\nSubject: Fwd: Re: Epstein investigation\nAtachments: TEXT. htm, mltC634.pdf\nNo problem.

I atempted to interview her\nabout Jeffrey Epstein. She advised she is so in love with Jeff ,\nEpstein and would do anything for him. She further explained that she\nwould not speak with us about him either negative or positive. She.\nasked us to leave her property. I informed her that although she did\nnot wish to speak with us, I had sufficient information at this point\nin the investigation to knou she was at Epstein's house and provided\ngirls to Epstein to work.
