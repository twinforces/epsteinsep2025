I was told by a booker that I needed to meet\n\n7 with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was the ouner of\n\n8 Victoria's Secret. The booker told me that Mr. Epstein could\n\n9 help me get into Victoria Secret's world.\n\nlo It was my childhood dream to be a Victoria's Secret\n\nll model. So I went one day in the afternoon and I met\n\nl2 Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York. A woman\nl3 introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be\n\nl4 extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would\nl5 probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away.\nl6 The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey\nl7 Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we\n\nl8 chated very briefly. I had my <span class=\"highlight\">portfolio</span> of photos, but he\n\nl9 didn't even look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got\n2o close to me. I got up to leave, but the door was locked.\n2l I didn't knou what was going on. It was my first\n22 official meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a\n23 young girl and confused. He got very close to me, and I had a\n24 skirt on. He started to touch my genitals. I refused him.\n25 Then he went to the massage table and shoued me the vibrator.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo722", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002084.jpg": "2o-cr- - ocument 97-l9 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of5\nSC\npF\na —\nLe\npo\nee\n\nSTATEMENT OF Rs SECURITY CONSULTANT\n\nl. |, a. served for 25 years in the United Kingdom military. For l5 of those years, I\nserved in the United Kingdom Special Forces. I have worked in the security industry for ten\nyears and have gained a level 6 Security Risk Management Consultants (SRMC) qualification,\nworking touards a master’s degree in Risk Management. I hold numerous instructional and\noperational licenses qualifying me to deliver several types of security services under the UK\nSecurity Industry Authority, including a certification to provide close protection services for\nindividuals facing physical threats. I am a member of the Academy of Security Intelligence and\nRisk Studies and have ouned and operated security companies in all capacities in a number of\ndifferent countries.\n\n2. As part of my security <span class=\"highlight\">portfolio</span>, I have secured global assets and have protected numerous high\nvalue persons. As an example, I was contracted to guard the UKs third richest person,\naccording to Forbes, after he broke his agreed bail conditions with another consultant. Under\nmy protection never escaped again and completed his high-profile court appearances to\ncessation.\n\n3. Ihave provided security consultation and services for the Maxwell family for a number of years\nin both the United Kingdom and United States. I provided security services for Ghislaine\nMaxwell from approximately July 2ol9 through up to the time of her arrest on July 2, 2o2o.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell faced a number of security issues. For example, I was aware that she received a\nnumber of death threats connected to her relationship with Jeffery Epstein some 2o years\npreviously. She was also the target of aggressive behavior by members of the press who were\ntrying to achieve a ‘scoop.’ This kind of behavior is not only harassing, but can be life\nthreatening. A good example is the case of Princess Diana, who unfortunately lost her life due to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo _ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 2 of 32\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\n=\" On Sunday, guards initially refused to allou Ms. Maxwell to bring a notebook to a\nscheduled in-person legal conference, disbelieving her assertion that it contained legal\nmaterial. A guard reviewed the contents of the notebook, reading pages containing\nconfidential and privileged work product, before permiting Ms. Maxwell to bring the\nnotebook to the legal visit.\n\n= Contrary to previous legal conferences, neither counsel nor Ms. Maxwell were permited\nto have any water in the individual conference room during Sunday’s four-hour legal\nconference.\n\n= Three to six guards watched Ms. Maxwell and counsel for the entirety of the conference.\n\n= Neither counsel nor Ms. Maxwell were permited to use the most rudimentary of earbuds\nto listen to audio files on counsel’s laptop, requiring the volume to be raised to maximum\nlevel. Ms. Maxwell cannot have privileged communications with her counsel and\nadequately prepare for trial if the prison guards can hear what she is reviewing and\ndiscussing with counsel.\n\n= The prison guards ordered counsel to reposition her <span class=\"highlight\">portfolio</span>, which was being used to\nshield glare from the plexiglass divider separating counsel from Ms. Maxwell to permit\ncounsel to have a clearer view of the laptop, because the <span class=\"highlight\">portfolio</span> was restricting the\nguards’ view of counsel.\n\n= At one point, a prison guard interrogated counsel about what she was doing with her\nhands. (Counsel was bloting a bleeding finger with note paper.)\n\n» At the conclusion of Sunday’s legal visit, counsel requested that the guards inventory Ms.\nMaxwell’s documents in the presence of counsel to avoid the problem that ensued\nfollouing the April 24\" visit when counsel was falsely accused of improperly leaving\ndocuments with Ms. Maxwell.\n\n= Yesterday, the monitor which has been used for video conferencing for months was\nrepositioned to a distance further away from Ms. Maxwell impacting her ability to review\nscreen-shared documents with counsel. The request was immediately denied.\n\n= Today’s videoconferencing was reduced by 9o minutes while changes were made to\nMDC equipment. These changes have disrupted videoconferencing, which had been\nworking well, and nou severely impact atorney-client communication and the ability to\nprepare the case for trial. On counsel's end, the audio is impacted by a whirling, whistling\nsound - like water going doun a drain. The video is completely blurred, causing eye\nstrain, and compromising the sharing of documents, which are too hazy to decipher.\n\nOn the MDC end, the audio is loud and echoes, making it difficult to understand and\naudible to staff, compromising atorney-client confidentiality. The monitor- nou enclosed\nin a box with a plastic cover - is nou positioned some three to four feet away from Ms.\nMaxwell. This distance impacts Ms. Maxwell’s ability to view screen-shared\ndocuments and requires her to contort her body - back and neck - and risk further injury\nwhile atempting to see shared legal documents.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4745", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 48 of lo6 52\nLBTCMAX2 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl radiated what's called a halo effect.

He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct\nanswer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of IQ.”\nA Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to\nmake connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is\nextremely smart and probing.

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling <span class=\"highlight\">portfolio</span> before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge pom is\nmen with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

This guy plays 26 hours a day.”\nThose who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind\ngoes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from\nmathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct\nanswer in the shortest period of time, That’s my definition of IQ.”\nA Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to\nmake connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is\nextremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also\nto identify biological problems without having ali the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an\nextremely short atention span. Why?-—it’s not that he’s bored. He has enough information after fifteen\nhtn://Awww.vrinthis.clickability.com/nt/cpt?action=cpte&title= The+Fantasist&expiresGurl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 23 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o62", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032065.jpg": "The Fantasist sae OR\nEpstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling <span class=\"highlight\">portfolio</span> before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge porn is\nmen with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\nHis claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like\nyoung women.’ ~ '\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the\nhtn://www.printhis.clickabilitv.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 26 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032362.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 77\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nNA Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH l/3o/o6\nEntered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. l/3o/o6\nOn January 25, 2oo6, Det Caristo and I, responded to\nBEE 223 net vith tated last\nyear, when she was seventeen years of age, she met Jeffrey Epstein\nthrough her former room mate Dana Burns.
