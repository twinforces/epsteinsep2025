Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defendant’s Motion for\nPretrial Release (the “Release Motion’), dated July ll, 2ol9 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (the “Detention Memo”), submited to Magistrate Judge\nPitman on July 8, 2ol9, which is atached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that classification louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000345.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page3oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nAs has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he ouns and\nmaintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhatan, New York;\nPalm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein ouns a\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary\nresidence in the United States. His mansion in Manhatan alone—a multi-story tounhouse\nreported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhatan, which previously housed a\nschool and which he ouns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.\nEntities controlled by the defendant also oun at least two private jets in active service, at least one\nof which is capable of intercontinental travel.\n\nAs described further belou, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,\nand his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to\nmaintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past l8 months alone, the\ndefendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately\nmore than 2o occasions.\n\nC. The Prior Florida Investigation\n\nIn or about 2oo5, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in\nconnection with allegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\nconnection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\nidentified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the conclusion of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district.

And, it comes into pay only after Mr. Epstein has |\nfled the Court’s jurisdiction.

The Government also contends that “[i]n light of the strength of the Government’s |\nevidence and the substantial incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction [45 |\nyears], there is an extraordinary risk of flight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant :\nwealth, his ounership of and access to private planes capable of international travel, and his\nsignificant international ties.” Id.\nThe Government also provides the follouing background information: “In or about 2oo5,\nthe defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in connection with :\nallegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The investigation\nultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\n| District of Florida and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews with victims based in the\nPalm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count One of the instant\nIndictment. In the fall of 2oo7, the Defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”)\nwith the Southern District of Florida in connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation,\nwhich the non-prosecution agreement identified as including investigations into the defendant’s\nabuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach area.” Id. at 3. “In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in\n[Florida] state court to one count of procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a\nfelony, and one count of solicitation of prostitution, [also] a felony. As a result, the defendant :\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as a sex offender with registration requirements under the national Sex Offender\nRegistration and Notification Act.” Id.\nThe Defense moved on July ll, 2ol9, for pretrial release of Mr. Epstein, arguing that\n“Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various monitoring requirements associated with his\nsex-offender registration actually decrease[s] any danger that he might otherwise pose” and also\nthat “Mr. Epstein has never once atempted to flee the United States.”’ Dkt. 6 at l, l2.

This is not the Court’s function. See\nUnited States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6) (“The [bail |\npackage] . . . proposed by the defense is not reasonable because, in too many respects, it |\nsubstitutes judicial oversight and management for (more appropriate) reliance upon trained,\nexperienced, and qualified professionals from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals |\nService.”). The Defense package components would embroil the Court in issues, among others, |\nrelating to the level of force that may be used to secure the Defendant, who may enter the |\nresidence, daily reporting by Mr. Epstein, and reporting by so-called Trustee(s) <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> to live |\nwith and supervise Mr. Epstein. See United States v. Valerio, 9 F.

And, it comes into pay only after Mr. Epstein has |\nfled the Court’s jurisdiction. According to the Government, “The Department of Justice’s Office |\nof International Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an |\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a |\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.” Dkt. l] at 7. |\n(4) Although the Defense has stated that Mr. Epstein would be agreeable to puting up :\n“any amount” of collateral or signing “any bond” the Court would require, there has, to date, |\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo8l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000822.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document 4-2, o7/23/2ol9, 26l468l, Paged of 8\nEmail: alison.moe@usdoj.gov\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Assistant US Atorney\nMaurene Ryan Comey\nUnited States Atorney's Office, SDNY\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\n(2l2)-637-2324\nEmail: maurene.comey@usdoj.gov\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Assistant US Atorney\n\nDate Filed\n\no7/o2/2ol9 2 |SEALED INDICTMENT as to Sealed Defendant | (l) count(s) l, 2.

This Opinion is provided pursuant to instructions from Peters and Peters Solicitors LLP’ dated l2\nAugust 2o2o in the context of bail proceedings relating to Ms Ghislaine Maxwell before the United\nStates District Court, Southern District of New York. Subsequent instructions have confirmed that Ms\nMaxwell will execute a waiver of her right to extradition that could be exhibited to a future extradition\nrequest made by the United States and relied upon in any extradition proceedings. The specific\nquestions asked by Peters and Peters are atached at Annex A. A summary of counsel’s relevant\nexperience is atached at Annex B. The waiver is atached at Annex C.\n\n2. Insummary:\n\n(a) Extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom are governed by the Extradition Act 2oo3\n(‘the 2oo3 Act’) and, in general, comprise; (i) a hearing before a <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> ‘appropriate\nJudge’ (the extradition hearing); and (i) an appeal, subject to a leave requirement.\n\n(b) In proceedings under the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may consent to their extradition\nwhich has the effect of removing the need for an extradition hearing and waiving the\nperson’s statutory appeal rights.\n\n(c) In the majority of cases, proceedings in England and Wales in relation to US extradition\nrequests are concluded in under two years’. The process is significantly shorter if the\nrequested person consents to their extradition and in those cases the timescales are\napproximately between one and three months.\n\n(d) It is extremely unlikely that bail would be granted in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United States\nprior to trial and in breach of bail.\n\n' The follouing documents were annexed to the instructions: (a) Superseding Indictment, United States v Ghislaine\nMaxwell, dated 8 July 2o2o; (b) a transcript of the arraignment and bail hearing that took place on l4 July 2o2o; (c) the\nMotion to Detain the Defendant dated 2 July 2o2o; (d) the Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion for Detention dated\nlo July 2o2o; (e) and the Government Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention dated l3 July 2o2o.\n° There is no data as to the duration of extradition proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland but it may be inferred\nthat the timescales are similar.\nl922623.l\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o97", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page 4 of 29\nA. Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United States\nThe extradition arrangements\n\n3. Extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America are governed by\nan extradition treaty signed on 3l March 2oo3°, which is given effect in the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom‘ by the 2oo3 Act”.\n\nOverview of the extradition process\n\n4. The United States of America has been <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom. The Act applies in the three\njurisdictions within the United Kingdom: (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; and (c) Northern Ireland. There are\nlimited regional variations of which the only one of relevance to this Opinion is that the forum bar in s. 83A of the 2oo3\nAct (see para.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s order dated\nJanuary 26, 2o2l providing the Government with an opportunity to respond to the defendant’s\nproposed redactions to its pre-trial motions filed on January 25, 2o2l. The Government notes at\nthe outset that the defendant has not proposed any redactions to certain motions filed on the docket.\n(Motions 5, 8, 9, & l2; Dkts. ll9-l26). The Government agrees that no redactions are necessary\nas to those particular motions. The Government agrees with the defendant’s proposed redactions\nto the remaining pre-trial motions for the follouing reasons:\n\ne The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss for breach of the non-\nprosecution agreement (Motion l) and the motion to dismiss for pre-indictment\ndelay (Motion 7) refer to documents <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> by the Government as\n“Confidential” within the meaning of the Protective Order in this case (see\nProtective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36)), and the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the integrity of the Government’s ongoing investigation. See, e.g.,\nDouglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979) (“Since\nthe l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records\nof such proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury\nsecrecy... is an integral part of our criminal justice system.’’).\n\ne The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts One through\nFour of the Superseding Indictment as time-barred (Motion 2) and her motion to\nstrike surplusage from the Superseding Indictment (Motion 6) protect the privacy\ninterests of victim-witnesses.\n\ne The proposed redactions to the motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six (Motion 4)\nrefer to documents <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> by the Government as “Confidential” within the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\nthis proposal, and it was never included in the Protective Order. Ex. A.” To the contrary, the\norder strictly limited the parties’ disposition of Confidential Material, including at the conclusion\nof the case. In particular, paragraph l2 of the order provided that:\n\n[a]t the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each\n\ndocument and all copies thereof which have been <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as CONFIDENTIAL\n\nshall be returned to the party that <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties\n\nmay elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents.

In support of the\nmotion, Boies Schiller assured the district court that “[s]uch questions are entirely appropriate in\nthe discovery phase of this case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as\nconfidential under the Protective Order in this case.”\n\n* This proposal was rejected because of justifiable concerns about the misuse and abuse of this\ninformation by plaintiff and her lawyers including the selection and misleading leaking of confidential\nmaterial to the media, other false claimants, and the government.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2356", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002373.jpg": "GeaSell2 sce MOFABARW SP QOURIRREABE2] FilKedORzIOHS!

Requests | through 5 all\nseek “communications” between “You” and a <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> individual or entity, including the U.S.\nAtorney and BSF’s co-counsel, about a certain subject.

Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, :\n364 (2d Cir. l948); see Jury Plan. Accordingly, the rationale justifying this territorial division is |\nbased on administrative feasibility. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *l,\nWith this background in mind, the legal issue at hand becomes straightforward. The :\nSecond Circuit’s decision in United States v. Bahna, 68 F.3d l9 (2d Cir. l995), frames the\ninquiry and supplies its answer. In Bahna, a defendant was indicted, tried, and convicted of :\n: various narcotics crimes in the Eastern District of New York’s Brooklyn courthouse. /d. at 2o. |\nBut follouing his initial trial, the defendant was granted a new trial. /d. Saliently, the\ndefendant’s second trial occurred before a different judge and in a different venue—the Eastern :\nDistrict’s Uniondale courthouse.° Id. :\nOf concern here, the defendant raised a fair cross-section challenge follouing his second |\nconviction. Id, at 23-24. Under the Eastern District’s jury plan, the Brooklyn courthouse drew\njurors from all of the counties within the Eastern District, while the Uniondale courthouse only\ndrew from Nassau and Suffolk counties. See id. at 24. Accordingly, the defendant argued that\nthe Uniondale courthouse’s jury wheel underrepresented African American and Hispanic\nAmerican jurors in comparison to their demographics in the relevant community—which he\nalleged to be all of the counties making up the Eastern District. Id.\nThe Second Circuit, houever, rejected that reasoning and held that, “Where a jury venire\nis drawn from a properly <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> division, we look to that division to see whether there has\n5 The trial court stated that the reason for the transfer “was to accommodate trial congestion in\nthe court’s calendar during a period of judicial emergency in the Eastern District.” Soares v.\nUnited States, 66 F.

(emphasis added). And in :\napplying this principle, the Bahna court concluded that the correct community was not the entire |\nEastern District, but the two counties—Nassau and Suffolk—comprising the Uniondale\ncourthouse. Id. Thus because there was no underrepresentation shoun between the Uniondale |\njury wheel (e.g. the jury venire) and the Uniondale counties (e.g. the community), the court |\nrejected the defendant’s fair cross-section challenge. Id. |\n\nJust as Bahna rejected the proposition that the relevant community was the entire Eastern |\nDistrict, this Court also rejects Schulte’s contention that the relevant community is the\nManhatan counties or the entire District. See id. Because Schulte’s grand jury venire was\ndrawn from White Plains, Bahna instructs the Court to “look to that division” as the relevant |\ncommunity in assessing his fair cross-section challenge. See id. The Court must therefore |\nconclude that the White Plains counties represent the relevant community.\n\nThere is one caveat. The precursor to applying Bahna, of course, is that it must have |\nbeen proper for the Government to have sought the Indictment from White Plains. 68 F.3d at 24 . :\n(“Where a jury venire is drawn from a properly <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> division, we look to that division to |\nsee whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.”) (emphasis\nadded). And on this issue, Schulte contends that the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains “deviated from the established, court-tested, and constitutional\npractice of indicting defendants in the division in which the offenses allegedly occurred and in\nwhich the case will be tried.” (Schulte Br. at 2.) This argument must be rejected for two\nreasons.\n\nFirst, the Court finds no persuasive or binding authority that supports the premise that the\nGovernment must indict defendants in the same courthouse as where the trial is scheduled to\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2832", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002838.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOnouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafad¢? bf 26 2o\nalleged exclusion here (e.g. people moving) is an external force.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658. |\nAccordingly, this argument must be rejected under Rioux.\" See id. |\nIn sum, Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements under Duren.\nAccordingly, his fair cross-section challenge under the Sixth Amendment and J SSA must be\nrejected. |\ni. Equal Protection Challenge :\nSchulte next contends that the underrepresentation of African American and Hispanic\nAmerican jurors violates the Equal Protection clause under the Fifth Amendment. (Schulte Br. at | |\nl6-l7.) As noted above, the Equal Protection clause forbids the exclusion of racial minorities\nfrom grand and petit juries. Castaneda, 43o U.S. at 492. But to establish a prima facie violation\nof equal protection, Schulte must furnish “proof of discriminatory intent.” United States v.\nBiaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o). Because Schulte cannot make such a shouing, his 2\nEqual Protection challenge fails. His only contention on this element is that the\nunderrepresentation of African Americans and Hispanic Americans “cannot be the result of\n° Under New York law, voters are <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> “inactive” when a “County Board received\ninformation indicating that a voter may no longer be living at her address of registration.”\n\n- Common Cause/New York v. Brehm, 432 F. Supp.3d 285, 29o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (examining New\nYork voting law). |\nlo The Court is unpersuaded by Schulte’s remaining allegations of systematic exclusion, which\nare that (l) jurors drawn from the overlapping counties were inequitably prorated between the :\ntwo courthouses, and (2) a technical glitch in the White Plains master wheel excluded jurors who )\nhad provided an alternative address when registering to vote. As to the former claim, Schulte has\nnot shoun that this alleged error caused the underrepresentation at issue. See Allen, 2o2l WL |\n43l458, at *ll (finding same error to have had “minimal” effect on venires). And as to the later |\nclaim, the parties concede that this glitch actually augmented, not diminished, African American\nand Hispanic American representation in the White Plains master wheel.

As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3242", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset.

FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\n<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”** Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7®°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.*”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?”7\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofll\nwhich effectuates the Sixth Amendment right to a fair cross-section, notes that the relevant\n“community” is “the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.” 28\nU.S.C. § l86l.

The government points to the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> division, we look to\nthat division to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of\nminorities.” Opp. 2ol (quoting Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24) (emphasis added by government).

The Requests Are Not Specific.\n\nThe Defendant has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that Requests l through 5—\nfor a broad range of communications between BSF and others about the Defendant and gy\nWm —clear Nixon’s hurdles of relevancy, admissibility, and specificity. See United States v.\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 7oo (l974). As to specificity, Maxwell first argues that Requests l through\n5 are sufficiently specific because they “are specific as to date and limited by the identified\nindividuals and subject mater.” Resp. Ltr. at 2. But the specificity hurdle requires more. “In order\nto avoid speculation that the moving party is using Rule l7(c) to circumvent normal discovery\nrequirements, the party’s Rule l7(c) subpoena must be able to reasonably specify the information\ncontained or believed to be contained in the documents sought rather than merely hope that\nsomething useful will turn up.” United States v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, “[r]equests for any and all\ncommunications, even if tied to specific documents and topics, are potentially ‘fishing expeditions’\nfor unspecified materials and insufficiently specific under United States v.

United States Atorney’s\noffice in any capacity between 2ol5 and the date of this subpoena about yg.” Thus,\ndue to their expansive definitions, the Defendant’s requests are even broader than those that Judge\nGardephe rejected in Avenati, which were limited to identified individuals.? Requests l through\n5 of the subpoena thus fail Nixon’s specificity requirement.\n3 The Defendant contends that Requests l through 5 are similar to those approved by the\ncourt in United States v.

As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 67 of 349\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 68 of 349\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She percetved that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l53 of 349\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v.

The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset.

FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\n<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23o of 349\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.””* Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7°°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.”*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4527", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 267 of 349\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.3”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?””\n\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4564", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page3of2l\n\nFollouing entry of the protective order, Maxwell testified in two depositions in the civil\ncase.

Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the interaction between the former district atorney and Cosby to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d.

See id.\n§ 5947(b) (“The Atorney General or a district atorney may request an immunity order\nfrom any judge of a <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> court.”). Because D.A. Castor did not seek such\npermission, and instead acted of his oun volition, the trial court concluded that any\npurported immunity offer was defective, and thus invalid. Consequently, according to the\ntrial court, the “press release, signed or not, was legally insufficient to form the basis of\nan enforceable promise not to prosecute.” T.C.O. at 62.\n\nThe trial court also found that “Mr. Castor’s testimony about what he did and hou\nhe did it was equivocal at best.” /d. at 63.

The Superior Court\nadded that the trial court did not err in determining that the probative value of this evidence\noutweighed its potential for unfair prejudice, inasmuch as, “in a vacuum, Cosby’s use and\ndistribution of a then-legal ‘party drug’ nearly half a century ago did not appear highly\nprejudicial,” and “only becomes significantly prejudicial, and fairly so, when, in the context\nof other evidence, it establishes Cosby's knouledge of and familiarity with central nervous\nsystem depressants for purposes of demonstrating that he was at least reckless” in giving\nConstand such a drug before having sexual contact with her. /d. at 42o-2l (emphasis in\noriginal) (cleaned up).

Like the trial court, the\npanel found no “authority suggesting that a district atorney ‘may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. at 4ll (quoting\nT.C.O. at 62). Therefore, the court opined, “it is clear on the face of the record that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there was no enforceable non-\nprosecution agreement in this case.” /d. The court added: “Even assuming Mr. Castor\npromised not to prosecute [Cosby], only a court order can convey such immunity.

From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and Cosby was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b). Presented with such a request, the petitioned court “shall issue\nsuch an order,” id., upon which a witness “may not refuse to testify based on his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.” /d. § 5947(c). At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide Cosby with transactional immunity.

(See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2o of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\n\nabsence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from\n\na grand jury’s scrutiny.

See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal.

When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\n<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited).

Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9) ([under Civil Rule l2], “the district court may strike such\nmaterial from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or\nscandalous.” Because such rejected or stricken material is not “relevant to the\nperformance of the judicial function” it would not be considered a “judicial document”\nand would enjoy no presumption of public access.”).\n\nThe Second Circuit established a framework in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6) for courts to utilize in determining when the\npublic has a right of access to particular documents. The Court of Appeals held that\n“Tb]efore any such common law right can atach, houever, a court must first conclude\nthat the documents at issue are indeed ‘judicial documents.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9.\n“Once the court has determined that the documents are judicial documents and that\ntherefore a common law presumption of access ataches, it must determine the weight of\nthat presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the weight of the presumption of\naccess, the court must ‘balance competing considerations against it.’” Jd. at l2o.\n\nThere exists no compelling reason to release Juror No. 5o’s pleadings. Any public\nrelease of the documents will set off another round of publicity, speculation, and\ncommentary, all of which ls prejudicial to the truth finding process and Ms. Maxwell’s\nrights to fair and impartial proceedings.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9754", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010130.jpg": "CaSas i2o2 Or RCRGeD AS NL Dement Ge?

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\n<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n- 3 See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR- oool9334", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019406.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 6o, o9/24/2o2o, 2938278, Page7 of 58\n\nMs. Maxwell sat for two depositions during discovery in Giuffre v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\n\nApp.o9o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9549", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019567.jpg": "Came POBO OOBBoAIeht DOCOURBATAL o Fd S7o2 )289 ch aged HSB\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell agreed to\nthat limitation after assurances by the government, consistent with their representation to this\nCourt, that “the Government rarely provides any third party, including a witness, with any\nmaterial they did not already possess,” and therefore “concerns defense counsel raises about\nfuture use in civil litigation are not likely to occur.” Leter of Alex Rossmiller at 6 (Doc. # 33)\n(July 28, 2o2o).

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021240.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N66 3536o38, Page68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section I.B.l.\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021241.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page69 of 258\nSA-67\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021243.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N6o 3536o38, Page/l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 348\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\n\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting.® Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\nSF Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\n68 Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021326.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ED 3536o38, Pagel54 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !°°\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nlS The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021396.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 399 3536o38, Page224 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\n<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021403.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 359 | 3536o38, Page23l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\n\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**° Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.”\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Tals Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case... is the victims.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that ‘you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.?*’\n\n28 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n\n2o3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021442.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 366 3536o39, Pagel2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\n\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.?”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.3””\n\nFb In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021644.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON AGS 3536o39, Page2l4 of 2l7\n99\nM6s2Max2\n\nl probation department.

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2 Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023078.jpg": "Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023079.jpg": "In light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atomey, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023081.jpg": "on the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting.®® Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n&? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerms they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nee Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o8l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023164.jpg": "prosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v.

Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v.

The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described.

In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court.

For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein.

Inmate Designations\nThe majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates\nwho, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another\ninstitution. Houever, an inmate is not transported to a new\ninstitution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court\nmust first provide to the USMS the final presentence\ninvestigation report and a signed judgement and commitment order.\nThe USMS must then forward these documents along with a request\nfor designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation\nCenter (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve 4a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\n<span class=\"highlight\">designated</span>, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024007.jpg": "lo:oo.

He provided a business card and provided\nhis assistance with the investigation.\nDue to Hurricane Wilma, which struck the southeast of South Florida\ncausing massive pouer outages, the courthouse was closed due to the\nlack of pouer.

I was instructed\nby Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media\nrelated material from the residence.\nUpon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as\nthe Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the\nleft side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware siting on floor\nnext to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or\nfeatures indicating a make or model. This CPU was pouered off with\nthe pouer cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the\nCPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,\nprinter, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I\nobserved an A/V card with RCA jacks atached. This type of hardware\nwould allou audio and video to be dounloaded onto the CPU s hard disk.\nThe ends of the RCA jacks were unatached at the time of the search\nand no external camera was located within this room.\nThe CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel\nLCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative\nof a second computer; houever, no other computer was found. It\nappeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the\ncables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same\narea. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,\ni.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is\ncommonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media\nwas found.\n| After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned\nall items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis\nvia a property receipt.\nI was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as the Garden\nRoom, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a\nflat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and\nprinter; houever, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed\nfrom an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk\narea revealed no signs of any media devices.\nDet. Recarey directed me to a third location <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as the Cabana\nroom, which is detached from the residence and located just south of\nthe pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office\ntype seting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,\nkeyboard, mouse and printer; houever, no CPU was located. All of the\ncables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A\nsearch of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.\no7/26/l7 Page 2o35 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032349.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 64\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\n\nDet. Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the\n\nSouth East corner of the property. This area of this structure was\n\nassigned with single leters to identify a particular part of the\n\nroom. In the office area, <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as Room B, I observed a pouered\n\non Dell Dimension 235o, atached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The\n\nscreen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer brouser with URL\n\naddress of htp://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active\n\nwindous in the Start panel windou and photographed screen. The pouer\n\ncord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the\n\ncable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,\n\nmarked with Serial Number 6WTVN2l, was secured and turned over the\n\nevidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt.\n\nI also located several media related items within Room B, which were\nrecorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence\n\nCustodians.\n\nI then responded to a Bedroom <span class=\"highlight\">designated</span> as Room F, where I observed a\n\nwhite in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer\n\ndesk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were pouered on.\n\nThe CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,\n\nwarning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active\n\nwindous in the Start panel windou and photographed screen. I removed\n\nthe pouer cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdoun all other\n\nmedia. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2oooo9lo78, was\n\nsecured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic\n\nanalysis via property receipt.

It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,\nprinter, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I\nobserved an A/V card with RCA jacks atached.
