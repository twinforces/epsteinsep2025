Nor was she provided any soap or any disinfectant to wash her hands, in\ndisregard of CDC pandemic protocols. When she caught a few minutes of sleep in the holding\ncell, a marshal jabbed her in the leg to get her atention.® She is already sleep deprived. Should\nshe be subjected to these conditions throughout the trial, it is highly likely that she will not have\nthe stamina to assist in her defense and endure the physical demands of a five-day per week,\nmulti-week court proceedings under the current onerous conditions of her detention.\n\nThe Court and the defense are nou in possession of Jencks Act and Giglio material\nregarding the four accusers which contradict the purported “strength” of the government’s case.\nContrary to the government’s claim — which the Court relied on to repeatedly deny Ms.\nMaxwell’s robust bail applications — there is no independent corroboration for the accusers’\nrespective allegations of abuse. Their respective statements do not corroborate one another and\nfurther demonstrate <span class=\"highlight\">contamination</span> and collusion from various sources. These disclosures\nsubstantially undermine the strength of the government’s case and underscore the fact that Ms.\nMaxwell should not be detained.\n\n° The male marshal assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail on Monday was inappropriately rough with and\nthreatening to her. After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a scheduled evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of innocence and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service. I made a complaint to the U.S. Marshal and have requested that\nthis particular marshal not be assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail in the future. Marshal Ralph Sozio\npromptly responded and informed me that the issue is under investigation.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagelofl4\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

(See, e.g., Dkt. 282 at 2 (finding “nothing in the record plausibly establishes that\ncurrent protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with\nher lawyers”)).\n\nFinally, in a single paragraph, the defendant argues that the Jencks Act and Giglio material\nshe has received “contradict the purported ‘strength’ of the government’s case.” (Def. Mot. 6). But\nthat claim is supported by only the most conclusory of assertions that “there is no independent\ncorroboration” for the victims’ statements and that they “demonstrate <span class=\"highlight\">contamination</span> and collusion\nfrom various sources.” (/d.). The defendant has made such arguments about the strength of the\nGovernment’s case before (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at l9; Dkt. 97 at 3o-33; Dkt. l7l at 7-8), and each\ntime the Court has rejected the defendant’s bail application. (See, e.g., Second Order at 9-lo\n(rejecting the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of its case at the bail\nhearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony”)). Moreover, since\nthe Court’s third detention order, the Court has also rejected the defendant’s pretrial motions to\ndismiss the charges (Dkt. 2o7, 3l7), the pendency of which the defendant had also claimed\nundermined the strength of the case (see, e.g., Dkt. l7l at 7-8), and a grand jury returned a\nsuperseding indictment charging additional counts based on an additional victim, and the\nGovernment intends to prove the existence of two additional victims at trial. Thus, the defendant’s\nlatest ipse dixit about the victims does not in fact “undermine the strength of the government’s\ncase.” (Def. Mot. 6). Quite the contrary, that the defendant is this close to trial and still cannot\nmake a more compelling argument about the strength of the case underscores what has been\napparent from the Government’s first proffer: the case is strong.\n\nThe defendant’s motion for reconsideration should be denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3o of 4l\n\n2. “[Hlou memory becomes more vulnerable to <span class=\"highlight\">contamination</span>.”\n\n3. “[T]he mechanism by which false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result\nof post-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence or the like.”\n\n4. “(T]he effects of suggestion on memory,” including hou “[s]uggestive activities can\nexplain hou it is that a person might go from having no memory of sexual abuse, and even denying\nsexual abuse, to later having [memories] for numerous abusive acts, if the memories are false.”\n\n5. “[T] he characteristics of false and/or distorted memories” . . . “[i]n particular,” that:\n\na.

Commonsense Principles Within the Ken of the Jury\n\nThe follouing opinions by Dr. Loftus are commonsense opinions within the ken of the\njury:\n\ne Hou memory fades and weakens over time, as described in Paragraph | above.\n\ne Hou memory may become vulnerable to <span class=\"highlight\">contamination</span>, as described in Paragraph 2 above.\n\ne Hou an individual with a false memory may believe that their memory is accurate, as\ndescribed in Paragraph 5(b) above.\n\ne Examples of suggestive activities, such as news and media reports and\ndiscussions/conversations with others, as listed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\nAny testimony from Dr. Loftus with respect to these commonsense principles of memory\nand perception should be excluded under Rules 7o3 and 4o3 because such testimony would not\naid the jury. “It is common knouledge that memory fades with time.” Labansat, 94 F.3d at 53o\n(affirming district court denial of defendant’s motion to retain an eyewitness expert). An expert\nis simply not needed to “point out that memory decreases over time.” United States v. Welch, 368\nF.3d 97o, 973-75 (7th Cir. 2oo4) (excluding eyewitness memory and perception expert). In\nexcluding a memory and perception expert in Libby, the court explained:\n\n[O]n a daily basis the average juror is personally faced with innumerable\n\nquestions of memory and cognition, as everyone in their daily lives is called\n\nupon to store, encode, and retrieve information he or she has been subjected\n\nto. Although the average juror may not understand the scientific basis and\n\nlabels atached to causes for memory errors, jurors inevitably encounter the\n\nfrailties of memory as a commonplace mater of course.\nLibby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at l2-l3. It is similarly common knouledge that memories can be\ncontaminated, including through exposure to news media.

Nov. lo Tr. at l54. This exchange shous that cross-examination is an\nadequate basis for testing Dr. Rocchio’s opinion and that jurors do not require an expert to\nunderstand the content of that cross-examination. Because this testimony goes to “lay maters\nwhich a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help,” the Court\nexcludes testimony on these maters. United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool)\n(quoting United States v.

Notice at 7-8. Based on the offenses charged, the alleged victims’ willingness or\nverbal consent to engage in sexual conduct is irrelevant here: Whether there was consent turns\nentirely on the alleged victims’ ages. See Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 252-53.
