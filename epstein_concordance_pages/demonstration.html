Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual <span class=\"highlight\">demonstration</span> of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 4\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\nthat “[r]ecords, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand-jury proceedings must be kept under seal\nto the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a mater occurring\nbefore a grand jury.”\n\nRelatedly, the exhibits at issue—all of which pertain to several ex parte applications made\nby the Government—have previously been ordered to kept under seal by the relevant judicial\nofficers, who have made the requisite findings to warrant sealing. The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon <span class=\"highlight\">demonstration</span> that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001779.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 6o Filed lo/o6/2o Page l of 3\n.)

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual <span class=\"highlight\">demonstration</span> of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019555.jpg": "CGsedl ZD ae SBos Aden (hdc WHE 2o2 F iB 68h /Pag eatyei2i ab4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon <span class=\"highlight\">demonstration</span> that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022100.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page4of9\n\nIf the Government represents that it “it has fully complied with [its Rule l6] obligations\nand will continue to do so,” the defendant must put forward some “compelling <span class=\"highlight\">demonstration</span> to\nthe contrary” by pointing to a “specific failure by the Government to comply with its disclosure\nobligations” in order to justify a motion to compel. United States v. Minaya, 395 F. Supp. 2d 28,\n34 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5).\n\nB. Brady/Giglio\n\nUnder the Supreme Court’s decision in Brady v. Maryland, the Government “has a\nconstitutional duty to disclose evidence favorable to an accused when such evidence is material\nto guilt or punishment,” and as elaborated in Giglio v. United States, that obligation extends to\n“not only exculpatory material, but also information that could be used to impeach a key\n[GJovernment witness.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool). “Evidence is\nmaterial within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the\nevidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Turner v.\nUnited States, l37 S.

After\nMaxwell fell or was pushed off his yacht in l99l, it was revealed that he was working for “why four died i\nthe Israeli government and the Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence service. While Maxwell’s Governor Rhodes\nties to the Mossad are well-documented, Epstein’s connections are less well knoun. The relationship with\nLondon Sunday Times quoted a New York social observer describing Epstein as follous: April 2l, 2oo3\n“He’s Mr. Enigmatic.
