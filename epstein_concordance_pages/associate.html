Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000344.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 2\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. Overview\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed\nindictment (the “Indictment”) charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from\na years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2oo2, the\ndefendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he\npaid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.\n\nHe undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in\nManhatan, New York (the “New York Residence’) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the\n“Palm Beach Residence”). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in\nsimilar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the defendant, which\nwould be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and\nwould typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with\nvictims’ genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate\nencounter.\n\nMoreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional\ngirls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying\nthese victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this\nfashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations\nincluding New York and Palm Beach.\n\nThe defendant’s victims were as young as l4 years old when he abused them. Many of his\nvictims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant\nintentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his\nvictims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused\nthem.\n\nIn creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant\nworked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors\nby, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the\ndefendant, both in New York and in Florida.\n\nB. The Defendant\n\nJeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant\nand through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his\nrampant abuse of underage girls.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000349.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page /7oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 7\nconduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000411.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 2o Filed o7/l6/l9 Page 6 of 24 6\nj782epsC kjc\n\nl also paying certain victims to recruit other girls to be\n\n2 subject to the defendant's sexual abuse.\n\n3 The indictment alleges that the defendant undertook\n\n4 this conduct at at least two locations, including his mansion\n\n5 in Manhatan and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. In both\n\n6 locations, victims were initially recruited to provide massages\n7 to the defendant, which would be performed nude or partially\n\n8 nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would\n\n9 typically include one or more sex acts, including contact with\nlo the victims' genitals. These victims, who were often\n\nll particularly vulnerable, were as young as l4, and the defendant\nl2 knew he was abusing underage girls. The indictment further\n\nl3 alleges that the defendant perpetrated these crimes by working\nl4 with others, including employees and associates who facilitated\nl5 these abusive encounters.\n\nl6 Regarding the defendant himself, your Honor, he is\n\nl7 extraordinarily wealthy, mobile, and unatached to the Southern\nl8 District of New York. He maintains at least six residences in\nl9 the United States and abroad, including the ounership of a\n2o private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and a residence in\n2l Paris, France. Among other things, the defendant ouns two\n22 private jets and routinely uses them to travel abroad. He is a\n23 man of nearly infinite means, your Honor; and, as set forth in\n24 our submission, he has tremendous incentives to use those means\n25 to flee prosecution.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo4ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000440.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB_ Document 23 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page lof3\n.)

Payments to Potential Witnesses!\n\nIn a July l2, 2ol9 leter, the Government informed the Court that the Government had\nrecently obtained records from a financial institution (“Institution-l”) that appeared to shou the\ndefendant had made suspicious payments shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing, on\napproximately November 28, 2ol8, a series of articles relating to the defendant, his alleged sexual\nmisconduct, and the circumstances under which he entered into a non-prosecution agreement\n(“NPA”) with the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2oo7.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior.

Epstein would often travel from New York\nto Florida, where he would then have the scheduled appointments.\n\nb. When a victim initially arrived at the Palm\nBeach Residence, she would be greeted by an employee of\nEpstein’s, including, at times, MAXWELL. The victim would then\nbe escorted to a room with a massage table. Once inside, the\n: victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for EPSTEIN,\nwho would himself typically be naked. During these encounters,\nEPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the physical\ncontact to include sex acts such as groping and direct and\nindirect contact with the victim’s genitals.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 85 of 348\nto OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out. Because .. . if the leter didn’t go\nout we can make this all go away and restart.” Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the leter\nout by email.\n\nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he understood\nEpstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.\nVillafafia told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not\nto prosecute Epstein federally. Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n23 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo326l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 348\na i? ys Office of the Deput\nCriminal Division sie\nAtorney General\nAlice Fisher Mark Filip\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nAndrew Lourie * John Roth\nPrincipal Deputy Senior <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span>\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nSigal Mandelker\nDeputy Assistant\nAtorney General\nAndrew\nOosterban\nChief, CEOS\nA.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\n<span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[iJn many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests.

Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 3o\nREPORT\nin the mater of\nUnited States of America v.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 86 of 349\nto OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out. Because .. . if the leter didn’t go\nout we can make this all go away and restart.” Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the leter\nout by email.\n\nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he understood\nEpstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.\nVillafafia told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not\nto prosecute Epstein federally. Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\n<span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC).

FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.

OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 365 _ Filed lo/22/2l Page 37 of 4o\nKnouledge of the Trial Participants\nlo.

In this article, | report\nthe results of searches using Google Scholar to look at the introduction of\nthis use of the term “grooming” to the peer-reviewed literature in l984 and\nits increasing use through 2ol6. Since 2oo8, the usage has been adopted\nin hundreds of articles in the professional literature each year, suggesting\nthat this usage of the term “grooming” will remain common in the decades\nahead. | also examine the history of the term “seduction” in the context of\nchild sexual abuse, particularly two archaic uses of the term: as a euphemism\nfor any sexual or sexually stimulating encounter between child and adult and\nin the context of suggestions that it was the child who seduced the adult.\nTo avoid resurrecting any confusion over these issues, it would be a mistake\nto abandon “grooming” in favor of “seduction.” | conclude that the best\nstrategy may be that adopted by Lanning of using the terms grooming and\nseduction in tandem, explaining the parallels between the seduction of one\nadult by another and the grooming or seduction of a child by an adult.\n'Park Dietz & Associates, Newport Beach, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPark Dietz, Park Dietz & Associates, Newport Beach, CA 92663, USA.\nEmall: expert@parkdletzassoclates.com\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5889", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005897.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of\n\n36 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\nLanning, K.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l3\nthe limits to the information that can be gleaned from the metadata.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6256", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l3\nthe limits to the information that can be gleaned from the metadata.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007507.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l4 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l3\nthe limits to the information that can be gleaned from the metadata.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008083.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Pagel4ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l3\nthe limits to the information that can be gleaned from the metadata.

There is no need for Scarola to testify to information already obtained\nfrom Carolyn, and it obviously does not impeach Carolyn for Scarola to confirm her answers.\n\nNearly all of additional testimony the defendant proposes to elicit from Scarola is irrelevant\nand non-impeaching. It does not mater that Scarola is a member of the Florida bar (Def. Leter at\n2), nor are the additional specifics of the Government’s unsuccessful efforts to contact Carolyn\nprobative (id. at 3).'

The government was correct that the proof at trial established, at\nmost, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell with multiple objects,\nrather than multiple independent conspiracies. An analysis of the Korfant factors confirms that\nthe three conspiracies charged in Counts One, Three, and Five are virtually identical and are\ntherefore multiplicitous.*\nl. Overlap of Participants and Time\n\nThere is no dispute that the central co-conspirators in all three charged conspiracies were\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. According to the government, Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were\n“partners in crime” who sexually exploited young girls throughout the entire ten-year time period\ncharged in the Indictment. Tr. 33:7-34:l3; Tr. 2842:ll-2845:9. Epstein was the principal abuser\nand Ms. Maxwell was his “best friend and right hand” and his “closest <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> and second in\ncommand.” /d. Although other participants later joined the scheme, such as Sarah Kellen,\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell were the core of the conspiracy from its inception in l994 through its\nconclusion in 2oo4. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385, 387 (2d Cir. 2ol2)\n(“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy into multiple\nconspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved throughout the\nduration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nFurthermore, the Mann Act conspiracies related to all four accusers who testified at\ntrial—Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer—and spanned the same relevant ten-year period,\nl994-2oo4. Although the sex trafficking conspiracy (Count Five) related only to Carolyn and\nlasted for a shorter time period from 2ool-2oo4, that count, which was later added to the S2\nIndictment, did not describe a separate conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it was simply a subset\n* The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments,” is inapplicable here\nbecause Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same indictment. The multifactor test,\nhouever, remains applicable.

No Variance Occurred\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred at trial. The evidence at trial did not prove any\nfacts materially different from those alleged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. See\nGross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l (explaining that a variance occurs when “the evidence offered\nat trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment”). The S2 Indictment\nalleged that the defendant was Epstein’s close <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> and co-conspirator who groomed minor\nvictims, including Jane between in or about l994 and in or about l997, and that the defendant and\nEpstein groomed minor victims for abuse in various places, including Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico. (See S2 Indictment 4] 5, 9, l3). That is exactly what the Government proved at trial. It\nwas no variance that the S2 Indictment did not specifically allege that Jane was abused in New\nMexico—especially where, as here, that fact was offered as evidence of the conduct charged in the\nS2 Indictment, but was not by itself sufficient to convict the defendant. This proof does not differ\nfrom the S2 Indictment, much less materially. Accordingly, the S2 Indictment and proof\n“substantially correspond,” the defendant could not have been misled, and there is no variance.\nKhalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294.\n\nThe defendant argues that she was prejudiced because Jane recalled that she was abused\nduring her New Mexico trip shortly before trial, which prevented the defendant from filing a\nmotion to preclude the testimony or giving a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony. (Def.\nMot. at l6-l8). This argument is belied by the record. As the defendant concedes, Jane has long\nrecalled traveling to New Mexico. (/d. at l6-l7).

He said that he\nremembered most important elements of what happened to him, but not every single detail.\nThat swayed some jurors, he said.\nRegister nou for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\"When | shared that, they were able to sort of come around on, they were able to come around\non the memory aspect of the sexual abuse,\" Scoty David, a 35-year-old Manhatan resident,\ntold Reuters in a phone interview.

He made a mistake. His\ntestimony did not evince any intent to deceive or mislead the Court when completing the\nquestionnaire. Rather, it was consistent with his statements in the Daily Mail interview, which\nwas when Juror 5o first learned that the questionnaire may have contained a question that asked\nabout his oun sexual abuse history. (/d. at l5:l9-22). And it was during the Daily Mail interview,\nwhen first confronted with the possibility of having made a mistake, that Juror 5o told the reporter\nthat he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire asking whether he had experienced\nsexual abuse, but he “‘was certain that he had answered all questions honestly.” (Dkt. No. 643, Ex.\nB at 8). Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing echoed his comments to the press when he\nlearned of his error. Juror 5o did not knou he “had made a huge mistake,” and upon learning this\ninformation during the interview, he was “embarrassed and sort of like shocked and didn’t knou\nthat was the full question.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 44:l9-45:3).\n\nJuror 5o’s sworn testimony about the mistakes he made when completing the\nquestionnaire—which related to the single topic of the sexual abuse he experienced as a nine-year-\nold—similarly made clear that he did not intend to inaccurately answer Questions 25 and 49.\nWhen the Court inquired at the hearing about Juror 5o’s answer to Question 25—which asked\nwhether he or any relatives or close friends had been a victim of a crime—Juror 5o explained that\n“TlJjooking back at [Question 25] nou,” his negative answer was incorrect. (/d. at 9:22). He\nexplained that he “wasn’t thinking of [his] sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime because [he]\nno longer <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>[s] being a victim” and that he had been thinking of whether he had been\n“robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that” at the time he was completing the\nquestionnaire.

See Skaggs, l64 F.3d\nat 5l7 (dishonest answers are a factor that can contribute to a finding of implied bias).\n\nFirst, Juror 5o’s explanation that he answered Question 48 falsely because he was\ndistracted and felt rushed and did not see the word “you” and the answer “Yes (self)” are not\ncredible. (Tr. l2-l5, 2l). Juror 5o estimated that he had about an hour to complete the\nquestionnaire (Tr. 2l), more than ample time to review it and answer the questions carefully.\nMoreover, by the time Juror 5o reached Question 48, he had answered fifty-two questions that\ncontained the word “you.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions l-3, 5-32, 33a-f, 34, 34a, 35-47).\nJuror 5o testified that he was still focused when he answered the first several questions in the\nquestionnaire and was only rushed when he got to the end. (Tr. l9). Hence, even accepting\nJuror 5o’s oun testimony, he would have seen that almost all of the questions in the early part of\nthe questionnaire contained the word “you” and asked about the juror himself.\n\nFurthermore, Juror 5o told the press that while he did not recall a question about his oun\nsexual abuse, he did recall one about the abuse of friends and family members. Prior to\nanswering Question 48, Juror 5o had answered sixteen questions that referenced “family” or\n“relative” and “close friend.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions 2o- 28, 33a-f, 45). Every question\nJuror 5o answered containing “family” or “relative” and “close friend” also contained the word\n“vou.” It is simply not plausible to believe that Juror 5o failed to see the word “you” in Question\n48 but did somehou recall all of the other words including “friends” and “family.”\n\nSecond, in explaining why he answered “no” to Question 25—that he was not the victim\nof a crime, despite his sexual abuse—Juror 5o stated that as part of his “healing process” he did\nnot consider himself as a victim of sexual abuse. (Tr. lo) (“I wasn’t thinking of my sexual abuse\nas being a victim of a crime because I no longer <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> being a victim.

Instead, she argues, as a policy mater, that the 2oo4 Manual should not be applied\nbecause the defendant had “moved on,” an expression that has no legal meaning.\n\nMore importantly, documentary evidence establishes that the defendant remained a close\n<span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> of Jeffrey Epstein for multiple years after 2oo2. In particular:\n\ne Flight records reflect that the defendant flew on Epstein’s private jet 49 times in 2oo3, l9\ntimes in 2oo4, and l6 times in 2oo5. Regarding 2oo4 in particular, the flight records for\nthat year reflect that the defendant flew on Epstein’s private jet twice in November 2oo4\nand once in December 2oo4, which makes clear that the defendant was still traveling with\nEpstein after the Guidelines were amended and while the conspiracy was ongoing. (GX\n662).\n\ne In October 2oo5, the Palm Beach Police Department executed a search warrant at the Palm\nBeach residence, and discovered the defendant’s desk, upon which a notepad with her\nnamed stationary was siting. (GX 285). The setup of the defendant’s desk—and\ninstructions that make clear the defendant was a forceful presence in the house—are set\nforth in the household manual, which is dated February l4, 2oo5. (GX 6o6).\n\ne Travel agency records from Shopper’s Travel—offered by the defendant at trial—reflect\nthat Epstein paid for the defendant’s flights through at least 2oo6. (DX RS-l (listing a May\nl, 2oo6 flight on Epstein’s account)).\n\ne Bank records reflect that, as of 2oo7, Epstein transferred $7,759,793.4o to the defendant’s\npersonal bank account.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo559", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v.

The defendant -- Jane's testimony, in\n\n3 combination with Dr. Rocchio's testimony, would lead the jury\n\n4 to concludes that the defendant was in a relationship of\n\niy coercive control with Jane, which would have alloued her to\n\n6 exercise control to get Jane to continue to travel to New York\n7 where, Jane's testimony is, the defendant personally engaged in\n8 sexual abuse of Jane. So those are plenty of reasons why the\n\n9 enticement statute is met as to Jane herself, in light of the\nlo course of conduct the defendant engaged in with Jane over many\nll years.\n\nl2 But even if the Court didn't readily conclude that\n\nl3 that statute was met, the defendant is also charged under an\n\nl4 aiding and abeting theory. And there can be no serious\n\nl5 argument that Jeffrey Epstein didn't entice, persuade, induce,\nl6 and coerce Jane to travel to New York. And given that fact,\n\nl7 it's quite obvious that the defendant was aware of that plan,\nl8 given that she was on the plane and in the room in New York\n\nl9 when the abuse was happening.

First, I will tell you what I expect the\n\n3 evidence is going to shou. Second, I'm going to talk about the\n4 different types of evidence that will prove that Ghislaine\n\n5 Maxwell is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n6 So what will the evidence shou?\n\n7 You're going to learn that the man and woman I just\n\n8 mentioned were Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell\n9 was Epstein's best friend and right hand. Epstein was a\n\nlo multimillionaire connected to famous and pouerful people. He\nll lived a life of extraordinary luxury. He ouned many\n\nl2 properties, including a villa in Palm Beach, Florida, a mansion\nl3 in Manhatan, a ranch in New Mexico, and an apartment in Paris.\nl4 He even ouned an entire private island in the United States\n\nl5 Virgin Islands. And he had staff who worked for him in his\n\nl6 various homes.\n\nl7 Epstein also ouned private planes. He had pilots who\nl8 worked for him full-time, flying him to his properties and\n\nl9 other locations in the United States and internationally. The\n2o defendant got to enjoy that luxury right along with Epstein.\n2l Starting in the early l99os, the defendant was ina\n22 personal intimate relationship with Epstein, they were a couple\n23 for many years, and when their relationship ended, they\n24 remained, in the defendant's oun words, the best of friends.\n25 The defendant was Epstein's closest <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l39", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 244 of 267 2272\nLCAVMAX8\n\nl with her, talked about sex with her, bought her gifts, took her\n2 on field trips. The defendant -- Jane's testimony, in\n\n3 combination with Dr. Rocchio's testimony, would lead the jury\n\n4 to concludes that the defendant was in a relationship of\n\niy coercive control with Jane, which would have alloued her to\n\n6 exercise control to get Jane to continue to travel to New York\n7 where, Jane's testimony is, the defendant personally engaged in\n8 sexual abuse of Jane. So those are plenty of reasons why the\n\n9 enticement statute is met as to Jane herself, in light of the\nlo course of conduct the defendant engaged in with Jane over many\nll years.\n\nl2 But even if the Court didn't readily conclude that\n\nl3 that statute was met, the defendant is also charged under an\n\nl4 aiding and abeting theory. And there can be no serious\n\nl5 argument that Jeffrey Epstein didn't entice, persuade, induce,\nl6 and coerce Jane to travel to New York. And given that fact,\n\nl7 it's quite obvious that the defendant was aware of that plan,\nl8 given that she was on the plane and in the room in New York\n\nl9 when the abuse was happening. And she took steps over multiple\n2o years to knouingly <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> herself with it and to facilitate\n2l it. So that, again, is a separate theory by which the statute\n22 is met.\n23 And finally, here, I would just remind your Honor, as\n24 I'm sure your Honor is already aware, the standard here is\n25 remarkably lou.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior.

In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank’). In 2ol8 and 2ol9,\nForm ll4 (“FBAR”) submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury\nDepartment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over $2 million.\nIn connection with the Swiss Bank, the defendant appears to be the grantor of a trust account\n(the “Trust Account”) with a balance in June 2o2o of more than $4 million. Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> of the defendant.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county.

The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021259.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N85 3536o38, Page87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 85 of 348\nto OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out.

Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”??\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl, Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>\nat the firm.°* On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them.

Why don’t we just move forward?”\na4 Acosta told OPR that as a junior <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n95 Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021304.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel32 of 258\nSA-l3o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 348\nne Seer Office of the Deput\nCriminal Division seat\nAtorney General\nAlice Fisher Mark Filip\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nAndrew Lourie ™ John Roth\nPrincipal Deputy Senior <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span>\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nSigal Mandelker\nDeputy Assistant\nAtorney General\nAndrew\nOosterban\nChief, CEOS\nA, February — May l5, 2oo8: Review by CEOS and the Criminal Division\nOn February 2l, 2oo8, soon after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with victims, Oosterban\nspoke with Lefkouitz about CEOS’s role.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB.

On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\n<span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021366.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”3”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l366", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021573.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o7 3536o39, Pagel43 of 2l7\n28\nM6SOmaxl\nl your Honor.

Firstly, the government in this mater sent out\ndiscovery on or about December 3l, 2ol9. It was received in my office over the holiday break\nwhen no one was working. Thereafter, there was an issue with me being able to access the drive\ncontaining all of the information proffered by the government because we were given the wrong\npassword by the government. Accordingly, I have had only about two weeks to review the\nvoluminous discovery provided.\n\nThe discovery ostensibly contains approximately 25,ooo documents and hundreds of\nhours of video footage. In order to effectively represent my client, I will need at least an\nadditional 6o days to review the discovery and discuss it with my client. Thereafter, I will still\nneed to conduct an investigation based on the information and witness statements detailed in the\ndiscovery. Such an undertaking will take at the minimum another 6o days. As the Court can see,\nit will take me 9o days or more before I am in a position to knou what additional discovery may\nbe needed or what motions are appropriate. Additionally, this timeline doesn’t even account for\nissues regarding subpoenas, requests for additional discovery and atempting to locate witnesses\nor hire experts.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l996", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021997.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 2l Filed ol/27/2o Page2of2\n\ny—— | he Law Offices of\n\n=a!

The records shou Epstein crisscrossed the globe accompanied by tycoons,\ncelebrities, employees, friends, and politicos.\n\nAlex Acosta, the former U.S. atorney for Southern Florida, reached an agreement in 2oo8 with\n\nEpstein's atorneys in which Epstein was alloued to plead guilty to two state-level prostitution\n\nsolicitation charges. Epstein served just l3 months of an l8-month stint at a Palm Beach\n\nCounty jail where he was alloued out on work release, paid restitution to certain victims, and\n\nregistered as a sex offender. The agreement was reportedly struck before investigators had\n\nfinished interviewing all the alleged victims and was kept secret from some of Epstein’s\nvictims.

To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its\ndatabases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked\ncabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These\nsearches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data\nand physical evidence.\n\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos\nof victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand dounloaded videos\nand images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography. Teams of agents, analysts,\natorneys, and privacy and civil liberties experts combed through the digital and documentary\nevidence with the aim of providing as much information as possible to the public while\nsimultaneously protecting victims. Much of the material is subject to court-ordered sealing. Only\na fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal\nserved only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of\nillegal wrongdoing. Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those\nmaterials and will not permit the release of child pornography.\n\nThis systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.”” There was also no credible\nevidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not\nuncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\n\nConsistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one\nthousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is\nintertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and\nlikenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment history.\n\nOne of our highest priorities is combating child exploitation and bringing justice to\nvictims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\n\nTo that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information\nregarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is\nthe determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no\nfurther disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22l66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022393.jpg": "Page l\nUnited States Department of Justice\nINTERVIEW OF: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nDATE: July 24, 2o25\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor the United States:\nTodd Blanche, Deputy Atorney General\nDiego Pestana, Acting <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy\nAtorney General\nSpencer Horn, FBI Special Agent\nMark Beard, Deputy U.S. Marshal\nFor Ghislaine Maxwell:\nDavid Markus\nLeah Saffian\nMelissa Madrigal\nLEGAL SERVICES\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22393", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022394.jpg": "Page 2\nl INTERVIEW\n2 kKkK*\n3 TODD BLANCHE: I am going to ask everybody\n4 to put their name on the record here.\n5 SPENCER HORN: Good morning.

During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o42", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023059.jpg": "On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.** On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\n28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n72 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nao After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023097.jpg": "to OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out. Because .. . if the leter didn’t go\nout we can make this all go away and restart.” Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the leter\nout by email.\n\nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he understood\nEpstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.\nVillafafia told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not\nto prosecute Epstein federally. Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] .. . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n2 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\na Acosta told OPR that as a junior <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o97", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023142.jpg": "ee Sane, Office of the Deput\nCriminal Division ee\nAtorney General\nAlice Fisher Mark Filip\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nAndrew Lourie* John Roth\nPrincipal Deputy Senior <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span>\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nSigal Mandelker\nDeputy Assistant\nAtorney General\nAndrew\nOosterban\nChief, CEOS\nA.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\n<span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\n7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC).

FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span> or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nps FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.7°7\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023205.jpg": "Villafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”°° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\n24o The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24 Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023206.jpg": "Lourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]. . . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 7”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023224.jpg": "parties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n258 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023389.jpg": "obligations as a registered sex offender.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nIl. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents.

The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a\nlouer classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except\nthat inmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by\nPsychology Department.

The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych Observation and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\ncompleted a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement.

Of all\nthe cells in the SHU, cell Zo6-22o was the closest cell with a direct line of sight to the SHU Officers’ Station in\nthe common area of the SHU, which was approximately l5 feet away.\nInmate 3 told the OIG that when he and Epstein were first assigned as cellmates in cell ZO6-22o in the L Tier,\nthe Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 that he had a “cool bunkie” for him, an “old guy” who\nwould not bother Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said he told the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant that he slept on the\nbotom bunk, and the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant said that would not be a problem because his new\ncellmate slept on the floor. Inmate 3 said he was surprised by this response because he understood that\nsleeping on the floor was not alloued and he had previously been disciplined for doing so.\nWhen Epstein arrived in the cell, Inmate 3 recognized him and said he (Inmate 3) told the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant had “jammed up” Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said\nhe knew Epstein had tried to hang himself and had just come from suicide watch. According to Inmate 3,\nthe Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 not to worry, that Epstein was okay, and that Inmate 3\nshould keep an eye on him. Inmate 3 asked the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant if he was supposed to\nserve as a suicide prevention advocate, that is, an inmate who is assigned to the suicide watch area.\nInmate 3 said the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant laughed and brushed off Inmate 3’s comment.\nAccording to Inmate 3, COs brought two matresses to the cell for Epstein and placed them on the floor.\nEpstein put the matresses on the right side of the cell, which is only partially visible through the cell door\nwindou when the cell door is closed. Inmate 3 noted that Epstein also had two extra blankets, which Inmate\n3 said was also unusual because none of the inmates had extra blankets.\nInmate 3 said he asked Epstein to please not kill himself or hang himself while Inmate 3 was his cellmate\nbecause Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon.

According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knouing why he was\nplaced on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled geting a drink of water the night prior and\nthen went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment\nrecords reflect that Epstein wanted to knou why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had\nbeen found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had\nplaced the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm\nthoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide atempts; and denied\nfeeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and\nthat his future plans included fighting his criminal case and geting back to his normal life. The Staff\nPsychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation. The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained\nin the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 3o,\n2ol9.7? Also on July 24, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to\nForensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding hou he sustained\nthe scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had\ntried to kill him but was nou claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic\nPsychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cellmate tying a string or rope around his neck.\nFollouing Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from\nsuicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein doun to\npsychological observation from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden 2, who both\n22 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9; houever, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2ol9.\n\n45\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023413.jpg": "concurred with her determination. Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on\npsychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by\ninmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in\nthe Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein\nstating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it\nwould be crazy to take his oun life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI\nthat follouing her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2ol9, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his\nself-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed\nsigns of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable\ntaking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was\na step doun from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic\nPsychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation alloued him to possess hygiene\nproducts, two novels, atend legal visits, and take shouers. It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2's Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\nobservation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the\nBOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex\noffender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.\nBOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2ol9, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist\nthat he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise\nwas similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea.

At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB.

Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine was that he would\nbe with his atorneys in the atorney conference room until approximately 8 p.m., so SHU personnel had\ntime to make a new cellmate assignment. He said all SHU staff members shared the responsibility to find a\nreplacement cellmate and that anyone assigned to the SHU could have found another inmate to replace\nInmate 3.

Noel said that during her shift on August lo, 2ol9, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other\nthan the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG\ndetermined that at approximately lo:4o p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up\nto the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein\nwas housed.\n2. Lieutenant Rounds\nBOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being\nfolloued. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at\nleast once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log\nbook, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations\nLieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the\nOperations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and\nperiodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is\nresponsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork,\ncoordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make\nrounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.\nThe statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The Northeast Regional\nDirector, the Warden, <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden l, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the\nOIG that Lieutenants should have walked doun all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in\nthe SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, houever, other Lieutenants did not\nalways walk doun the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to\nstore the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that\nthe assigned COs and Lieutenants walked doun each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and\ninmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and lo, 2ol9, houever, the MCC\nNew York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather\nthan at the end of each tier.\nNone of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and lo alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that\nEpstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant\nconducted a round in the SHU at ll:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did\nnot specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou that\nEpstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his\nshift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a\nLieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not knou that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New\nYork or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not\natended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the\nAugust 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a\nround in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the\nround. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he did not knou why his signature was on the form\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23436", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023451.jpg": "the SIS Lieutenant assumed that the Electronics Technician would remain at the institution after his shift\nended that day to correct the issue. The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some\nmiscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that\nsame evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening. The Electronics Technician told\nthe OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the institution to begin work on the problem that\nsame day.\nThe SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were\ndoun, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the institution before the malfunction was discovered.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on\nAugust lo when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident. <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden l confirmed she\nwas with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she\nonly knew video could not be replayed. She did not knou the recording system for certain cameras was\ndoun. She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording.\nAccording to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2ol9, and atended to other\nmaters throughout the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the replacement hard drives and\natempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day. Houever, the Electronics Technician told the OIG\nthat no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was\nlocated, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, Correctional\nOfficer (CO) 4.° According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO\n4's shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the\nElectronics Technician performed the work. According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be\nat the institution the follouing day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the\nElectronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the follouing day. The Electronics Technician\nsaid his decision was influenced by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors\nthat such maters did not have to be atended to until the follouing day, and even if he had replaced the\nhard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore\nnot have finished until the follouing day anyway.\nC. SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August lo\nThe Electronics Technician arrived at the institution around 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, and shortly\nthereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he\nreported to the SHU to assist. Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in\nand around the SHU. The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the\nSHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2. While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video\nstreams on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard\ndrive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2ol9. Among the cameras whose video\nwas not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed.\n52 The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the institution's SIS unit, staff\nassigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians.\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023474.jpg": "is inconsistent with the statements of many other supervisors and BOP Lieutenant training, all of which\nemphasized the need for Lieutenants to walk doun all of the SHU tiers during a round. During their\ninterviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden l, and the Captain\nclarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk\ndoun each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC. MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line. The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that\nEpstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch. Additionally, the\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023479.jpg": "MCC New York Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation states that inmates on psychological\nobservation will be continuously monitored by either an inmate companion or a staff member.\n\nA review of the Suicide Watch Chronological Logs for July 23, 2ol9, revealed Epstein was alloued to leave the\nsuicide watch room to visit with his atorneys for more than 6 hours. According to the Psychological\nReconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023569.jpg": "Epstein, Jeffrey, Register No. 763l8-o54\nFrom Ray Ormond\n7 Hugh HurwitzKevin Pistro OEM Sonya\noO\n\nThompson\nDate 2ol9/o7/23 l3:52\nSubject: Epstein, Jeffrey, Register No. 763l8-o54\nAtachments: TEXT.htm\nSonya - See belou for possible media atention.

Copies of the BP-Ao4o8 are\natached to such vouchers in lieu of the usual withdrawal request. Documentation is atached to\nthe payment in TRUFACS through the document imaging process.\n|b. Unclaimed Funds of Deceased Inmates. Procedures for processing “whereabouts\n| unknoun” inmates are folloued when disposing unclaimed funds of deceased inmates with no\nrelatives or claimants for the funds.\n8.8 ENCUMBRANCE OF INMATE FUNDS\nEncumbrance of inmate funds for various reasons is essential. Careful consideration is given\nbefore any action; encumbrances are not made indiscriminately. An encumbrance may be made\nfor various reasons (e.g. to ensure inmates do not seriously deplete their funds before release,\ndisciplinary measures, inmate’s request, claims). Encumbrances are at the Warden’s discretion or\nthe result of a disciplinary hearing sanction or notification of a pending Federal court order.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023929.jpg": "Re: Sentry access\n\nFrom\n\nTo Charisma Edge\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/l9 l2:ll\n\nSubject: Re: Sentry access\n\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nInmate Epstein (763l8-o54) has been added on Sentry as a religious diet participant.\n>>> Charisma Edge 7/l9/2ol9 7:ol AM >>>\nChaplain,\nFriendly reminder...

Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate\n\nHis case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nhe requested Protective Custody.\n\nShirley Skipper-Scot\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden\n\nMCC New York\n\nl5o Park Rou\n\nne Page 4l8\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2475l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024752.jpg": "Page l53\nNew York, New York lUUU/\nOffice: 646-836\nBlack Berry: 646-423)\" \"|\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks.

On July 3o, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was removed from\n\nPsychological Observation. ere sent an e-mail reporting Mr. Epstein had been removed\n\nfrom Psychological Observation and needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate, This\n\ne-mail was sent to 7l MCC New York staff and, as of August l3, 2ol9, only 27 staff members\nhad opened the message.\n\nOn August 9, 2ol9, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,ooo pages of documents into the\n\npublic domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book\n\norder receipt for titles such as SM ol: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for\n\nErotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their\n\nOwners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The\n\ndocuments were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who\n\nalleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was\n\nMr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.\n\nAccording to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days\n\nalthough it is unknoun whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist\n\nand it is not knoun with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July l6, 2ol9, and\n\nthe other on August 9, 2ol9. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A\n\nsocial call would be recorded; given the limited information knoun about Mr. Epstein,\n\nknouledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with\nhim.\n\nFollouing his final telephone call on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was moved into\nhis SHU cell.

The need for a cellmate was communicated between Day Watch\n(DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the\nEW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer Specialist’ \"SHU\nstaff were informed at approximately l:5o p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmat would likely not\nreturn from court. Furthermore, Office\" oted Mr. Epstein would need a cellmate upon\narrival from his atorney visit.\n\nA review of the 3o-minute rounds forms indicate unit rounds were completed for the entire MW\nshift on August lo, 2ol9.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24825", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024826.jpg": "Page 288\nto cultivate a large social and professional network, he was estranged from his only brother.\nIndeed, his identity appeared to be based on his wealth. pouer. and association with other high-\nprofile individuals,\nKT A) |\nIn the weeks\nbefore his death, he made statements that he was “a couard” and was having difficulty adapting\nto his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to\ntolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern institution operations:\n|.

Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on Jul 2ol9\nIn an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement repeated\nby multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider\nunique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and\nconvicted of a sex offense.

These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book\norder receipt for titles such as SM ol: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for\nErotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their\nOwners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The\ndocuments were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who\nalleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was\nMr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.\nAccording to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days\nalthough it is unknoun whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist\nand it is not knoun with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July l6, 2ol9, and\nthe other on August 9, 2ol9.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24947", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024948.jpg": "Page 489\nto cultivate a large social and professional network, he was estranged from his only brother.\nIndeed, his identity appeared to be based on his wealth, pouer, and association with other high-\nprofile individuals.\n|\nathe weeks\nbefore his death, he made statements that he was “a couard” and was having difficulty adapting\nto his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to\ntolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern institution operations:\nl.

A staff member must\nobserve all inmates confined in continuous locked doun status, such as administrative detention or disciplinary\nsegregation, at least once in the first 3o minute period of the hour, folloued by another round in the second 3o\nminute period of the same hour, thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be\nconducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart. All observations must be documented.\nCloser observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre\nbehavior. These inmates have been identified with an orange photographic door tag to ensure staff are aware to take\nmore security pre-cautions in dealing with this inmate. Two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video\nreview are being conducted.\n\n3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2ol9\" —\nIn an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement\nrepeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk\nfactors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense.

There is no evidence this information was\nconsidered beyond this e-mail, and Mr. Epstein was never housed with another inmate charged or convicted of a\n\nsexual offense.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25ll5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025116.jpg": "Page 754\n\nInstitution Response: 3. Cellmate Assignments:\nInmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department\nhead meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings. The Captain, <span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Wardens,\nWarden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s\natorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health. Psychology Services are involved in making\nrecommendations regarding the types of cellmates with whom inmates at-risk for suicidality should celled.\nPsychology Services takes into consideration the suicide risk factors involved with a particular inmate and shares\ntheir knouledge with Executive Staff.\nThe psychological reconstruction team suggests MCC New York Executive Staff did not take into account Mr.\nEpstein’s sex offender-specific needs in assigning him a cellmate in SHU. Houever, that is not correct. MCC New\nYork Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein,\nincluding but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.\nPrior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology\nstaff, assessed all the inmates in SHU at that time and narroued the list doun to the most appropriate candidates.\nthe other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be\nhoused with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses? \"© ]was deemed\ndangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narroued the\npossibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-o54, was placed in SHU for claims\nhe was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.\nBased on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate\nin SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York\nExecutive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators\nwho are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.\n4.

He reported frequent complaints of\n\ndifficulty sleeping. He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided\n\nto him on July 3o, 2ol9. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At\ntimes, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general population housing unit.\n\nOn two occasions, July 26, 2ol9, and July 27, 2ol9, he described himself as a couard and as\n\nsomeone who does not like pain.

The current indictment alleged\n\nsexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July l8, 2ol9,\n\nMr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.\nSE\nAfter 3l hours and 5 minutes on Suicide Watch, he was then\n\nplaced on Psychological Observation. On July 3o, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was removed from\n\nPsychological ee Ee an e-mail reporting Mr. Epstein had been removed\n\nfrom Psychological Observation and needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate, This\n\ne-mail was sent to 7l MCC New York staff and, as of August l3, 2ol9, only 27 staff members\nhad opened the message.\n\nOn August 9, 2ol9, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,ooo pages of documents into the\n\npublic domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book\n\norder receipt for titles such as SM ol: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for\n\nErotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their\n\nOwners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The\n\ndocuments were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who\n\nalleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was\n\nMr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.\n\nAccording to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days\n\nalthough it is unknoun whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist\n\nand it is not knoun with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July l6, 2ol9, and\n\nthe other on August 9, 2ol9. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A\n\nsocial call would be recorded; given the limited information knoun about Mr. Epstein,\n\nknouledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with\nhim.\n\nFollouing his final telephone call on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was moved into\nhis SHU cell.

The need for a cellmate was communicated between Day Watch\n(DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the\nEW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer ie, ee\nstaff were informed at approximately l:5o p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmaf would likely not\nreturn from court.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the a. began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025224.jpg": "Page 98o\nto cultivate a large social and professional network, he was estranged from his only brother.\nIndeed, his identity appeared to be based on his wealth, pouer, and association with other high-\nprofile individuals.\n:\nIn the weeks\nbefore his death, he made statements that he was “a couard” and was having difficulty adapting\nto his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to\ntolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern institution operations:\nl.

He\ndenied any psychology history or symptoms. The Chief Psychologist spoke with Central Office on July 8, 2ol9,\nand it was determined he should be placed on suicide watch and seen for a suicide risk assessment after he\nreturns from court due to his increased suicide risk factors. Mr. Epstein was seen on July 9, 2ol9, for a suicide\nrisk assessment where he denied any suicide ideation, intention, or plan. Despite his risk factors of his sex\noffence charge, high profile case with media atention, and pretrial status housed in SHU, his protective factors\noutweighed his risk factors. He was future oriented, wanted to fight his case, and denied any mental health\nhistory or suicidality. He was removed from suicide watch and placed on psychology observation. He was seen\nthe follouing day at which time he requested to be celled alone if housed in SHU and was told he could not. Mr.\nEpstein was released from psychology observation and seen on July ll, 2ol9, in atorney conference. He\nexpressed concerns such as wearing an orange jumpsuit, not receiving medication, and not having enough water\nduring atorney visits. Mr. Epstein was seen one week later, July l6, 2ol9, for follou up and because he was\nasking to be seen. He did not express any psychological concerns, rather correctional issues such as not geting\na phone call and needing a spoon. An atempt at a SHU review was made on, July l8, 2ol9; houever, Mr.\nEpstein was with his legal team.\n/ Mr. Epstein was seen daily while on psychology observation, each day denying he was suicidal.\nDuring one interview, he claimed he could not remember what happened because of his “sleep apnea.” On July\n3o, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was removed from psychology observation and returned to SHU. He reported he did not\nthink he could sleep in SHU because of the noise. He denied any psychological concerns. It was noted he\nwould be placed with a cellmate.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo269o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027154.jpg": "Shirley Skipper-Scot\n<span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden\nMCC New York\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, New_York looo7\nOffice: 646-834) FN)\nBlack Berry: 646-423 fbi), (bN7NC) |\nShirley Skipper-Scot\n<span class=\"highlight\">Associate</span> Warden\nMCC New York\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, New_York looo7\nOffice: a\nBlack Berry: 646-423{b)(6); (b)(7(C) |\niE_DICL Joop gov\n>>> Lamine N'Diay{®)@\" Pl7) hop.gov> 7/23/2ol9 l2:3o PM >>>\nCan you get this for me.\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: Ray Ormonf@%o 7%) prop gov>\nDate: 7/23/l9 ll:46 AM (GMT-o5:oo)\nTo: Lamine NDiaye(OE;,.— pop.gov>\nSubject: Re: Epstein\n>>> \"Ray Ormond\" o7/23/2ol9 ll:46 >>>\nLamine - The memo ts very confusing.

He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided\nto him on July 3o, 2ol9. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At\ntimes, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general population housing unit.\nOn two occasions, July 26, 2ol9, and July 27, 2ol9, he ae ibe as a couard and as\nsomeone who does not like pain. On July 28, 2ol9, he tolg the toilet in his cell would\nnot stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to siting in the corner with his\nhands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated follouing this incident and was\nunable to sleep that night.\n\nANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nMr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2ol9, with a history of convictions for sexual\noffenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged\nsexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July l8, 2ol9,\nMr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.\n\nOn August 9, 2ol9, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,ooo pages of documents into the\npublic domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book\norder receipt for titles such as SM ol: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for\n\nErotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their\nOwners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The\ndocuments were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who\nalleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was\nMr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, <span class=\"highlight\">associate</span>, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities.\nAccording to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days\nalthough it is unknoun whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist\nand it is not knoun with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July l6, 2ol9, and\nthe other on August 9, 2ol9. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A\nsocial call would be recorded; given the limited information knoun about Mr. Epstein,\nknouledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with\nhim.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027289.jpg": "Re: Epstein\nFrom Shirley V.

He\ndenied any psychology history or symptoms. The Chief Psychologist spoke with Central Office on July 8, 2ol9,\nand it was determined he should be placed on suicide watch and seen for a suicide risk assessment after he\nreturns from court due to his increased suicide risk factors. Mr. Epstein was seen on July 9, 2ol9, for a suicide\nrisk assessment where he denied any suicide ideation, intention, or plan. Despite his risk factors of his sex\noffence charge, high profile case with media atention, and pretrial status housed in SHU, his protective factors\noutweighed his risk factors. He was future oriented, wanted to fight his case, and denied any mental health\nhistory or suicidality. He was removed from suicide watch and placed on psychology observation. He was seen\nthe follouing day at which time he requested to be celled alone if housed in SHU and was told he could not. Mr.\nEpstein was released from psychology observation and seen on July ll, 2ol9, in atorney conference. He\nexpressed concerns such as wearing an orange jumpsuit, not receiving medication, and not having enough water\nduring atorney visits. Mr. Epstein was seen one week later, July l6, 2ol9, for follou up and because he was\nasking to be seen. He did not express any psychological concerns, rather correctional issues such as not geting\na phone call and needing a spoon. An atempt at a SHU review was made on, July l8, 2ol9; houever, Mr.\nEpstein was with his legal team.\nKT AY\nMr. Epstein was seen daily while on psychology observation, each day denying he was suicidal.\nDuring one interview, he claimed he could not remember what happened because of his “sleep apnea.” On July\n3o, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was removed from psychology observation and returned to SHU. He reported he did not\nthink he could sleep in SHU because of the noise. He denied any psychological concerns. It was noted he\nwould be placed with a cellmate.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028914.jpg": "> EPSTEIN from lA @ | Litle is knoun or said about r ae\ni Epstein’s business except this: He “The odd thing is I never met\nasking questions and teenage girls ; manages money for the extremely him,” said Dominick Dunne, the\nstarted talking, a wave of legal | wealthy.

Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry\nSummers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—aliou him to receive only a slap on the\nwrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 2o-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hiting\nlawyers—Alan Dershouitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among\nthem—tc escape equal justice?\nMichael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to\nthe transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims’ civil suits, in which he explained hou the case against Epstein\nwas minimized by the State Atorney's Office, then bargained doun by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an\natmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several\ncolleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2oo9 and nou runs his oun security firm, objected both to Epstein’s plea\nagreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the\ndeposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered “yes.”\nIn March 2o65, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a l4-year-old girl, launched an\ninvestigation that would eventually uncover a patern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning\nseveral continents, knouingly enabled by Epstein’s associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever\nEpstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl woutd be brought te the mansion on El Brillo Way. (“The younger the\nbeter,” he instructed Haley Robson, a focal teenager whe was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who\ndeclared, on a police tape, that she was “like a Heidi Fleiss,” the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would\nbe giving a “massage,” the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and\nsometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $2oo or more, depending on hou far things\nwent, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,ooo cash on hand.\nThe Palm Beach Potice Department identified l7 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent;\nthe youngest was l4, and many were younger than l6. And that was just at one of Epstein’s many hames around the\nworld—he also ouns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by\nihe FBI, reaching as far back as 2ool, indentified roughly 4o victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein\nreferred to as his “Yugoslavian sex slave” because he had imported her from the Balkans at age l4.

Rodriguez said the girl\nalways needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself\nas a \"human ATM machine\" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a\nminimum balance of $2,ooo dollars on him at all times. When a girl\nwould come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or\nwas not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl\n(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify\nEpstein the amount they were given.

On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located\nin the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located\n“hich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed\n_aich shoued several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed.

She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom.and |\nbathroom.

He was referred by\nassociates and his employment lasted the months of November 2oo4\nthrough May 2oo5. His responsibilities as house manager included\nbeing the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr.\nEpstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had\nvery limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a\nmessage to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary\n\"Leslie\" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal\nassistant, Sarah, who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez\nstated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in\nresidence.\nI asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in\nPalm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked\nspecifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he\nwould have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the\nmorning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.\nRodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them\ncomfortable until either Sarah or Epstein would meet with them.\nRodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allou them\nentry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.\nThey would then be encountered by either Sarah or Epstein. They\nwould be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if\nany of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask\ntheir ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate\nlike his oun daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they\nwould eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time. Rodriguez\nstated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be\nMasseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered\na dozen roses to RM \"igh school for one of the girls\nthat came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high\nschool and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the\nmassages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.\nHe would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and\nwould discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scatered on the floor.\nHe also said he would wipe doun the vibrators and sex toys and put\nthem away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood\narmoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.\nEpstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a\ncar for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive\nher self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl\nalways needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself\nas a “human ATM machine\" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a\nminimum balance of $2,ooo dollars on him at all times. When a girl\nwould come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or\nwas not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl\n(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify\nEpstein the amount they were given.

Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\njokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Weill, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\ngraduated.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many childhood friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a difference [as] our worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225"};
